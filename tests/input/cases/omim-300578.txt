Aldred et al. (1994) reported a family in which 5 males in 3 generations had mild to moderate mental retardation associated with severe, early-onset retinitis pigmentosa. Some affected males also had microcephaly. Although some obligate female carriers showed visual impairment, all were intellectually normal.

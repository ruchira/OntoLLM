Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly-5 (MCPH5) is characterized by decreased occipitofrontal circumference (OFC), usually less than 3 standard deviations (SD) of the mean, present at birth and associated with mental retardation and speech delay. Other features may include short stature or mild seizures. MCPH5 is associated with a simplification of the cerebral cortical gyral pattern in some cases, which is considered within the phenotypic spectrum of primary microcephaly (review by Woods et al., 2005; Saadi et al., 2009; Passemard et al., 2009).

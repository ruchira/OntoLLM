Acinar cells of the salivary gland are a critical part of the oral physiology and the digestive mechanism. These specialized cells are concentrated towards the terminal ends of the salivary glands, where they form sac-like acini or clusters, giving them their name. They are amphicrine in nature, which means they play both secretory and endocrine roles.

The primary function of the acinar cells of the salivary gland is to manufacture and secrete saliva. This substance, comprised mainly of water, electrolytes, mucins, and enzymes, is vital for the initial stages of digestion and for the regular maintenance of oral health. The acinar cells produce the two main types of saliva: serous and mucinous. The serous type, predominantly produced by the parotid gland, contains the enzyme amylase responsible for the initial breakdown of complex carbohydrates. The mucinous type, more common in the submandibular and sublingual glands, contains mucin that aids in lubrication, facilitating the process of mastication and bolus formation.

Moreover, acinar cells also express and respond to various endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine hormones that govern the quantity and composition of the saliva produced. This implies sensitivity and modulation according to the internal and external environment, dietary habits, and even circadian rhythms. Impairment of acinar cells, whether due to damage or related to a systemic condition such as Sj√∂gren's Syndrome, could disrupt the optimal functioning of the oral and digestive systems. In conclusion, acinar cells of the salivary gland, despite their diminutive size, have a substantial role in oral health and overall homeostasis.

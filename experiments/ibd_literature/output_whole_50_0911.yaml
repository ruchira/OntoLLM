  Title: Role of epigenetic modifications mediated by vitamins and trace elements in inflammatory bowel disease.
  Keywords: IBD; epigenetic modifications; inflammatory bowel disease; trace elements; vitamins
  PMID: 37694343
  Abstract: Graphical abstract [Formula: see text] Numerous environmental factors frequently emerge as primary determinants of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Diet is a major component of environmental factors, and the consumption of vitamins (A, B, C and D) and trace elements (calcium, iron, zinc and selenium) exerts an impact on the progression of IBD through epigenetic modifications. Intake of vitamins A, B, C and D, as well as excessive amounts of iron and calcium, can modulate the condition of IBD by regulating the levels of DNA methylation, histone acetylation and miRNA. Zinc and selenium alleviate the progression of IBD by regulating the levels of promoter methylation or histone ubiquitination, respectively.

  Title: Luteolin alleviates ulcerative colitis in rats via regulating immune response, oxidative stress, and metabolic profiling.
  Keywords: immune response; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; luteolin; metabolomics; oxidative stress; ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37693835
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease and associated with metabolic imbalance. Luteolin (LUT) reportedly exhibits anti-inflammatory activity. However, its regulatory effects on metabolites remain indistinct. Here, the effects of LUT on immune response and oxidative stress in UC were determined. Serum metabolomics profiles of UC rats treated with LUT were obtained utilizing liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results revealed that LUT treatment alleviated colon tissue injury, colon shortening, weight loss, and inflammatory response in UC rats. Additionally, the levels of superoxide dismutase and total antioxidant capacity were elevated, but malondialdehyde content was reduced in serum of UC rats, while these changes were abrogated by LUT. Metabolomics analysis unveiled that l-malic acid, creatinine, l-glutamine, and l-lactic acid levels were remarkably decreased, while dimethyl sulfone, 5-methylcytosine, cysteine-S-sulfate, and jasmonic acid levels were notably increased after LUT treatment. Furthermore, differential metabolites primarily participated in d-glutamine and d-glutamate metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and citrate cycle pathways. In summary, these results demonstrated that LUT improved immune response, alleviated oxidative stress, and altered metabolites in UC rats. This study lays the root for further exploring the mechanism of LUT in the treatment of UC.© 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.

  Title: The causal relationship between autoimmune diseases and osteoporosis: a study based on Mendelian randomization.
  Keywords: bone mineral density; fall risk; fracture risk; osteoporosis; two-sample Mendelian randomization
  PMID: 37693362
  Abstract: The relationship between different autoimmune diseases and bone mineral density (BMD) and fractures has been reported in epidemiological studies. This study aimed to explore the causal relationship between autoimmune diseases and BMD, falls, and fractures using Mendelian randomization (MR).The instrumental variables were selected from the aggregated statistical data of these diseases from the largest genome-wide association study in Europe. Specifically, 12 common autoimmune diseases were selected as exposure. Outcome variables included BMD, falls, and fractures. Multiple analysis methods were utilized to comprehensively evaluate the causal relationship between autoimmune diseases and BMD, falls, and fractures. Additionally, sensitivity analyses, including Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, and one analysis, were conducted to verify the result's reliability.Strong evidence was provided in the results of the negatively association of ulcerative colitis (UC) with forearm BMD. UC also had a negatively association with the total body BMD, while inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) depicted a negatively association with the total body BMD at the age of 45-60 years. Horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity was not detected through sensitivity analysis, indicating that the causal estimation was reliable.This study shows a negative causal relationship between UC and forearm and total body BMD, and between IBD and total body BMD at the age of 45-60 years. These results should be considered in future research and when public health measures and osteoporosis prevention strategies are formulated.Copyright © 2023 Wu, Ye, Yan, Zhan, Ren, Zhou, Chen, Yao, Zhu, Wu, Ma, Liu, Fan and Liu.

  Title: Suppressive role of vascular endothelial growth factor on intestinal apoptosis in induced necrotizing enterocolitis in rats.
  Keywords: Animal experimentation; Necrotizing enterocolitis; Vascular endothelial growth factor A
  PMID: 37693290
  Abstract: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating disease that can cause mortality in preterm babies. NEC may develop through an apoptotic pathway that is known to be inhibited by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This study determined whether VEGF exerted a protective effect against the development of NEC and apoptosis in rats.To determine the effect of VEGF in NEC rats, neonatal rats were randomized into 4 groups: the control group, the NEC group, the NEC + intraperitoneal VEGF (50 ng/kg) group (NEC + VEGF IP group), and the NEC + oral VEGF (50 ng/kg) group (NEC + VEGF OR group). NEC was induced by lipopolysaccharide/hypoxia and cold stress. The animals were sacrificed 72 hours later. After laparotomy, we obtained a region of the proximal small bowel from the ileocecal valve about 18 cm in length.The NEC histological grade, apoptosis histological score, and caspase-3 activity were lower in the NEC + VEGF IP and OR groups than in the NEC group. In the NEC + VEGF IP and OR groups, the messenger RNA expression of apoptotic and inflammatory genes, such as Bax, NF-κB, p53, Fas, FasL, and PAF-R, but not that of Bcl-2, was decreased, as was the Bax/Bcl-2 protein ratio. Histological analysis revealed that the apoptosis-blocking effect of VEGF was more effective in the NEC + VEGF IP group than in the NEC + VEGF OR group.We identified apoptotic and inflammatory genes to confirm the preventive effect of VEGF pretreatment on NEC in rats. This study presents a novel approach to prevent apoptosis via VEGF pretreatment in rats with lipopolysaccharide/hypoxia-induced NEC.Copyright © 2023, the Korean Surgical Society.

  Title: Therapeutic effect of bromelain and papain on intestinal injury induced by indomethacin in male rats.
  Keywords: Intestinal injury; bromelain; indomethacin; papain; sulfasalazine
  PMID: 37692988
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are a multiple inflammatory status in small intestines and colon. Bromelain and Papain were cysteine proteases enzymes extracted from pineapple and papaya, and possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory characteristics. Therefore, this comparative work aimed to examine the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effect of bromelain and papain in intestinal inflammation of rats and to evaluate the most potent effect of both types of enzymes.Forty rats were used in this study (8 rats/group), G1: control group, G2: (Indo group) intestinal inflammation was induced by two doses of Indomethacin (7.5 mg/kg body weight) apart 24 h. G3: (Indomethacin + Bromelain) intestinal inflamed rats treated by oral dose of bromelain (1000 mg/kg/day). G4: (Indomethacin + Papain) intestinal inflamed rats treated by oral dose of papain (800 mg/kg/day). G5: (Indomethacin + Sulfasalazine) intestinal inflamed rats treated by oral dose of sulfasalazine (500 mg/kg/day). Oxidative stress and inflammatory markers were measured along with histological assessment.Indomethacin-induced intestinal inflammation (in both Jejunum and Ileum) characterized by increased oxidative stress biomarkers: Xanthine oxidase, Catalase, Glutathione reductase, and Protein carbonyl and Inflammatory biomarkers: Tumor necrosis factor-α, Interleukin-10, Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, Nuclear factor-kappa β, C-reactive protein, and Prostaglandin E2, as compared to control rats. On the other hand, administering either bromelain or Papain would effectively decrease symptoms of intestinal inflammation and modulate biomarkers of oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines.Comparing results revealed that bromelain showed the most potent protective effect and possesses an apparent role in protection against the development of intestinal inflammation.Copyright: © International Journal of Health Sciences.

  Title: Association between inflammatory bowel disease and pancreatic cancer: results from the two-sample Mendelian randomization study.
  Keywords: Crohn’s disease; GWAS; inflammatory bowel disease; mendelian randomization; pancreatic cancer; risk factor; ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37692850
  Abstract: The nuanced relationship between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and pancreatic cancer is noticed in recent years. However, the underlying causal effects of these two diseases are still unclear.The two-sample mendelian randomization (MR) was conducted to explore the causal effect of IBD condition on pancreatic cancer. Methods of Wald ratio, inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode were used to investigate the causal relationship between IBD and pancreatic cancer. Besides, Cochrane's Q test, MR-Egger, and leave-one-out method were further conducted to detect heterogeneity, stability, and pleiotropy of MR results.In the MR analysis, we found Crohn's disease had a significant causal effect on pancreatic cancer. Specifically, Crohn's disease would increase 11.1% the risk of pancreatic cancer by the IVW method (p= 0.022), 33.8% by MR Egger (p= 0.015), by 35.3% by the Weighted model (p= 0.005). Regarding ulcerative colitis, there was no statistically significant causal effect observed on pancreatic cancer (p>0.05). Additionally, the pleiotropic test and Leave-one-out analysis both proved the validity and reliability of the present two-sample MR analyses.This study indicates that IBD, particularly Crohn's disease, is causality associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer. Our results may help public health managers to make better follow-up surveillance of IBD patients.Copyright © 2023 Min, Liu, Li, Jin, Wei, Pei, Hu and Peng.

  Title: Association of serum lipids with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
  Keywords: Cronh’s disease; inflammatory bowel disease; meta-analysis; serum lipids; ulcerative disease
  PMID: 37692785
  Abstract: Serum lipid levels seem to be abnormal in Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the specific manifestation of abnormal serum lipid levels in IBD are heterogeneous among studies and have not been sufficiently determined yet.PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched. Serum lipid levels were compared between IBD patients and Health individuals, Crohn's (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), active and inactive, mild and non-mild patients, respectively. Meta-analyses were performed by using a random-effect model. Weight mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.Overall, 53 studies were included. Compared with healthy controls, IBD patients had significantly lower TC (WMD = -0.506, 95%CI = -0.674 to -0.338, p < 0.001), HDL-c (WMD = -0.122, 95%CI = -0.205 to -0.039, p = 0.004), and LDL-c (WMD = -0.371, 95%CI = -0.547 to -0.194, p < 0.001) levels. CD groups had a significantly lower TC (WMD = -0.349, 95%CI = -0.528 to -0.170, p < 0.0001) level as compared to UC groups. Active IBD and non-mild UC groups had significantly lower TC (WMD = -0.454, 95%CI = -0.722 to -0.187, p = 0.001) (WMD =0.462, 95%CI = 0.176 to 0.748, p = 0.002) and LDL-c (WMD = -0.225, 95%CI = -0.445 to -0.005, p = 0.045) (WMD =0.346, 95%CI = 0.084-0.609, p = 0.010) levels as compared to inactive IBD and mild UC groups, respectively.The overall level of serum lipids in IBD patients is lower than that of healthy individuals and is negatively associated with disease severity.https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier: CRD42022383885.Copyright © 2023 Chen, Li, Hu, Xu, Lu, Zhu and Shen.

  Title: Guardians of the gut: influence of the enteric nervous system on the intestinal epithelial barrier.
  Keywords: enteric glia; enteric nervous system; gut epithelial barrier; inflammatory bowel disease; intrinsic primary afferent neurons
  PMID: 37692784
  Abstract: The intestinal mucosal surface forms one of the largest areas of the body, which is in direct contact with the environment. Co-ordinated sensory functions of immune, epithelial, and neuronal cells ensure the timely detection of noxious queues and potential pathogens and elicit proportional responses to mitigate the threats and maintain homeostasis. Such tuning and maintenance of the epithelial barrier is constantly ongoing during homeostasis and its derangement can become a gateway for systemic consequences. Although efforts in understanding the gatekeeping functions of immune cells have led the way, increasing number of studies point to a crucial role of the enteric nervous system in fine-tuning and maintaining this delicate homeostasis. The identification of immune regulatory functions of enteric neuropeptides and glial-derived factors is still in its infancy, but has already yielded several intriguing insights into their important contribution to the tight control of the mucosal barrier. In this review, we will first introduce the reader to the current understanding of the architecture of the enteric nervous system and the epithelial barrier. Next, we discuss the key discoveries and cellular pathways and mediators that have emerged as links between the enteric nervous, immune, and epithelial systems and how their coordinated actions defend against intestinal infectious and inflammatory diseases. Through this review, the readers will gain a sound understanding of the current neuro-immune-epithelial mechanisms ensuring intestinal barrier integrity and maintenance of intestinal homeostasis.Copyright © 2023 Bubeck, Becker and Patankar.

  Title: Clostridioides difficile Infection in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Systematic Review of Risk Factors and Approach in Management.
  Keywords: chron’s disease; clostridioides difficile infection; inflammatory bowel disease; risk factors  ; ulcerative colıtıs
  PMID: 37692651
  Abstract: Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is one of the most common diseases associated with medical care, having a more significant impact on patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The latest studies have proposed a change in management for CDI in IBD patients. This study aims to perform a systematic review that explores the risk factors associated with the infection and the most optimal approach in management. Multiple databases were used for this research, including PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Cochrane Library. Studies published in the last five years in the English language were selected based on pre-established criteria. The quality assessment used was the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Review, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria in this systematic review, including literature reviews, a case and control study, and systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Based on the findings in this research, we conclude that the treatment for an initial episode of CDI in IBD patients is the use of antibiotics, vancomycin, or fidaxomicin. For episodes of recurrent CDI (rCDI), fetal microbiota transplantation should be considered. The most common risk factors associated are gut microbiota disturbances, the use of antibiotics, and hospitalization. Due to a wide range of risk factors mentioned in some studies but disregarded in others, further research is needed to determine the most prevalent risk factors.Copyright © 2023, Sangurima et al.

  Title: Patient perceptions of copay card utilization and policies.
  Keywords: Accumulator; copay assistance programs; insurance design; maximizer; out-of-pocket healthcare costs; prescription drug patient assistance programs
  PMID: 37692554
  Abstract: Copay cards are intended to mitigate patient out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses. This qualitative, exploratory focus group study aimed to capture patient perceptions of copay cards and copay adjustment programs (CAPs; insurers' accumulator and maximizer policies), which redirect the copay card utilization benefits intended for patients' OOP expenses.Patients with chronic conditions were recruited through Janssen's Patient Engagement Research Council program. They completed a survey and attended a live virtual session to provide feedback on copay cards.Among 33 participants (median age, 49 years [range, 24-78]), the most frequent conditions were cardiovascular-metabolic disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Patients associated copay cards with lessening financial burden, improving general and mental health, and enabling medication adherence. An impact on medication adherence was identified by 10 (63%) White and nine (100%) Black respondents. Some patients were unaware of CAPs despite having encountered them; they recommended greater copay card education and transparency about CAPs.Patients relied on copay cards to help afford their prescribed medication OOP expenses and maintain medication adherence. Use of CAPs may increase patient OOP expenses. Patients would benefit from awareness programs and industry - healthcare provider partnerships that facilitate and ensure access to copay cards.© 2023 Jannsen Scientific Affairs, LLC.

  Keywords: GWAS; comorbidities; epidemiology; psoriasis
  PMID: 37692276
  Abstract: Psoriasis is a chronic disease, which is associated with numerous genetic and environmental factors. The high prevalence of psoriasis worldwide (2-3% of the general population) and its various comorbidities lead to research on its pathogenesis. The aim of this article is to describe the current state of knowledge on the potential links between psoriasis and other diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases, uveitis, arthritis, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, fatty liver disease, dyslipidaemia, sleep apnoea, celiac disease, lymphoma, erectile dysfunction, Parkinson's disease, osteoporosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, psychiatric disorders and substance use. Further research in this area may lead to better treatment options in the future.Copyright: © 2023 Termedia Sp. z o. o.

  Title: Inflammation in the proximal colon is a risk factor for the development of colorectal neoplasia in inflammatory bowel disease patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.
  Keywords: IBD variants; dysplasia; right colon
  PMID: 37692199
  Abstract: Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased risk of developing colorectal neoplasia (CRN) in the proximal colon.To evaluate whether duration and severity of inflammation are linked to the development of CRN in this population.Retrospective, case-control chart review of patients with PSC and IBD at a tertiary care center.Disease activity was scored per colonic segment at each colonoscopy prior to the first instance of observed CRN using a modified Mayo endoscopic sub-score and histologic assessment. Patients in the CRN-positive group were compared to controls that did not.In all, 72 PSC-IBD patients with no history of CRN were identified, 13 of whom developed CRN after at least one colonoscopy at our institution. Patients in the CRN-positive group had significantly more endoscopic (p < 0.01) and histologic (p < 0.01) inflammation in the right compared to the control group prior to the development of dysplasia. There was significantly greater endoscopic inflammation in the segment of the colon with a dysplastic lesion than other segments of the colon (p = 0.018). Patients with moderate/severe lifetime endoscopic (p = 0.02) or histologic inflammation (p = 0.04) score had a lower probability of remaining free of dysplasia during follow-up. Nearly half of the patients with dysplasia had invisible lesions found on random biopsy.Endoscopic and histologic inflammation in the proximal colon are risk factors for CRN in patients with PSC-IBD. PSC-IBD patients frequently have subclinical inflammation, and these findings support the practice of regular assessment of disease activity and random biopsy of inflamed and uninflamed areas in patients with PSC with the goal of reducing inflammation to prevent the development of CRN.© The Author(s), 2023.

  Title: The persistence of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies after COVID-19: A one-year observation. Is a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination booster dose necessary?
  Keywords: COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; vaccination
  PMID: 37692027
  Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) one year after contracting COVID-19.The study included 38 patients - 34 men and 4 women - suffering from COVID-19 between March 15 and May 26, 2020. The median age in the group was 31 years, ranging from 22 to 67 years. The levels of neutralizing antibodies were measured at three time-points - baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. The primary endpoint was a post-infection positive result for NAbs (> 15 AU/ml; Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG quantitative test) 12 months after infection.The median level of NAbs after 12 months was 26.5 AU/ml. At the end of observation (12 months), 21 of the 38 patients had a NAb level of >15 AU/ml (positive). The median antibody half-life was 5.8 months.A high percentage of the patients maintained positive levels of antibodies 6 and 12 months after COVID-19 infection. The dynamics of the antibody level decline suggests the need for booster vaccination at least once a year.Copyright © 2023 Termedia.

  Title: IBD Camp Oasis: A look at Participants' Social-Emotional Well-Being and Protective Factors During Camp and Beyond.
  Keywords: Crohn’s disease; IBD; camp; mental health; pediatric IBD; ulcerative colitis; well-being
  PMID: 37691728
  Abstract: Camp Oasis is an annual week-long camp serving children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and hosted by the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation. Youth with IBD are at increased risk for mental health challenges, with Camp Oasis potentially mitigating these risks. The aim of this study is to measure change in and predictors of social-emotional well-being and protective factors of self-worth as a result of attending Camp Oasis.Between 2012 and 2019, a voluntary survey was administered to participants and their caregivers to reflect on their perceptions of social/emotional well-being and protective factors related to chronic disease. T-tests compared change in participants' and caregivers' perceptions before and after camp; path analyses examined the key predictors of social-emotional well-being.A total of 6011 online surveys were analyzed. Participants and caregivers reported consistently positive perceptions of participants' experiences during and after camp. Significant improvements in confidence, independence, activity, comfort around others, being more open about disease, and taking medication as expected were observed. Being new to Camp Oasis was one of the strongest predictors of both disease-related self-efficacy and social connections after camp.The uniformly high rates of participants' perceptions during camp suggest camp is a life-changing experience for youth with IBD, reduces disease-related stigma, and enhances confidence and social skills. Participants' positive experiences appear to foster notable benefits after camp in terms of openness, their sense of belonging, connections, and confidence.© The Author(s) 2023.

  Title: Defects in microvillus crosslinking sensitize to colitis and inflammatory bowel disease.
  Keywords: CDHR5; MUCDHL; brush border; colitis; microvilli
  PMID: 37691494
  Abstract: Intestinal epithelial cells are covered by the brush border, which consists of densely packed microvilli. The Intermicrovillar Adhesion Complex (IMAC) links the microvilli and is required for proper brush border organization. Whether microvillus crosslinking is involved in the intestinal barrier function or colitis is currently unknown. We investigate the role of microvillus crosslinking in colitis in mice with deletion of the IMAC component CDHR5. Electron microscopy shows pronounced brush border defects in CDHR5-deficient mice. The defects result in severe mucosal damage after exposure to the colitis-inducing agent DSS. DSS increases the permeability of the mucus layer and brings bacteria in direct contact with the disorganized brush border of CDHR5-deficient mice. This correlates with bacterial invasion into the epithelial cell layer which precedes epithelial apoptosis and inflammation. Single-cell RNA sequencing data of patients with ulcerative colitis reveals downregulation of CDHR5 in enterocytes of diseased areas. Our results provide experimental evidence that a combination of microvillus crosslinking defects with increased permeability of the mucus layer sensitizes to inflammatory bowel disease.© 2023 The Authors.

  Title: Systemic immune-inflammation index as a potential biomarker to monitor ulcerative colitis.
  Keywords: endoscopic improvement; histological healing; systemic immune-inflammation index; treat-to-target; ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37691449
  Abstract: The treat-to-target strategy is recommended by Selecting Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease II (STRIDE-II) for treating ulcerative colitis (UC), and monitoring remission status is crucial during this management. The systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), defined as platelet * neutrophil/lymphocyte, is a complete blood count-based index reflecting the balance of immune and inflammatory status. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of SII for diagnosing UC and monitoring UC disease activity.This study retrospectively analyzed patients with UC and controls. Relationships between SII and Mayo clinical score, Mayo Endoscopic Score (MES), and Nancy Histological Index (NHI) were evaluated.167 patients with UC and 106 controls were included. SII significantly increased in patients with UC and was closely correlated with the Mayo clinical score, MES, and NHI. SII diagnosed UC with a cut-off value of 619.1 × 109/L (area under the curve = 0.861, p < 0.0001, sensitivity 79.64%, specificity 77.36%), evaluated clinical remission status with a cut-off value of 1068 × 109/L (area under the curve = 0.691, p < 0.05, sensitivity 55.71%, specificity 81.48%), endoscopic improvement with a cut-off value of 981.3 × 109/L (area under the curve = 0.819, p < 0.0001, sensitivity 65.22%, specificity 89.66%), and histological healing with a cut-off value of 689.3 × 109/L (area under the curve = 0.898, p < 0.0001, sensitivity 88.89%, specificity 95.83%).SII is a potential biomarker for diagnosing UC and monitoring UC disease severity, especially in evaluating mucosal and histological healing during the long-term management in treat-to-target strategy. However, further research is needed to confirm its usefulness and optimize its clinical application.

  Title: High-Salt-Diet (HSD) aggravates the progression of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) via regulating epithelial necroptosis.
  Keywords: HSD; IBD; Necroptosis; RIPK3
  PMID: 37691056
  Abstract: Due to its unclear etiology, there is no specific medicine to cure the recurrent and incurable inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Unhealthy dietary habits unconsciously contributed to the progression of IBD, for example a High-Salt-Diet (HSD) is the most neglected and frequently adopted habit. However, the molecular mechanism of how HSD aggravates the progression of IBD has yet to remain uncovered. Herein, we focus on the hypothesis that necroptosis pathway may be involved in the process of IBD exacerbated by HSD. To this end, different gene expression (DEGs) profiles of human epithelia under hypertonic culture conditions were applied to screen candidate pathways. What's more, gene expression manipulation, immune microenvironment detection, RIPK3/MLKL gene knockout (KO), and wild-type (WT) mice were carried out to research the promotion of IBD progression under treatments of high salt intake. Based on our present results, gene expression profiles in human normal colon epithelia cell NCM460 were significantly changed under salt- or sucrose-induced hypertonic culture conditions. RIPK3 was significantly up-regulated under both conditions. Furthermore, mice colon epithelia cell CT26 growth was inhibited in a time- and dose-dependent manner by extra NaCl incubation. Autophagy, and Necroptosis pathways were activated and enhanced by LPS pretreatment. HSD significantly exacerbated DSS-induced IBD symptoms in vivo in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, RIPK3-/- and MLKL-/- mice presented severe IBD symptoms in vivo. Overall, the results demonstrated that HSD aggravated the IBD progression via necroptosis activation, providing novel strategies and promising targets for the clinical treatment of IBD.© 2023.

  Title: Esculentoside A ameliorates BSCB destruction in SCI rat by attenuating the TLR4 pathway in vascular endothelial cells.
  Keywords: Blood spinal cord barrier; Esculentoside A; MMP-9; Spinal cord injury; TLR4
  PMID: 37690527
  Abstract: Overexpressed MMP-9 in vascular endothelial cells is involved in blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) dysfunction in spinal cord injury (SCI). Esculentoside A (EsA) has anti-inflammatory and cell protective effects. This study aimed to evaluate its effects on neuromotor function in SCI rats, as well as the potential mechanisms.The therapeutic effect of EsA in SCI rats was investigated using Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scores, a grid walk test and histological analyses. To assess the protective role of EsA in the BSCB and in oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-induced hBMECs, the BSCB function, tight junctions (TJ) protein (ZO-1 and claudin-5) expression, structure of the BSCB and Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression were observed via Evans blue (EB) detection, immunofluorescence analyses and western blotting. Molecular docking simulations and additional experiments were performed to explore the potential mechanisms by which EsA maintains the function of the BSCB in vivo and in vitro.EsA treatment improved BBB scores, reduced cavity formation and the loss of neuronal cells, demonstrating an improvement in motor function in SCI rats. In vivo experiments showed that EsA decreased the infiltration of blood cells and inflammatory mediators (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) and protected the structure of TJs in the rat spinal cord and in OGD/R-induced hBMECs. EsA inhibited the activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signalling, which may be related to the protective effect of EsA against MMP-9-induced BSCB damage.EsA downregulated MMP-9 expression in vascular endothelial cells, protected BSCB function in SCI rats and attenuated TLR4 signalling and thus provide new options for the treatment of SCI.Copyright © 2023.

  Title: Management of the Rectal Stump after Subtotal Colectomy Operations for Inflammatory Bowel Disease in the Era of Immunologic Therapy: A Two-Centre Cohort Study.
  Keywords: Completion proctectomy; Immunobiologic therapy; Inflammatory bowel disease; Rectal stump; Subtotal colectomy
  PMID: 37690444
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often requires surgical resection, such as subtotal colectomy operations to alleviate symptoms. However, IBD also has an inherently increased risk of colorectal dysplasia and cancer. Despite the well-accepted surveillance guidelines for IBD patients with an intact colon, contemporaneous decision-making models on rectal stump surveillance is sparse. This study looks at the fate of rectal stumps in IBD patients following subtotal colectomy.This is a two-centre retrospective observational cohort study. Patients were identified from NHS Grampian and NHS Highland surgical IBD databases. Patients that had subtotal colectomy between January 01, 2010 and December 31, 2017 were included with the follow-up end date on April 1, 2021. Socio-demographics, diagnosis, medical and surgical management data were collected from electronic records.Of 250 patients who had subtotal colectomy procedures, only one developed a cancer in their rectal stump (0.4%) over a median follow-up of 80 months. A higher than expected 72% of patients had ongoing symptoms from their rectal stumps. Surveillance was varied and inconsistent. However, no surveillance, flexible sigmoidoscopy, or MRI identified dysplastic or neoplastic disease.Based on our results, we estimate that the prevalence of rectal cancer is lower than previously reported. Surveillance strategy of rectal stump varied as no current guidelines exist and hence is an important area for future study. Given the relatively low frequency of rectal cancer in these patients, and the low level of evidence available in this field, we would propose a registry-based approach to answering this important clinical question.© 2023 The Author(s).

  Title: Artificial Intelligence Quantifying Endoscopic Severity of Ulcerative Colitis in Gradation Scale.
  Keywords: Artificial Intelligence; Convolutional Neural Network; Ranking; Ulcerative Colitis
  PMID: 37690125
  Abstract: Existing endoscopic scores for Ulcerative Colitis (UC) objectively categorize the disease severity based on the presence or absence of endoscopic findings. Therefore, it may not reflect the range of clinical severity within each category. However, Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) expert endoscopists categorize the severity and diagnose the overall impression of the degree of inflammation. This study aimed to develop artificial intelligence (AI) system that can accurately represent the assessment of the endoscopic severity of UC by IBD expert endoscopists.A ranking-convolutional neural network (ranking-CNN) was trained using comparative information on the UC severity of 13,826 endoscopic images pairs created by IBD expert endoscopists. Using the trained ranking-CNN, the UC Endoscopic Gradation Scale (UCEGS) was used to express severity. Correlation coefficients were calculated to ensure that there were no inconsistencies in assessments of severity made using UCEGS diagnosed by the AI and the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES), and the correlation coefficients of the mean for test images that had been assessed using UCEGS by four IBD expert endoscopists, and the AI.Spearman's correlation coefficient between the UCEGS diagnosed by AI and MES was approximately 0.89. The correlation coefficients between IBD expert endoscopists and the AI of the evaluation results were all higher than 0.95 (P<0.01).The AI developed here can diagnose UC severity endoscopically similar to IBD expert endoscopists.

  Title: Colon-Accumulated Gold Nanoclusters Alleviate Intestinal Inflammation and Prevent Secondary Colorectal Carcinogenesis via Nrf2-Dependent Macrophage Reprogramming.

  PMID: 37690027
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is one of the main factors leading to colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). Therefore, it is critical to develop an effective treatment for IBD to prevent secondary colorectal carcinogenesis. M2 macrophages play crucial roles in the resolution phase of intestinal inflammation. However, traditional drugs rarely target intestinal M2 macrophages, and they are not easily cleared. Gold nanoclusters are known for their in vivo safety and intrinsic biomedical activities. In this study, a glutathione-protected gold nanocluster is synthesized and evaluated, namely, GA. Interestingly, GA specifically accumulates in the colon during IBD. Furthermore, GA not only promotes M2 differentiation of IL-4-treated peritoneal macrophages but also reprograms macrophage polarization from M1 to M2 in a pro-inflammatory environment. Mechanistically, this regulatory effect is exerted through activating the antioxidant Nrf2 signaling pathway, but not traditional STAT6. When applied in IBD mice, we found that GA elevates M2 macrophages and alleviates IBD in an Nrf2-dependent manner, evidenced by the abolished therapeutic effect upon Nrf2 inhibitor treatment. Most importantly, GA administration significantly suppresses AOM/DSS-induced CAC, without causing obvious tissue damage, providing critical evidence for the potential application of gold nanoclusters as nanomedicine for the treatment of IBD and CAC.

  Title: Detecting potential causal relationship between inflammatory bowel disease and rosacea using bi-directional Mendelian randomization.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37689807
  Abstract: The association between rosacea and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been studied in previous observational studies. It is unclear, however, whether the association is causal or not. Independent genetic variants for IBD were chosen as instruments from published Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) studies involving 38,155 cases with an IBD diagnosis and 48,485 controls in order to investigate the causal effect of IBD on rosacea. Summarized data for rosacea were gathered from various GWAS studies that included 1195 cases and 211,139 controls without rosacea. Reverse-direction Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was done to investigate the relationship between genetically proxied rosacea and IBD. With the use of the inverse variance-weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, and weighted median approaches, a 2-sample Mendelian randomization study was carried out. Analysis of heterogeneity and sensitivity was performed to examine the pleiotropy and robustness of effect estimates. The forward-direction of the MR study was to reveal that genetic predisposition to IBD including its two main subtypes: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) was associated with an increased risk of rosacea. The reverse-direction MR analyses did not demonstrate that a genetic predisposition to rosacea was associated with total IBD, UC and CD. Our findings provided evidence for a causal impact of IBD, UC, and CD on rosacea, but not vice versa. The elevated incidence of rosacea in patients with IBD should be recognized by doctors to make an early diagnosis and initiate specialized therapy.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited.

  Title: Adropin deficiency worsens TNBS-induced colitis.
  Keywords: Adropin; Inflammatory bowel disease; Metabolomics; PPARγ; Polarization of macrophages
  PMID: 37688913
  Abstract: The aim of this study was to describe the effects of adropin deficiency on the distribution, phenotype and pathological phenotype of macrophages in colonic and mesenteric tissues of AdrKO (Enho-/-) mice, so as to explore the mechanism of adropin deficiency in spontaneous and experimental colitis. In this study, RNA-seq and metabonomics were used to screen the regulatory mechanism of adropin on the phenotypic transformation of macrophages. We found that adropin levels in active UC patients were significantly lower than those in normal subjects and remission UC patients, and at the same time, a large number of proinflammatory M1-type macrophages were infiltrated in the mesenteric tissue of colonic tissues from UC and CD patients. At the same time, spontaneous colitis occurred in Enho-/- (adropin-deficient)C57BL/6 mice, and there was an imbalance of M2 → M1 polarization of macrophages in colon and mesentery of Enho-/- mice. In vivo, it has showed that adropin deficiency could exacerbate the pathological phenotype of colitis induced by TNBS. In vitro, adropin was used to intervene RAW264.7 macrophages, and then combined analysis of RNA-seq and metabolomics demonstrated that adropin regulated lipid metabolism of macrophages through PPARγ, thus promoting the repolarization of macrophages from M1 to M2. Adropin deficiency led to an imbalance in the phenotypic distribution of macrophages infiltrating the colon and mesenteric tissues, namely, an increase in M1 type, which led to the occurrence and development of colitis.Copyright © 2023.

  Title: Research models to mimic Necrotizing Enterocolitis and Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: focus on Extracellular Vesicles action.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37688386
  Abstract: This review focuses on the crucial role of the Intestinal epithelium in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and its significance in the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). NEC is a devastating neonatal disease, while IBD represents a global healthcare problem with increasing incidence. The breakdown of the intestinal barrier in neonates is considered pivotal in the development and progression of both disorders. This review provides an overview of the current state of in-vitro, ex-vivo and animal models to study epithelial injury in NEC and IBD, addressing pertinent questions that engage clinicians and researchers alike. Despite significant advancements in early recognition and aggressive treatment, no single therapy has been conclusively proven effective in reducing the severity of these disorders. Although early interventions have improved clinical outcomes, NEC and IBD continue to impose substantial morbidity, mortality and economic burdens on affected individuals and society. Consequently, exploring alternative therapeutic options capable of preventing and treating the sequelae of NEC and IBD has become a pressing necessity. In recent decades, extracellular vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a potential solution to modulate the pathogenic mechanism in these multifactorial and complex disorders. Despite the diverse array of proposed models, a comprehensive model to investigate and decelerate the progression of NEC and IBD remains to be established. To bridge the translational gap between preclinical studies and clinical applications, enhancements in the technical development of gut-on-a-chip models and EVs hold considerable promise.© The Author(s) 2023.

  Title: Momordica charantia-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Provide Antioxidant Protection in Ulcerative Colitis.
  Keywords: Momordica charantia; antioxidant; extracellular vesicles; protein domain analysis; ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37687011
  Abstract: Plant-derived extracellular vesicles are functional nanovesicles that have significant applications in both disease prevention and treatment, as well as for use as drug carriers. Momordica charantia is a widely consumed food that has both medicinal and nutritional properties and has shown intervention in diabetes and inflammation caused by oxidative damage. In this study, Momordica charantia-derived extracellular vesicles (MCEVs) were extracted and demonstrated to have excellent antioxidant activity by characterization, lipid composition analysis, protein domain analysis, and in vitro antioxidant measurement. In addition, in vivo studies indicated that the MCEVs could restore ulcerative colitis by regulating oxidation and inflammatory factors. Therefore, the antioxidant properties of MCEVs may be important in protecting the colon from inflammation, which provides new insights into the application of MCEVs as drugs or vectors for intervention in ulcerative colitis.

  Title: Magnetic Resonance Imaging Can Be Used to Assess Sarcopenia in Children with Newly Diagnosed Crohn's Disease.
  Keywords: body composition; children; inflammatory bowel disease; paraspinal muscle; psoas muscle
  PMID: 37686870
  Abstract: This study aimed to determine the proportion of patients with sarcopenia diagnosed by MRI and compare these results to bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA).Children with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease (CD) who had MRI enterography (MRE) and BIA and had at least 12 months of follow-up were included. Total psoas muscle area (TPMA) and total paravertebral muscle (TPVM) were measured and compared to subjects' lean mass and the lean mass body index (LMBI) was assessed by BIA.30 newly diagnosed children with CD were included (mean age 14.2 years, 53% male). Sarcopenia was found in 13 (43%) children; mean TPMA was 15.2 (1.1 SD) cm2 and TPVM 30.95 (1.7 SD) cm2. A highly positive correlation was shown for lean mass assessed by BIA and TPMA (0.706, p < 0.001) and TPVM (0.75, p < 0.001). Sarcopenia was more prevalent in boys (77% vs. 24%, p = 0.004), patients with the perianal disease (69% vs. 29%, p = 0.03), and children with sarcopenia were likely to receive anti-TNF (77% vs. 41%, p = 0.05). During the follow-up period, 16 (53%) children experienced a relapse. TPMA (HR 0.99, p = 0.018) and TPVM (HR 0.99, p = 0.031) values were statistically significant risk factors for relapse.A high proportion of patients with CD have sarcopenia at the time of the diagnosis. There is a good correlation between muscle mass assessed by MRI and BIA. Because MRI is performed in a great proportion of newly diagnosed CD patients it can also be used to assess the presence of sarcopenia.

  Title: Nutrition, Nutritional Status, Micronutrients Deficiency, and Disease Course of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Keywords: anemia; inflammatory bowel disease; micronutrients; nutrition; obesity; sarcopenia
  PMID: 37686856
  Abstract: During the disease course, most Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients present a condition of malnutrition, undernutrition, or even overnutrition. These conditions are mainly due to suboptimal nutritional intake, alterations in nutrient requirements and metabolism, malabsorption, and excessive gastrointestinal losses. A suboptimal nutritional status and low micronutrient serum levels can have a negative impact on both induction and maintenance of remission and on the quality of life of Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients. We performed a systematic review including all the studies evaluating the connection between nutrition, nutrition status (including undernutrition and overnutrition), micronutrient deficiency, and both disease course and therapeutic response in Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients. This systematic review was performed using PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus. Four main clinical settings concerning the effect of nutrition on disease course in adult Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients were analyzed (induction of remission, maintenance of remission, risk of surgery, post-operative recurrence, and surgery-related complications). Four authors independently reviewed abstracts and manuscripts for eligibility. 6077 articles were found; 762 duplicated studies were removed. Out of 412 full texts analyzed, 227 were included in the review. The evidence summarized in this review showed that many nutritional aspects could be potential targets to induce a better control of symptoms, a deeper remission, and overall improve the quality of life of Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients.

  Title: The Importance of Antioxidant Activity for the Health-Promoting Effect of Lycopene.
  Keywords: lycopene; neurodegenerative diseases; neuroinflammation
  PMID: 37686853
  Abstract: Lycopene is a compound of colored origin that shows strong antioxidant activity. The positive effect of lycopene is the result of its pleiotropic effect. The ability to neutralize free radicals via lycopene is one of the foundations of its pro-health effect, including the ability to inhibit the development of many civilization diseases. Therefore, this study focuses on the importance of the antioxidant effect of lycopene in inhibiting the development of diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diseases within the nervous system, diabetes, liver diseases, and ulcerative colitis. According to the research mentioned, lycopene supplementation has significant promise for the treatment of illnesses marked by chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. However, the majority of the supporting data for lycopene's health benefits comes from experimental research, whereas the evidence from clinical studies is both scarcer and less certain of any health benefits. Research on humans is still required to establish its effectiveness.

  Title: VDUP1 Deficiency Promotes the Severity of DSS-Induced Colitis in Mice by Inducing Macrophage Infiltration.
  Keywords: NF-κB; VDUP1; inflammation; macrophage infiltration; ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37686390
  Abstract: The loss of vitamin D3 upregulated protein 1 (VDUP1) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various inflammation-related diseases. Notably, reduced expression of VDUP1 has been observed in clinical specimens of ulcerative colitis (UC). However, the role of VDUP1 deficiency in colitis remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of VDUP1 in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental colitis in mice. VDUP1-deficient mice were more susceptible to DSS-induced colitis than their wild-type (WT) littermates after 2% DSS administration. VDUP1-deficient mice exhibited an increased disease activity index (DAI) and histological scores, as well as significant colonic goblet cell loss and an increase in apoptotic cells. These changes were accompanied by a significant decrease in MUC2 mRNA expression and a marked increase in proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines within damaged tissues. Furthermore, phosphorylated NF-κB p65 expression was significantly upregulated in damaged tissues in the context of VDUP1 deficiency. VDUP1 deficiency also led to significant infiltration of macrophages into the site of ulceration. An in vitro chemotaxis assay confirmed that VDUP1 deficiency enhanced bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) chemotaxis induced by CCL2. Overall, this study highlights VDUP1 as a regulator of UC pathogenesis and a potential target for the future development of therapeutic strategies.

  Title: Long Non-Coding RNAs and Their "Discrete" Contribution to IBD and Johne's Disease-What Stands out in the Current Picture? A Comprehensive Review.
  Keywords: Crohn; Johne’s disease; biomarker; colitis; epigenetic; inflammatory bowel disease; long non-coding RNAs; mycobacter; regulation
  PMID: 37686376
  Abstract: Non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) have paved the way to new perspectives on the regulation of gene expression, not only in biology and medicine, but also in associated fields and technologies, ensuring advances in diagnostic means and therapeutic modalities. Critical in this multistep approach are the associations of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) with diseases and their causal genes in their networks of interactions, gene enrichment and expression analysis, associated pathways, the monitoring of the involved genes and their functional roles during disease progression from one stage to another. Studies have shown that Johne's Disease (JD), caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies partuberculosis (MAP), shares common lncRNAs, clinical findings, and other molecular entities with Crohn's Disease (CD). This has been a subject of vigorous investigation owing to the zoonotic nature of this condition, although results are still inconclusive. In this review, on one hand, the current knowledge of lncRNAs in cells is presented, focusing on the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal-related pathologies and MAP-related infections and, on the other hand, we attempt to dissect the associated genes and pathways involved. Furthermore, the recently characterized and novel lncRNAs share common pathologies with IBD and JD, including the expression, molecular networks, and dataset analysis results. These are also presented in an attempt to identify potential biomarkers pertinent to cattle and human disease phenotypes.

  Title: A Deep View of the Biological Property of Interleukin-33 and Its Dysfunction in the Gut.
  Keywords: IL-33; biological characteristics; gastrointestinal cancer; inflammatory bowel disease; nuclear IL-33
  PMID: 37686309
  Abstract: Intestinal diseases have always posed a serious threat to human health, with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) being one of them. IBD is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation, including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The "alarm" cytokine IL-33, which is intimately associated with Th2 immunity, is a highly potent inflammatory factor that is considered to have dual functions-operating as both a pro-inflammatory cytokine and a transcriptional regulator. IL-33 has been shown to play a crucial role in both the onset and development of IBD. Therefore, this review focuses on the pathogenesis of IBD, the major receptor cell types, and the activities of IL-33 in innate and adaptive immunity, as well as its underlying mechanisms and conflicting conclusions in IBD. We have also summarized different medicines targeted to IL-33-associated diseases. Furthermore, we have emphasized the role of IL-33 in gastrointestinal cancer and parasitic infections, giving novel prospective therapeutic utility in the future application of IL-33.

  Title: Inflammation and Digestive Cancer.
  Keywords: carcinogenesis; chronic gastritis; chronic hepatitis; colon cancer; gastric cancer; hepatocellular carcinoma; hormonal carcinogenesis; inflammation; inflammatory bowel disease; mechanism
  PMID: 37686307
  Abstract: Chronic inflammation is linked to carcinogenesis, particularly in the digestive organs, i.e., the stomach, colon, and liver. The mechanism of this effect has, however, only partly been focused on. In this review, we focus on different forms of chronic hepatitis, chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and chronic gastritis, conditions predisposing individuals to the development of malignancy. Chronic inflammation may cause malignancy because (1) the cause of the chronic inflammation is itself genotoxic, (2) substances released from the inflammatory cells may be genotoxic, (3) the cell death induced by the inflammation induces a compensatory increase in proliferation with an inherent risk of mutation, (4) changes in cell composition due to inflammation may modify function, resulting in hormonal disturbances affecting cellular proliferation. The present review focuses on chronic gastritis (Helicobacter pylori or autoimmune type) since all four mechanisms may be relevant to this condition. Genotoxicity due to the hepatitis B virus is an important factor in hepatocellular cancer and viral infection can similarly be central in the etiology and malignancy of inflammatory bowel diseases. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the dominating cause of chronic gastritis and has not been shown to be genotoxic, so its carcinogenic effect is most probably due to the induction of atrophic oxyntic gastritis leading to hypergastrinemia.

  Title: Unmet Challenges in Patients with Crohn's Disease.
  Keywords: Crohn’s disease; biomarkers; endoscopy; inflammatory bowel disease; tumor necrosis factor inhibitors
  PMID: 37685662
  Abstract: Patients with Crohn's disease can present with a variety of clinical manifestations; treatment strategies should focus on long-term remission and improvement of quality of life. There is no standardized process of diagnosing, predicting prognosis, and treating the disease. This narrative review was based on a literature search using PubMed, Embase, and Science Direct. Data on unmet challenges in patients with Crohn's disease were extracted from identified manuscripts. The aim was to discuss present research on standardized processes in the management of patients with Crohn's disease and to identify the unmet needs in clinical evaluation and treatment approaches. There is no consensus on standardized diagnostic, treatment, and surveillance algorithms, particularly in assessing complications of Crohn's, such as stricturing disease, intestinal cancer risk, and cutaneous manifestations. Complications and treatment failure rates of conventional, interventional, and surgical therapy place emphasis on the need for standardized treatment algorithms, particularly in the case of acute complications of the disease. Research on standardized clinical approaches, reliable biomarkers for disease diagnosis and therapy monitoring, and new treatment agents is necessary to improve therapy and reduce complications in patients with Crohn's disease.

  Title: Crohn's Disease Prediction Using Sequence Based Machine Learning Analysis of Human Microbiome.
  Keywords: Machine Learning; bioinformatics; bowel disease; microbiota
  PMID: 37685376
  Abstract: Human microbiota refers to the trillions of microorganisms that inhabit our bodies and have been discovered to have a substantial impact on human health and disease. By sampling the microbiota, it is possible to generate massive quantities of data for analysis using Machine Learning algorithms. In this study, we employed several modern Machine Learning techniques to predict Inflammatory Bowel Disease using raw sequence data. The dataset was obtained from NCBI preprocessed graph representations and converted into a structured form. Seven well-known Machine Learning frameworks, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbor, were used. Grid Search was employed for hyperparameter optimization. The performance of the Machine Learning models was evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, fscore, kappa, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Additionally, Mc Nemar's test was conducted to assess the statistical significance of the experiment. The data was constructed using k-mer lengths of 3, 4 and 5. The Light Gradient Boosting Machine model overperformed over other models with 67.24%, 74.63% and 76.47% accuracy for k-mer lengths of 3, 4 and 5, respectively. The LightGBM model also demonstrated the best performance in each metric. The study showed promising results predicting disease from raw sequence data. Finally, Mc Nemar's test results found statistically significant differences between different Machine Learning approaches.

  Title: Vitamin D Deficiency (VDD) and Benefits of Supplementation in Veterans with IBS-D.
  Keywords: Body Mass Index (BMI); C-reactive protein (CRP); Gulf War veteran (GWV); Gulf War veterans (GWVs); diarrhea; gastrointestinal (GI); irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D); post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); traumatic brain injury (TBI); vitamin D deficiency (VDD)
  PMID: 37685345
  Abstract: Many veterans deployed to Gulf War areas suffer from persistent chronic diarrhea that is disabling and affects their quality of life. The causes for this condition have eluded investigators until recently and recent literature has shed light on the effect of vitamin D on the brain-gut axis. This study focused on determining clinical causes contributing to diarrhea and assessed whether reversing the identified causes, specifically vitamin D deficiency (VDD), could reduce the incidence of diarrhea in Gulf War veterans (GWVs). All patients completed a workup that included serologies (IBD, celiac), routine laboratory tests (CBC, chemistry panels, TSH, T4, CRP), cultures for enteric pathogens (C diff, bacteria, viruses, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)), and upper and lower endoscopies with histology and a trial of cholestyramine to exclude choleretic diarrhea and rifaximin for dysbiosis. A total of 4221 veterans were screened for chronic diarrhea, yielding 105 GWVs, of which 69 GWVs had irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D). Paired t-tests demonstrated that all GWVs had VDD (t-11.62, df68 and sig(2-tailed) 0.0001) (defined as a vitamin D level less than 30 ng/mL with normal ranges of 30-100 ng/mL) but no positive serologies, inflammatory markers, abnormal endoscopies, cultures, or histology to explain their persistent diarrhea. There was no correlation with age, BMI, or inflammation. Some zip codes had a higher frequency of GWVs with VDD, but the number of deployments had no impact. Treatment with vitamin D supplementation (3000-5000 units), given in the morning, based on weight, reduced the number of bowel movements per day (p < 0.0001) without causing hypercalcemia. We suggest that VDD is important in the etiology of IBS-D in GWVs and that vitamin D supplementation significantly reduces diarrhea.

  Title: Precision Medicine in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Keywords: Crohn’s disease (CD); artificial intelligence (AI); inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); precision medicine (PM); ulcerative colitis (UC)
  PMID: 37685335
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are traditionally defined as the two main subtypes of inflammatory bowel disease. However, a more recent view considers IBD as a spectrum of heterogeneous phenotypes with consistent differences in clinical presentation and behaviors, likely explained by differences in underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. The etiology is still elusive, and the suggested pathogenesis is a complex interplay among genetic predisposition and abnormal immune response at the mucosal intestinal level, activated by only partially identified environmental triggers leading to altered intestinal permeability and impaired handling of gut microbiota. The undeniable continuous progress of medical therapy with more frequent shifts from traditional to more advanced modalities also underlines the actual unmet needs. We are using medications with completely different mechanisms of action, with a lack of predictive factors of outcomes and response and still an unsatisfactory rate of success. In addition, we are missing still valuable and accurate markers to predict disease progression and severity in order to avoid under- or over-treatment. In such a complex scenario, it is undoubtful that the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms may improve the management and pave the way for precision and eventually personalized medicine in these patients; however, there are still several challenges that will be the focus of this review.

  Title: Evaluation of a Standardized Extract Obtained from Cashew Apple (Anacardium occidentale L.) Bagasse in DSS-Induced Mouse Colitis.
  Keywords: Anacardium occidentale L.; anacardic acids; carotenoids; colitis; food by-products; inflammatory bowel diseases
  PMID: 37685250
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) include Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Several studies relate eating habits to different aspects of IBD, such as progression and worsening of the clinical condition. Therefore, many natural products (NPs) such as polyphenols and carotenoids have been identified as promising agents in supporting IBD. An interesting source for obtaining bioactive NPs is the by-products of the food industry. The present study evaluated the potential beneficial effect of a standardized extract (CAE) obtained from cashew apple bagasse in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis model in mice. This was the first time that CAE had been evaluated in this experimental model. Chemical evaluation of CAE identified carotenoids (96.28 ± 0.15 mg/100 g), phenolic compounds (37.49 ± 0.64 mg/100 g), and a mixture of anacardic acids (C15:3 = 94.2 ± 0.6 mg/100 g; C15:2 = 108.4 ± 0.1 mg/100 g; C15:1 = 214.8 ± 0.2 mg/100 g). Administration of CAE (500 mg/kg, 4 days, p.o.) after DSS challenge was more effective in delaying disease progression compared with prior treatment (500 mg/kg, 30 days, p.o.), according to the disease activity index. However, no treatment strategy with CAE was able to prevent or inhibit disease progression, since all parameters evaluated (macroscopic, biochemical, and histopathological) in CAE-treated animals were similar to those observed in DSS-challenged animals. Despite the high dose (500 mg/kg), the standardized extract (CAE) did not result in an effective concentration of carotenoids. Furthermore, as some anacardic acids have been reported as histone acetyltransferases inhibitors, there could be a possible antagonistic relationship between carotenoids and anacardic acids. Complementary research will be necessary to test the hypothesis of antagonism. Thus, an optimized extract, with an even higher concentration of carotenoids, obtained from cashew apple bagasse, can be developed as a possible adjuvant food supplement for inflammatory bowel diseases.

  Title: Fecal Concentrations of Long-Chain Fatty Acids, Sterols, and Unconjugated Bile Acids in Cats with Chronic Enteropathy.
  Keywords: chronic inflammatory enteropathy; fecal metabolome; inflammatory bowel disease; lipid metabolism; low-grade intestinal T-cell lymphoma; small cell lymphoma
  PMID: 37685017
  Abstract: Chronic enteropathy (CE) in cats encompasses food-responsive enteropathy, chronic inflammatory enteropathy (or inflammatory bowel disease), and low-grade intestinal T-cell lymphoma. While alterations in the gut metabolome have been extensively studied in humans and dogs with gastrointestinal disorders, little is known about the specific metabolic profile of cats with CE. As lipids take part in energy storage, inflammation, and cellular structure, investigating the lipid profile in cats with CE is crucial. This study aimed to measure fecal concentrations of various fatty acids, sterols, and bile acids. Fecal samples from 56 cats with CE and 77 healthy control cats were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, targeting 12 fatty acids, 10 sterols, and 5 unconjugated bile acids. Fecal concentrations of nine targeted fatty acids and animal-derived sterols were significantly increased in cats with CE. However, fecal concentrations of plant-derived sterols were significantly decreased in cats with CE. Additionally, an increased percentage of primary bile acids was observed in a subset of cats with CE. These findings suggest the presence of lipid maldigestion, malabsorption, and inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract of cats with CE. Understanding the lipid alterations in cats with CE can provide insights into the disease mechanisms and potential future therapeutic strategies.

  Title: Selenobaculum gbiensis gen. nov. sp. nov., a new bacterium isolated from the gut microbiota of a patient with Crohn's disease.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37684335
  Abstract: The human gut microbiota is a complex ecology comprising approximately 10 to 100 trillion microbial cells. Most of the bacteria detected by 16s rRNA sequencing have yet to be cultured, but intensive attempts to isolate the novel bacteria have improved our knowledge of the gut microbiome composition and its roles within human host. In our culturomics study, a novel gram-negative, motile, obligately anaerobic, rod-shaped bacteria, designated as strain ICN-92133T, was isolated from a fecal sample of a 26-year-old patient with Crohn's disease. Based on the 16s rRNA sequence of strain ICN-92133T, the phylogeny analysis placed the strain into the family Selenomonadaceae, showing 93.91% similarity with the closely related Massilibacillus massiliensis strain DSM 102838T. Strain ICN-92133T exhibited a genome size of 2,679,003 bp with a GC content of 35.5% which was predicted to contain 26 potential virulence factors and five antimicrobial resistance genes. In comparative genomic analysis, strain ICN-92133T showed digital DNA-DNA Hybridization and OrthoANI values lower than 21.9% and 71.9% with the closest type strains, respectively. In addition, comparing phenotypic, biochemical, and cellular fatty acids with those of closely related strains revealed the distinctiveness of strain ICN-92133T. Based on the taxonogenomic results, strain ICN-92133T is proposed as a novel species belonging to a new genus. Therefore, we suggest the name of the new genus Selenobaculum gen. nov. within the family Selenomonadaceae and strain ICN-92133T (= KCTC 25622T = JCM 36070T) as a type strain of new species Selenobaculum gbiensis sp. nov.© 2023.

  Title: The association between Helicobacter pylori infection and inflammatory bowel disease in children: A systematic review with meta-analysis.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37682136
  Abstract: Available literature has reported the association of Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in adults. However, only a few studies have addressed the disease in children.To ascertain the correlation of H pylori infection with IBD among children.The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the association between H pylori infection and IBD in children. We searched databases including Cochrane, EMBASE, Google Scholar, PubMed, Medline, and Web of Science to select relevant studies. Ultimately, based on predetermined inclusion criteria, we included 6 studies that met the requirements. Review Manager and Stata software were used to extract and analyze the data from the relevant studies. In the methods, we employed both qualitative and quantitative approaches for comprehensive analysis. Qualitative analysis involved describing study designs, sample characteristics, and results, while quantitative analysis involved statistical tests such as calculating pooled risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals to evaluate the association between H pylori infection and IBD in children. Lastly, by combining the results of the individual studies, our objective is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between H pylori infection and IBD in children.In totality, we involved 2236 participants that were recruited in 6 studies. We detected no significant difference in H pylori prevalence (9.8% vs 12.7%, P = .12) by comparing the children IBD group to controls. Among the IBD children, we estimated odds ratio (OR) of H pylori infection to 0.62 [(95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.34-1.12)]. In children suffering from ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD), the H pylori infection rates were higher than in those with IBD-unclassified (IBDU).When analyzed stratified by disease of study design, In CD group [OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 0.72-2.80)] (I2 = 0%, P = .64). but no significant difference in CD group.No correlation was found between H pylori infection and the occurrence of IBD in children.Copyright © 2023 the Author(s).

  Title: Efficacy and Safety of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy in Fistulizing Crohn's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37682003
  Abstract: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) delivers 100% oxygen in a pressurized chamber, increasing tissue oxygen levels and regulating inflammatory pathways. Mounting evidence suggests that HBOT may be effective for inflammatory bowel disease. Our systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify the efficacy and safety of HBOT in fistulizing Crohn's disease (CD).A systematic review was conducted using the EMBASE, Web of Science, Pubmed, and Cochrane Library databases according to the "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses" criteria. Study bias was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook guidelines.Sixteen studies with 164 patients were included in the analysis. For all fistula subtypes, the pooled overall clinical response was 87% (95% CI: 0.70-0.95, I2 = 0) and the pooled clinical remission was 59% (95% CI: 0.35-0.80, I2 = 0). The overall clinical response was 89%, 84%, and 29% for perianal, enterocutaneous, and rectovaginal fistulas, respectively. On meta-regression, hours in the chamber and the number of HBOT sessions were not found to correlate with clinical response. The pooled number of adverse events was low at 51.7 per 10,000 HBOT sessions for all fistula types (95% CI: 16.8-159.3, I2 = 0). The risk of bias was observed across all studies.HBOT is a safe and potentially effective treatment option for fistulizing CD. Randomized control trials are needed to substantiate the benefit of HBOT in fistulizing CD.Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

  Title: miR-369-3p Modulates Intestinal Inflammatory Response via BRCC3/NLRP3 Inflammasome Axis.
  Keywords: BRCC3; NLRP3; inflammasome; miR-369-3p; microRNA
  PMID: 37681916
  Abstract: Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes expressed by immune cells in response to distinct stimuli that trigger inflammatory responses and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Evidence suggests a different role of inflammasome NLRP3 in IBD. NLRP3 inflammasome activation can be controlled by post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination through BRCC3. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of miR-369-3p on the expression and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes via BRCC3 regulation. After bioinformatics prediction of Brcc3 as a gene target of miR-369-3p, in vitro, we validated its modulation in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). The increase in miR-369-3p significantly reduced BRCC3 gene and protein expression. This modulation, in turn, reduced the expression of NLRP3 and blocked the recruitment of ASC adaptor protein by NLRP3. As a result, miR-369-3p reduced the activity of Caspase-1 by the inflammasome, decreasing the cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18. These results support a novel mechanism that seems to act on post-translational modification of NLRP3 inflammasome activation by BRCC3. This may be an interesting new target in the personalized treatment of inflammatory disorders, including IBD.

  Title: Atypical Immunoglobulin A Vasculitis in a Pediatric Patient With Ulcerative Colitis.
  Keywords: IgAV; immunoglobulin A vasculitis; pediatric; ulcerative colitis; vasculitis
  PMID: 37681212
  Abstract: Rates of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease and biologic therapy use continue to rise. Consequently, specialists and generalists should recognize potential complications and side effects. We report the unique case of an adolescent with ulcerative colitis (UC) on vedolizumab presenting with severe abdominal pain, hematochezia, and subsequent purpura. After extensive investigation and a complex clinical course, diagnosis of atypical immunoglobulin A vasculitis was made. This is the first pediatric case of vasculitis in a patient with UC on vedolizumab and only the second reported case overall in UC. This case illustrates the emerging diagnostic challenge of distinguishing inflammatory bowel disease treatment complications from other common pediatric conditions.© 2023 The Author(s).

  Title: The lung-gut crosstalk in respiratory and inflammatory bowel disease.
  Keywords: common mucosal immune system; inflammatory bowel disease; lung-gut crosstalk; microbiota; respiratory disease
  PMID: 37680747
  Abstract: Both lung and gut belong to the common mucosal immune system (CMIS), with huge surface areas exposed to the external environment. They are the main defense organs against the invasion of pathogens and play a key role in innate and adaptive immunity. Recently, more and more evidence showed that stimulation of one organ can affect the other, as exemplified by intestinal complications during respiratory disease and vice versa, which is called lung-gut crosstalk. Intestinal microbiota plays an important role in respiratory and intestinal diseases. It is known that intestinal microbial imbalance is related to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), this imbalance could impact the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier and leads to the persistence of inflammation, however, gut microbial disturbances have also been observed in respiratory diseases such as asthma, allergy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and respiratory infection. It is not fully clarified how these disorders happened. In this review, we summarized the latest examples and possible mechanisms of lung-gut crosstalk in respiratory disease and IBD and discussed the strategy of shaping intestinal flora to treat respiratory diseases.Copyright © 2023 Du, Fu, Han, Sun, Xu, Yang and Rong.

  Title: Major adverse cardiovascular events in patients treated with oral Janus kinase inhibitors for atopic dermatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
  Abstract: On the basis of safety data on patients with inflammatory rheumatism or inflammatory bowel disease, treatment with Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors has been linked to the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). However, these inflammatory diseases are pro-atherogenic; in contrast, patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) do not usually have a high cardiovascular (CV) comorbidity burden.We systematically searched the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar databases from their inception to September 2nd, 2022. Cohort studies, randomized controlled trials and pooled safety analyses providing CV safety data on patients taking JAK inhibitors for AD were selected. We included patients aged 12 and over. We built a "controlled-period" cohort (9,309 patients: 6,000 exposed to JAK inhibitors and 3,309 exposed to comparators) and an "all JAK inhibitors" cohort (9,118 patients exposed to a JAK inhibitor in any of the included studies). The primary outcome was a composite of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), ischemic stroke, and CV death. The broader secondary MACE outcome encompassed ACS, stroke (whether ischemic or hemorrhagic), transient ischemic attack, and CV death. The frequency of primary and secondary MACEs was assessed in both cohorts. A fixed-effects meta-analysis using Peto's method was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] for MACEs in the "controlled-period" cohort. Risk of bias evaluation was made using the Cochrane Risk of bias tool version 2. Certainty of evidence used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.Eight percent of the initially identified records met the selection criteria, corresponding to 23 records included in the "all JAK inhibitors" cohort". The patients had been exposed to baricitinib, upadacitinib, abrocitinib, ivarmacitinib, placebo or dupilumab. Four primary events (3 with JAK inhibitors and 1 with placebo) and 5 secondary events (4 with JAK inhibitors and 1 with placebo) occurred among 9,309 patients in the "controlled-period" cohort (MACE frequency = 0.04 % and 0.05%, respectively). Eight primary events and 13 secondary events occurred among 9,118 patients in the "all JAK inhibitors" cohort (MACE frequency = 0.08 and 0.14 %, respectively). Odds ratio for primary MACEs in patients with AD treated with JAK inhibitors compared to placebo or dupilumab was 1.35 (95% CI 0.15-12.21; I2, 12%, very low certainty of evidence).Our review highlighted rare cases of MACE among JAK inhibitors users for AD. Janus kinase inhibitors may have little to no effect on the occurrence of MACEs in patients with AD compared to comparators but the evidence is very uncertain. Real-life, long-term, population-level safety studies are needed.© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford Univ

  Title: Strains of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and its extracts reduce blood glucose levels, percent HbA1c, and improve glucose tolerance without causing hypoglycemic side effects in diabetic and prediabetic mice.
  Abstract: The commensal bacterium Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is a prominent member of the microbiome of animals and humans, and it plays an important role in several physiological processes. Numerous studies have correlated the reduction of F. prausnitzii abundance with many disease states, including irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, obesity, asthma, major depressive disorder, and metabolic diseases in humans. Studies have also correlated F. prausnitzii with diseases in humans involved in altered glucose metabolism, including diabetes.The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of compositions derived from three strains of F. prausnitzii (coined FPZ) on glucose metabolism in diet-induced obese male C57BL/6J prediabetic and type 2 diabetic mice. The primary endpoints of these studies were measuring changes in fasting blood glucose, glucose tolerance (as measured by a glucose tolerance test), and percent hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) with longer term treatment. Two placebo-controlled trials were carried out using both live cell FPZ and killed cell FPZ and extracts. Two additional placebo-controlled trials were carried out in non-diabetic mice and mice that previously had type 2 diabetes (T2D).Both trials in prediabetic and diabetic mice revealed that peroral administration of live FPZ or extracts from FPZ lowered fasting blood glucose levels and improved glucose tolerance compared with control mice. A trial administering longer FPZ treatment also resulted in lowered percent HbA1c compared with control mice. Additionally, trials in non-diabetic mice treated with FPZ demonstrated that FPZ treatment does not lead to hypoglycemia.The trial results have shown that treatment with different formulations of FPZ result in lower blood glucose levels, lower percent HbA1c, and improved glucose response in mice compared with control prediabetic/diabetic mice. FPZ is a promising candidate as an orally administered probiotic or postbiotic to manage and improve pre-diabetes and T2D.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

  Title: The significance of PD-1/PD-L1 imbalance in ulcerative colitis.
  Abstract: To investigate the expression and significance of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) in the mucosal tissues and peripheral blood of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC).Eighty patients with UC were recruited from January 2021 to August 2022 from the Shanxi Province People's Hospital. PD-1 and PD-L1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in mucosal tissues. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure soluble PD-1 and PD-L1 levels in peripheral blood serum, and the membrane-bound forms of PD-1 (mPD-1), (T-helper cell) Th1 and Th17, in peripheral blood were determined by flow cytometry.PD-1 expression was observed only in the monocytes of the mucosal lamina propria of UC patients, while PD-L1 was mainly located in both epithelial cells and monocytes on the cell membrane. The expression level of PD-1/PD-L1 in the monocytes and epithelial cells of mucosal lamina propria increased with disease activity (P < 0.05). The percentages of PD-1/T and PD-1/CD4+T in the peripheral blood of moderate UC patients (PD-1/T 12.83 ± 6.15% and PD-1/CD4+T 19.67 ± 9.95%) and severe UC patients (PD-1/T 14.29 ± 5.71% and PD-1/CD4+T 21.63 ± 11.44%) were higher than in mild UC patients (PD-1/T 8.17 ± 2.80% and PD-1/CD4+T 12.44 ± 4.73%; P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in PD-1/CD8+T cells between mild and severe UC patients (P > 0.05). There was a statistically significant difference in the expression level of sPD-L1 between the UC groups and healthy controls, and the expression level of sPD-L1 increased with disease severity (P < 0.05); however, there was no statistically significant difference in sPD-1 expression levels between the UC groups and healthy controls (P > 0.05). The correlation coefficients between Th1 and sPD-L1, PD-1/T, PD-1/CD4+T and PD-1/CD8+T were 0.427, 0.589, 0.486, and 0.329, respectively (P < 0.001). The correlation coefficients between Th17 and sPD-L1, PD-1/T, PD-1/CD4+T and PD-1/CD8+T were 0.323, 0.452, 0.320, and 0.250, respectively (P < 0.05).The expression level of PD-1/PD-L1 was correlated with UC disease activity, and two forms of PD-1 and PD-L1 may be used as a potential marker for predicting UC and assessing disease progression in UC patients. PD-1/PD-L1 imbalance was a significant phenomenon of UC immune dysfunction. Future research should focus on two forms of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling molecules to better understand the pathogenesis of UC and to identify potential drug therapies.© 2023 Shi et al.

  Title: The expression IL1B correlates negatively with the clinical response to adalimumab in Crohn's disease patients: An ex vivo approach using peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
  Abstract: Understanding of the molecular mechanisms of anti-TNFα therapy non-response and reliable biomarkers are essential for personalized medicine in Crohn's disease (CD) patients. Using RNA-seq data adjusted for deconvoluted fractions of peripheral blood cells, we recently described MMD gene, coding for a monocyte to macrophage differentiation factor, as a biomarker of adalimumab (anti-TNFα) therapy response in CD. The results also suggest that cell subtype-specific biomarkers may be superior to those measured in bulk peripheral blood. Here, we used functional cell model to further investigate the role of the monocyte to macrophage differentiation in adalimumab treatment response and evaluate monocyte/macrophage specific expression of the inflammatory cytokines as potential biomarkers for (non)response to adalimumab in CD patients.The peripheral monocytes of CD patients responsive and non-responsive to adalimumab were isolated, differentiated into macrophages, and exposed to inflammation and concurrent adalimumab therapy in vitro. The results were correlated to the clinical response of the donor patients.Correlation is shown of the expression of two macrophage differentiation related genes- CD68 and MMD, with the expression of the inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL1B, IL6 and CXCL8. Monocytes and in vitro differentiated macrophages of adalimumab non-responders express more inflammatory cytokines than those of responders. The biggest difference was in the IL1B expression. Additionally, IL1B expression in the in vitro differentiated macrophages of CD patients correlates negatively with their clinical response to adalimumab.We propose the IL1B expression in the macrophages as a possible biomarker for adalimumab response in CD patients.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

  Title: Gene expression profiling in white blood cells reveals new insights into the molecular mechanisms of thalidomide in children with inflammatory bowel disease.
  Abstract: Thalidomide has emerged as an effective immunomodulator in the treatment of pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refractory to standard therapies. Cereblon (CRBN), a component of E3 protein ligase complex that mediates ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of target proteins, has been identified as the primary target of thalidomide. CRBN plays a crucial role in thalidomide teratogenicity, however it is unclear whether it is also involved in the therapeutic effects in IBD patients. This study aimed at identifying the molecular mechanisms underpinning thalidomide action in pediatric IBD. In this study, ten IBD pediatric patients responsive to thalidomide were prospectively enrolled. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis and functional enrichment analysis were carried out on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained before and after twelve weeks of treatment with thalidomide. RNA-seq analysis revealed 378 differentially expressed genes before and after treatment with thalidomide. The most deregulated pathways were cytosolic calcium ion concentration, cAMP-mediated signaling, eicosanoid signaling and inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases. Neuronal signaling mechanisms such as CREB signaling in neurons and axonal guidance signaling also emerged. Connectivity Map analysis revealed that thalidomide gene expression changes were similar to those exposed to MLN4924, an inhibitor of NEDD8 activating enzyme, suggesting that thalidomide exerts its immunomodulatory effects by acting on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In vitro experiments on cell lines confirmed the effect of thalidomide on candidate altered pathways observed in patients. These results represent a unique resource for enhanced understanding of thalidomide mechanism in pediatric patients with IBD, providing novel potential targets associated with drug response.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

  Title: Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions
  Abstract: Hypersensitivity reactions (HR) are immune responses that are exaggerated or inappropriate against an antigen or allergen. Coombs and Gell classified hypersensitivity reactions into four forms. Type I, type II, and type III hypersensitivity reactions are known as immediate hypersensitivity reactions (IHR) because they occur within 24 hours. Antibodies including IgE, IgM, and IgG mediate them. Type I or Anaphylactic Response The anaphylactic response is mediated by IgE antibodies that are produced by the immune system in response to environmental proteins (allergens) such as pollens, animal danders, or dust mites. These antibodies (IgE) bind to mast cells and basophils, which contain histamine granules that are released in the reaction and cause inflammation. Type I hypersensitivity reactions can be seen in bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic dermatitis, food allergy, allergic conjunctivitis, and anaphylactic shock. Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency as it can lead to acute, life-threatening respiratory failure. It is an IgE-mediated process. It is the most severe form of an allergic reaction, where mast cells suddenly release a large amount of histamine and later on leukotrienes. In severe cases intense bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, cyanosis, hypotension, and shock are present.  Allergic Bronchial Asthma Allergic bronchial asthma is an atopic disease, characterized by bronchospasm. It may also be a chronic inflammatory disease. In its etiology, environmental factors along with a genetic background play an important role. The diagnosis is dependent on history and examination. In allergic bronchial asthma, IgE is elevated, and sputum eosinophilia is common. Epidemiologically, a positive skin prick test or specific IgE are risk factors for asthma. Allergic Rhinitis Allergic rhinitis is another atopic disease where histamine and leukotrienes are responsible for rhinorrhea, sneezing, and nasal obstruction. Allergens are similar to those found in bronchial asthma. Nasal polyps may be seen in chronic rhinitis. Allergic Conjunctivitis Allergic conjunctivitis presents with rhinitis and is IgE-mediated. Itching and eye problems including watering, redness, and swelling always occur.

  Title: Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions
  Abstract: Hypersensitivity reactions (HR) are immune responses that are exaggerated or inappropriate against an antigen or allergen. Coombs and Gell classified hypersensitivity reactions into four forms. Type I, type II, and type III hypersensitivity reactions are known as immediate hypersensitivity reactions (IHR) because they occur within 24 hours. Antibodies including IgE, IgM, and IgG mediate them. Type I or Anaphylactic Response The anaphylactic response is mediated by IgE antibodies that are produced by the immune system in response to environmental proteins (allergens) such as pollens, animal danders, or dust mites. These antibodies (IgE) bind to mast cells and basophils, which contain histamine granules that are released in the reaction and cause inflammation. Type I hypersensitivity reactions can be seen in bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic dermatitis, food allergy, allergic conjunctivitis, and anaphylactic shock. Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency as it can lead to acute, life-threatening respiratory failure. It is an IgE-mediated process. It is the most severe form of an allergic reaction, where mast cells suddenly release a large amount of histamine and later on leukotrienes. In severe cases intense bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, cyanosis, hypotension, and shock are present.  Allergic Bronchial Asthma Allergic bronchial asthma is an atopic disease, characterized by bronchospasm. It may also be a chronic inflammatory disease. In its etiology, environmental factors along with a genetic background play an important role. The diagnosis is dependent on history and examination. In allergic bronchial asthma, IgE is elevated, and sputum eosinophilia is common. Epidemiologically, a positive skin prick test or specific IgE are risk factors for asthma. Allergic Rhinitis Allergic rhinitis is another atopic disease where histamine and leukotrienes are responsible for rhinorrhea, sneezing, and nasal obstruction. Allergens are similar to those found in bronchial asthma. Nasal polyps may be seen in chronic rhinitis. Allergic Conjunctivitis Allergic conjunctivitis presents with rhinitis and is IgE-mediated. Itching and eye problems including watering, redness, and swelling always occur. Food Allergy Clinicians must differentiate food allergy (IgE-mediated) from food intolerance that can be a cause for a variety of etiologies including malabsorption and celiac disease. It is more frequent in children as seen in cow's milk allergy. Food allergy symptoms mostly affect the respiratory tract, the skin, and the gut.

  Title: Validation Study of Novel Point-of-Care Tests for Infliximab, Adalimumab and C-Reactive Protein in Capillary Blood and Calprotectin in Faeces in an Ambulatory Inflammatory Bowel Disease Care Setting.
  Abstract: Background and aims: Point-of-care tests (POCT) allow instant measurement of inflammatory markers and drug concentrations. Here, we studied agreement between a novel POCT device and reference methods of measuring infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADL) serum concentrations and C-reactive protein (CRP) and faecal calprotectin (FCP) concentrations of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Methods: In this single-centre validation study, IBD patients were recruited in which IFX, ADL, CRP and/or FCP tests were required. IFX, ADL and CRP POCT were performed on capillary whole blood (CWB), obtained via finger prick. Additionally, IFX POCT was performed on serum samples. FCP POCT was performed on stool samples. Agreement between POCT and reference methods was tested using Passing-Bablok regression, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots. Results: In total, 285 patients participated. Passing-Bablok regression identified differences between the reference method and IFX CWB POCT (intercept = 1.56), IFX serum POCT (intercept = 0.71, slope = 1.10) and ADL CWB POCT (intercept = 1.44). There were also differences in the Passing-Bablok regressions of CRP (intercept = 0.81, slope = 0.78) and FCP (intercept = 51 and slope = 0.46). Bland-Altman plots demonstrated that IFX and ADL concentrations were slightly higher with the POCT and CRP and FCP were slightly lower with POCT. The ICC demonstrated almost perfect agreement with IFX CWB POCT (ICC = 0.85), IFX serum POCT (ICC = 0.96), ADL CWB POCT (ICC = 0.82) and CRP CWB POCT (ICC = 0.91) and moderate agreement with FCP POCT (ICC = 0.55). Conclusions: IFX and ADL results were slightly higher with this novel rapid and user-friendly POCT, whereas CRP and FCP results were slightly lower compared to the reference methods.

  Title: Oral polyphenol-armored nanomedicine for targeted modulation of gut microbiota-brain interactions in colitis.
  Abstract: Developing oral nanomedicines that suppress intestinal inflammation while modulating gut microbiota and brain interactions is essential for effectively treating inflammatory bowel disease. Here, we report an oral polyphenol-armored nanomedicine based on tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-small interfering RNA and gallic acid-mediated graphene quantum dot (GAGQD)-encapsulated bovine serum albumin nanoparticle, with a chitosan and tannin acid (CHI/TA) multilayer. Referred to "armor," the CHI/TA multilayer resists the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract and adheres to inflamed colon sites in a targeted manner. TA provides antioxidative stress and prebiotic activities that modulate the diverse gut microbiota. Moreover, GAGQD protected TNF-α-siRNA delivery. Unexpectedly, the armored nanomedicine suppressed hyperactive immune responses and modulated bacterial gut microbiota homeostasis in a mouse model of acute colitis. Notably, the armored nanomedicine alleviated anxiety- and depression-like behaviors and cognitive impairment in mice with colitis. This armor strategy sheds light on the effect of oral nanomedicines on bacterial gut microbiome-brain interactions.

  Title: Cytokine-stimulated human amniotic epithelial cells alleviate DSS-induced colitis in mice through anti-inflammation and regulating Th17/Treg balance.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon characterized by immune dysregulation. Restoration of the balance between regulatory T (Tregs) and T helper 17 (Th17) cells improves UC symptoms. Human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic option for UC because of their immunomodulatory properties. In this study, we aimed to optimize and maximize the therapeutic potential of hAECs by pre-treating them with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interferon (IFN)-γ (pre-hAECs) for UC treatment. We evaluated the efficacy of hAECs and pre-hAECs in treating dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice. Compared to hAECs, pre-hAECs were found to be more effective in alleviating colitis in acute DSS mouse models than in the controls. Additionally, pre-hAEC treatment significantly reduced weight loss, shortened the colon length, decreased the disease activity index, and effectively maintained the recovery of colon epithelial cells. Furthermore, pre-hAEC treatment significantly inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1β and TNF-α, and promoted the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10. Both in vivo and in vitro studies revealed that pre-treatment with hAECs significantly increased the number of Treg cells, decreased the numbers of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells, and regulated the balance of Th17/Treg cells. In conclusion, our results revealed that hAECs pre-treated with TNF-α and IFN-γ were highly effective in treating UC, suggesting their potential as therapeutic candidates for UC immunotherapy.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

  Title: THE EVALUATION OF INFLIXIMAB TROUGH LEVEL FAVORS MAINTENANCE THERAPY OF PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE.
  Abstract: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic diseases that result from the deregulation of the mucosal immune system of the gastrointestinal tract. The use of biological therapies, including infliximab (IFX), is one of the strategies to treat both CD and UC. The IFX treatment is monitored by complementary tests, namely: fecal calprotectin (FC); C-reactive protein (CRP); and endoscopic and cross-sectional imaging. Besides, serum IFX evaluation and antibody detection are also used.To evaluate trough levels (TL) and antibodies in a population with inflammatory bowel (IBD) disease undergoing treatment with IFX, and the factors that might impact the treatment effectiveness.Retrospective, cross-sectional study with patients with IBD that were assessed for TL and antibody (ATI) levels in a southern Brazilian hospital, from June 2014 to July 2016.The study assessed 55 patients (52.7% female) submitted to serum IFX and antibody evaluations (95 blood samples, 55 first test; 30 second test, and 10 as third testing. Forty-five (47.3%) cases were diagnosed with CD (81.8%), and ten with UC (18.2%). Serum levels were adequate in 30 samples (31.57%), subtherapeutic in 41 (43.15%), and supratherapeutic in 24 (25.26%). IFX dosages were optimized for 40 patients (42.10%), maintained for 31 (32.63%), and discontinued for 7 (7.60%). The intervals between infusions were shortened in 17.85% of the cases. In 55 tests (55.79%), the therapeutic approach was exclusively defined according to IFX and/or serum antibody levels. The assessment of patients one year later indicated that: the approach was maintained with IFX for thirty-eight patients (69.09%); the class of biological agent was changed for eight (14.54%); changes using the same class of biological agent occurred for two patients (3.63%); the medication was discontinued and not replaced for three patients (5.45%), and four patients (7.27%) were lost to follow-up.There were no differences in TL between groups with or without immunosuppressants, serum albumin (ALB), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), FC, CRP, and endoscopic and imaging examinations. Current therapeutic approach could be maintained for almost 70% of patients. Thus, serum and antibody levels are a useful tool in the follow-up of patients undergoing maintenance therapy and after treatment induction in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

Besides, serum IFX evaluation and antibody detection are also used.To evaluate trough levels (TL) and antibodies in a population with inflammatory bowel (IBD) disease undergoing treatment with IFX, and the factors that might impact the treatment effectiveness.Retrospective, cross-sectional study with patients with IBD that were assessed for TL and antibody (ATI) levels in a southern Brazilian hospital, from June 2014 to July 2016.The study assessed 55 patients (52.7% female) submitted to serum IFX and antibody evaluations (95 blood samples, 55 first test; 30 second test, and 10 as third testing. Forty-five (47.3%) cases were diagnosed with CD (81.8%), and ten with UC (18.2%). Serum levels were adequate in 30 samples (31.57%), subtherapeutic in 41 (43.15%), and supratherapeutic in 24 (25.26%). IFX dosages were optimized for 40 patients (42.10%), maintained for 31 (32.63%), and discontinued for 7 (7.60%). The intervals between infusions were shortened in 17.85% of the cases. In 55 tests (55.79%), the therapeutic approach was exclusively defined according to IFX and/or serum antibody levels. The assessment of patients one year later indicated that: the approach was maintained with IFX for thirty-eight patients (69.09%); the class of biological agent was changed for eight (14.54%); changes using the same class of biological agent occurred for two patients (3.63%); the medication was discontinued and not replaced for three patients (5.45%), and four patients (7.27%) were lost to follow-up.There were no differences in TL between groups with or without immunosuppressants, serum albumin (ALB), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), FC, CRP, and endoscopic and imaging examinations. Current therapeutic approach could be maintained for almost 70% of patients. Thus, serum and antibody levels are a useful tool in the follow-up of patients undergoing maintenance therapy and after treatment induction in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

  Title: Repurposing Sulfasalazine as a Radiosensitizer in Hypoxic Human Colorectal Cancer.
  Abstract: xCT overexpression in cancer cells has been linked to tumor growth, metastasis and treatment resistance. Sulfasalazine (SSZ), an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of rheumatoid sarthritis, and inflammatory bowel diseases, has anticancer properties via inhibition of xCT, leading to the disruption of redox homeostasis. Since reactive oxygen species (ROS) are pivotal for the efficacy of radiotherapy (RT), elevated levels of ROS are associated with improved RT outcomes. In this study, the influence of SSZ treatment on the radiosensitivity of human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells was investigated. Our principal finding in human HCT116 and DLD-1 cells was that SSZ enhances the radiosensitivity of hypoxic CRC cells but does not alter the intrinsic radiosensitivity. The radiosensitizing effect was attributed to the depletion of glutathione and thioredoxin reductase levels. In turn, the reduction leads to excessive levels of ROS, increased DNA damage, and ferroptosis induction. Confirmation of these findings was performed in 3D models and in DLD-1 xenografts. Taken together, this study is a stepping stone for applying SSZ as a radiosensitizer in the clinic and confirms that xCT in cancer cells is a valid radiobiological target.

  Title: PR1P, a VEGF-stabilizing peptide, reduces injury and inflammation in acute lung injury and ulcerative colitis animal models.
  Abstract: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC) are each characterized by tissue damage and uncontrolled inflammation. Neutrophils and other inflammatory cells play a primary role in disease progression by acutely responding to direct and indirect insults to tissue injury and by promoting inflammation through secretion of inflammatory cytokines and proteases. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is a ubiquitous signaling molecule that plays a key role in maintaining and promoting cell and tissue health, and is dysregulated in both ARDS and UC. Recent evidence suggests a role for VEGF in mediating inflammation, however, the molecular mechanism by which this occurs is not well understood. We recently showed that PR1P, a 12-amino acid peptide that binds to and upregulates VEGF, stabilizes VEGF from degradation by inflammatory proteases such as elastase and plasmin thereby limiting the production of VEGF degradation products (fragmented VEGF (fVEGF)). Here we show that fVEGF is a neutrophil chemoattractant in vitro and that PR1P can be used to reduce neutrophil migration in vitro by preventing the production of fVEGF during VEGF proteolysis. In addition, inhaled PR1P reduced neutrophil migration into airways following injury in three separate murine acute lung injury models including from lipopolysaccharide (LPS), bleomycin and acid. Reduced presence of neutrophils in the airways was associated with decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines (including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) and Myeloperoxidase (MPO) in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Finally, PR1P prevented weight loss and tissue injury and reduced plasma levels of key inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6 in a rat TNBS-induced colitis model. Taken together, our data demonstrate that VEGF and fVEGF may each play separate and pivotal roles in mediating inflammation in ARDS and UC, and that PR1P, by preventing proteolytic degradation of VEGF and the production of fVEGF may represent a novel therapeutic approach to preserve VEGF signaling and inhibit inflammation in acute and chronic inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2023 Adini, Ko, Puder, Louie, Kim, Baron and Matthews.

  Title: Discovery of pyrimidine-5-carboxamide derivatives as novel salt-inducible kinases (SIKs) inhibitors for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment.
  Abstract: Salt-inducible kinases (SIKs) play a crucial role in inflammation process, acting as molecular switches that regulate the transformation of M1/M2 macrophages. HG-9-91-01 is a SIKs inhibitor with potent inhibitory activity against SIKs in the nanomolar range. However, its poor drug-like properties, including a rapid elimination rate, low in vivo exposure and high plasma protein binding rate, have hindered further research and clinical application. To improve the drug-like properties of HG-9-91-01, a series of pyrimidine-5-carboxamide derivatives were designed and synthesized through a molecular hybridization strategy. The most promising compound 8h was obtained with favorable activity and selectivity on SIK1/2, excellent metabolic stability in human liver microsome, enhanced in vivo exposure and suitable plasma protein binding rate. Mechanism research showed that compound 8h significantly up-regulated the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 in bone marrow-derived macrophages. Furthermore, it significantly elevated expression of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) target genes IL-10, c-FOS and Nurr77. Compound 8h also induced the translocation of CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivator 3 (CRTC3) and elevated the expression of LIGHT, SPHK1 and Arginase 1. Additionally, compound 8h demonstrated excellent anti-inflammatory effects in a DSS-induced colitis model. Generally, this research indicated that compound 8h has the potential to be developed as an anti-inflammatory drug candidate.Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

  Title: Paris polyphylla extract attenuates colitis in mice by regulating PPAR-γ mediated Treg/Th17 balance.
  Abstract: Paris polyphylla Sm. (P.P), is a widely-used traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in the treatment of wound, throat sores and snakebites. Furthermore, P.P was recorded as an anti-inflammatory drug by the Chinese Pharmacopoeia.We sought to decipher the anti-inflammatory effect of P.P on ulcerative colitis (UC); specifically, to explore whether P.P attenuates colitis by restoring the regulatory T cells (Tregs) and T helper 17 (Th17) cells balance and its mechanism.We treated experimental colitis mice with extracts of Paris polyphylla (EPP). The percentage of Tregs and Th17 cells were measured using flow cytometry, and their secreted cytokines levels were evaluated employing ELISA. The expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) in colon tissues was detected using immunofluorescence. Furthermore, GW9662, a PPAR-γ antagonist, was used to validate the mechanism of EPP in restoring the Treg/Th17 balance.The EPP effectively alleviated the clinical symptoms and inflammatory cytokine levels in mice with colitis. EPP treatment also restored the impaired Treg/Th17 balance in mice. Furthermore, EPP treatment promoted PPAR-γ expression and reduced HIF-1α and p-STAT3 expression in colon tissues, whereas PPAR-γ inhibition blocked the effects of EPP in mice models.Our study indicates that EPP exhibit excellent anti-inflammatory properties via restoring PPAR-γ/STAT3/HIF-1α axis-mediated Treg/Th17 balance in colitis mice. Hence, P. polyphylla is a promising medicinal plant-based alternative for managing colitis that requires further clinical validation.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

  Title: Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation on Clinical Course and T Helper 17/ T-Regulatory Balance in Peripheral Blood of Patients with Crohn's Disease.
  Abstract: Vitamin D has anti-inflammatory properties and is involved in immune function, making it a potential therapy for Crohn's disease. This study aimed to investigate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on immune function and the clinical efficacy of patients with Crohn's disease.From September 2017 to September 2021, patients with Crohn's disease were recruited and randomly divided into 2 groups: the routine treatment group (n = 52) and the vitamin D supplement group (n = 50). In addition to routine treatment, the vitamin D group received oral calcitriol capsule supplementation, while the routine treatment group did not receive any additional intervention. T helper 17/T-regulatory cell level, inflammatory indicators, and nutritional status were compared between the 2 groups, as well as mucosal healing under endoscopy and the life quality of patients.C-reactive protein was significantly lower in the vitamin D treatment group compared to the routine treatment group (6.08 ± 2.72 vs. 18.91 ± 2.66, P < .05). Compared to the routine treatment group, the ratio of T helper 17/T-regulatory cells was significantly lower in the vitamin D group (0.26 ± 0.12 vs. 0.55 ± 0.11, P < .05). After vitamin D treatment, both of the average Crohn's disease activity index score (from 319.7 ± 72.7 to 179.6 ± 48.5, P < .05) and simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease score (from 7.9 ± 2.3 to 3.9 ± 0.6, P < .05) were significantly decreased, while the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire score was significantly increased (from 137.8 ± 21.2 to 158.1 ± 25.1, P < .05).Vitamin D has the potential to improve the inflammatory status and immune environment of patients with Crohn's disease, which can reduce the level of inflammatory factors and help the recovery of symptoms, thus improving the clinical course and quality of life in Crohn's disease patients.

  Title: Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation on Clinical Course and T Helper 17/ T-Regulatory Balance in Peripheral Blood of Patients with Crohn's Disease.
  Abstract: Vitamin D has anti-inflammatory properties and is involved in immune function, making it a potential therapy for Crohn's disease. This study aimed to investigate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on immune function and the clinical efficacy of patients with Crohn's disease.From September 2017 to September 2021, patients with Crohn's disease were recruited and randomly divided into 2 groups: the routine treatment group (n = 52) and the vitamin D supplement group (n = 50). In addition to routine treatment, the vitamin D group received oral calcitriol capsule supplementation, while the routine treatment group did not receive any additional intervention. T helper 17/T-regulatory cell level, inflammatory indicators, and nutritional status were compared between the 2 groups, as well as mucosal healing under endoscopy and the life quality of patients.C-reactive protein was significantly lower in the vitamin D treatment group compared to the routine treatment group (6.08 ± 2.72 vs. 18.91 ± 2.66, P < .05). Compared to the routine treatment group, the ratio of T helper 17/T-regulatory cells was significantly lower in the vitamin D group (0.26 ± 0.12 vs. 0.55 ± 0.11, P < .05). After vitamin D treatment, both of the average Crohn's disease activity index score (from 319.7 ± 72.7 to 179.6 ± 48.5, P < .05) and simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease score (from 7.9 ± 2.3 to 3.9 ± 0.6, P < .05) were significantly decreased, while the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire score was significantly increased (from 137.8 ± 21.2 to 158.1 ± 25.1, P < .05).Vitamin D has the potential to improve the inflammatory status and immune environment of patients with Crohn's disease, which can reduce the level of inflammatory factors and help the recovery of symptoms, thus improving the clinical course and quality of life in Crohn's disease patients.

  Title: Quercetin serves as the major component of Xiang-lian Pill to ameliorate ulcerative colitis via tipping the balance of STAT1/PPARγ and dictating the alternative activation of macrophage.
  Abstract: The traditional Chinese herbal formula, Xiang-lian Pill (XLP), is commonly prescribed for ulcerative colitis (UC) patients to relieve their clinical symptom. Nonetheless, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of XLP's anti-UC effect remain incompletely understood.To evaluate the therapeutic effect and elucidate the possible working mechanisms of XLP in UC treatment. The major active component of XLP was also characterized.Colitis was induced in C57BL/6 mice with 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) dissolved in drinking water for 7 consecutive days. The UC mice were grouped and treated with XLP (3640 mg/kg) or vehicle orally during the procedure of DSS induction. Mouse body weight, disease activity index (DAI) score and colon length were recorded. Histopathological changes and inflammatory cell infiltration were evaluated by pathological staining and flow cytometric analysis (FACS). Network pharmacology, bioinformatic analysis, widely targeted and targeted metabolomics analysis were performed to screen the potential effective ingredients and key targets. Bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), RAW264.7 and THP-1 cells were used to dissect the anti-inflammatory effect of XLP.Oral administration of XLP ameliorated DSS induced mouse colitis, as evidenced by reduced DAI and colonic inflammatory destruction. FACS results demonstrated that XLP treatment effectively restored immune tolerance in colon, inhibited the generation of monocyte derived macrophages and skewed macrophage polarization into M2 phenotype. Network pharmacology analysis suggested that innate effector modules related to macrophage activation comprise the major targets of XLP, and the counter-regulatory STAT1/PPARγ signaling possibly serves as the critical downstream pathway. Subsequent experiments unveiled an imbalance of STAT1/PPARγ signaling in monocytes derived from UC patients, and validated that XLP suppressed LPS/IFN-γ induced macrophage activation (STAT1 mediated) but facilitated IL-4 induced macrophage M2 polarization (PPARγ dependent). Meanwhile, our data showed that quercetin served as the major component of XLP to recapitulate the regulatory effect on macrophages.Our findings revealed that quercetin serves as the major component of XLP that regulates macrophage alternative activation via tipping the balance of STAT1/PPARγ, which provides a mechanistic explanation for the therapeutic effect of XLP in UC treatment.Copyright © 2023.

  Title: Changes in the gut mycobiome in pediatric patients in relation to the clinical activity of Crohn's disease.
  Abstract: Numerous studies have shown that in Crohn's disease (CD), the gut microbiota is of great importance in the induction and maintenance of inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Until recently, studies have focused almost exclusively on bacteria in the gut. Lately, more attention has been paid to the role of intestinal fungi.To study the gut mycobiome analysis of pediatric patients with CD (in different stages of disease activity) compared to healthy children.Fecal samples were collected from patients: With active, newly diagnosed CD (n = 50); active but previously diagnosed and treated CD (n = 16); non-active CD and who were in clinical remission (n = 39) and from healthy volunteers (n = 40). Fungal DNA was isolated from the samples. Next, next generation sequencing (MiSeq, Illumina) was performed. The composition of mycobiota was correlated with clinical and blood parameters.Candida spp. were overrepresented in CD patients, while in the control group, the most abundant genus was Saccharomyces. In CD patients, the percentage of Malassezia was almost twice that of the control (P < 0.05). In active CD patients, we documented a higher abundance of Debaryomyces hansenii (D. hansenii) compared to the non-active CD and control (P < 0.05) groups. Moreover, statistically significant changes in the abundance of Mycosphaerella, Rhodotorula, and Microidium were observed. The analyses at the species level and linear discriminant analysis showed that in each group it was possible to distinguish a specific species characteristic of a given patient population. Moreover, we have documented statistically significant correlations between: D. hansenii and patient age (negative); C. zeylanoides and patient age (positive); C. dubliniensis and calprotectin (positive); C. sake and calprotectin (positive); and C. tropicalis and pediatric CD activity index (PCDAI) (positive).Mycobiome changes in CD patients, and the positive correlation of some species with calprotectin or PCDAI, give strong evidence that fungi may be of key importance in the development of CD.©The Author(s) 2023.

  Title: Serum Interleukin 6, Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) Score and Phase Angle in Patients with Crohn's Disease.
  Abstract: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that may occur in any segment of the gastrointestinal tract. Asymptomatic or untreated inflammation along with malnutrition can often coexist in patients with CD, impairing clinical outcomes, therefore the aim of this study was to assess the relationship between inflammation, malnutrition risk and nutritional status in CD patients. Consecutive adult CD outpatients aged 18-65 years were recruited. Disease activity was clinically defined by the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), whilst anthropometry and phase angle (PhA) were measured. The Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score was retrospectively calculated for screening malnutrition risk and blood samples were taken. A total of 140 CD patients with a mean age of 38.8 ± 13.9 years and an average weight of 64.9 ± 12.0 kg were included. Serum interleukin (IL)-6 concentration was increased in active-CD patients, unrelated to medical treatment, which was associated with CDAI and PhA. Based on the CONUT score, the prevalence of patients with moderate/severe malnutrition risk (score ≥ 5) was 10%, showing lower age, body mass index and fat mass, but higher IL-6 and IL-1β levels than subjects classified as not at risk (score 0-1). Finally, increased IL-6 levels and reduced PhA values were identified as independent predictors of moderate/severe malnutrition risk (p < 0.05). In conclusion, IL-6 increased in active-CD patients, which was inversely correlated with PhA. Although the CONUT score might be helpful for identifying CD patients at moderate/severe risk of malnutrition, larger studies are needed to verify these results in different settings.

  Title: [Diosmetin regulates intestinal immune balance by inhibiting PI3K/AKT signaling to relieve 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced Crohn's disease-like colitis in mice].
  Abstract: To investigate the therapeutic mechanism of diosmetin on 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced Crohn's disease (CD)-like colitis in mice.Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were randomized into control group, TNBS-induced CD-like colitis group (TNBS group) and 50 mg·kg-1·d-1 diosmetin-treated group (n=8). Disease activity (DAI) scores, body weight changes, histological scores, colon lengths and colon mucosal levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-17A were measured to evaluate the severity of colitis. The changes of T lymphocyte subsets (Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg) in the mesenteric lymph nodes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Network pharmacology and molecular docking were used to analyze the effect of diosmetin on PI3K/AKT pathway.Compared with TNBS group, diosmetin treatment significantly lowered DAI scores, histological scores, body weight loss and colon mucosal levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-17A (P < 0.05) and increased the colon length of the rat models, but these improvements did not reach the control levels (P < 0.05). Diosmetin significantly lowered the percentages of Th1/Th17 cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes in TNBS-treated mice, which remained higher than the control levels (P < 0.05); The percentages of Th2/Treg cells were significantly higher in diosmetin group than in TNBS group (P < 0.05) and the control group (P < 0.05). Network pharmacologic analysis identified 46 intersection targets of diosmetin and CD, and among them AKT1, EGFR, SRC, ESR1, MMP9 and PTGS2 were the top 6 core targets. GO and KEGG analyses showed that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was closely related with the therapeutic effect of diosmetin on CD-like colitis. Molecular docking suggested strong binding of diosmetin to the key core targets. Diosmetin significantly reduced the levels of p-PI3K and p-AKT in the colon mucosa in TNBS-treated mice (P < 0.05), but their levels remained higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05).Diosmetin ameliorates TNBS-induced CDPlike colitis in mice possibly by regulating Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg balance to improve intestinal immune disorder through inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling.

  Title: Model-Based Investigation of Inadequate Efficacy of Tesnatilimab, an Anti-Natural Killer Group 2 Member D Monoclonal Antibody, in Moderately to Severely Active Crohn Disease.
  Abstract: Tesnatilimab is a human immunoglobulin G4 isotype monoclonal antibody that blocks the natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) receptor and prevents the downstream signaling of proinflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic mediators. Subcutaneous tesnatilimab was investigated in a phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn disease (CD). While the proof-of-concept part I of the study demonstrated significant treatment effects, part II (dose-ranging) revealed an unexpected lack of dose-response and a modest degree of clinical benefit for treatment groups. To inform further drug development, population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) modeling and exposure-response (E-R) analyses were planned and performed. A 1-compartment PopPK model with first-order absorption and parallel linear and nonlinear elimination pathways was established for tesnatilimab in patients with CD. No clinically significant covariates were identified, and overall consistent pharmacokinetics were observed between part I and part II patients. Receptor occupancy data suggested full occupancy of the peripheral blood natural killer group 2 member D receptors and target engagement at all tested dose levels. Pooled part I and part II data showed a positive efficacy E-R relationship; however, this was driven by data from part I. Part II-only analysis did not show an apparent efficacy E-R relationship. No important covariates were identified in efficacy E-R analyses, overall, and in various subpopulations. No apparent E-R relationships were observed for the investigated safety end points. The PopPK and E-R analyses indicated that the inadequate efficacy of tesnatilimab in CD was unlikely due to insufficient drug exposure and target engagement.© 2023, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology.

  Title: Model-Based Investigation of Inadequate Efficacy of Tesnatilimab, an Anti-Natural Killer Group 2 Member D Monoclonal Antibody, in Moderately to Severely Active Crohn Disease.
  Abstract: Tesnatilimab is a human immunoglobulin G4 isotype monoclonal antibody that blocks the natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) receptor and prevents the downstream signaling of proinflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic mediators. Subcutaneous tesnatilimab was investigated in a phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn disease (CD). While the proof-of-concept part I of the study demonstrated significant treatment effects, part II (dose-ranging) revealed an unexpected lack of dose-response and a modest degree of clinical benefit for treatment groups. To inform further drug development, population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) modeling and exposure-response (E-R) analyses were planned and performed. A 1-compartment PopPK model with first-order absorption and parallel linear and nonlinear elimination pathways was established for tesnatilimab in patients with CD. No clinically significant covariates were identified, and overall consistent pharmacokinetics were observed between part I and part II patients. Receptor occupancy data suggested full occupancy of the peripheral blood natural killer group 2 member D receptors and target engagement at all tested dose levels. Pooled part I and part II data showed a positive efficacy E-R relationship; however, this was driven by data from part I. Part II-only analysis did not show an apparent efficacy E-R relationship.

  Title: Cornus mas L. Extract Targets the Specific Molecules of the Th17/Treg Developmental Pathway in TNBS-Induced Experimental Colitis in Rats.
  Abstract: Given that one of the crucial events in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease is the loss of homeostasis between Th17 and Treg cells, targeting the specific molecules of the Th17/Treg axis developmental pathway is a promising strategy for inflammatory bowel disease prevention and treatment. The current study aimed to assess the impact of cornelian cherry (Cornus mas L.) extract, rich in iridoids and polyphenols known for their potential anti-inflammatory activity, at two doses (20 or 100 mg/kg) on the crucial factors for Th17/Treg cell differentiation in the course of experimental colitis and compare this action with that of sulfasalazine. This study was conducted on the biobank colon tissue samples collected during the previous original experiment, in which colitis in rats was induced by trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS). The levels of IL-6, RORγt, total STAT3, p-STAT3, and Foxp3 were determined by ELISA. The expression of PIAS3 mRNA was quantified by qPCR. Cornelian cherry extract at a dose of 100 mg/kg counteracted the TNBS-induced elevation of IL-6, RORγt, and p-STAT3 levels and a decrease in Foxp3 level and PIAS3 mRNA expression, while given concomitantly with sulfasalazine was more effective than sulfasalazine alone in reversing the TNBS-induced changes in IL-6, RORγt, total STAT3, p-STAT3, Foxp3 levels, and PIAS3 mRNA expression. The beneficial effect of cornelian cherry extract on experimental colitis may be due to its immunomodulatory activity reflected by the influence on factors regulating the Th17/Treg axis.

  Title: Weekly Folic Acid Is a Convenient and Well-Tolerated Alternative to Daily Dosing in Pediatric Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease on Methotrexate.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects the gastrointestinal tract. Methotrexate is a folate analog immunosuppressant used in the management of pediatric IBD. Daily folic acid supplementation is currently recommended to prevent folate deficiency and reduce the side effects of methotrexate such as nausea, stomatitis, and hepatotoxicity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and adequacy of once-weekly folic acid supplementation in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients taking methotrexate.In this single-arm observational study, we included subjects aged 2-21 years old with inflammatory bowel disease who were receiving a standard oral methotrexate dose of 10-15 mg/m2 weekly and 800 mcg of folic acid daily. Baseline folate level, blood counts and chemistries, and a symptom questionnaire were completed. Subjects were switched to weekly 800 mcg of folic acid to be taken in conjunction with methotrexate. Monthly phone calls with a standardized questionnaire were used to assess compliance and any change in symptoms. Follow-up blood tests were obtained 6 months after enrollment. Normal folate level was defined as >5.38 ng/mL.Thirty-one subjects were enrolled. Five subjects were withdrawn due to poor compliance or transition to adult gastroenterology. Twenty-one (81%) subjects had Crohn's disease (17 with ileal involvement) and five (19%) had ulcerative colitis. Twelve (39%) subjects were on methotrexate as a combination therapy with a biologic agent. At the 6-month follow-up visit, all subjects had stable folic acid levels (>5.38 μg/L) without macrocytic anemia. Monthly questionnaires found no increased symptoms, and there were no adverse events.Once weekly folic acid supplementation at a dose commonly found in a multivitamin may be sufficient to maintain normal folate levels without the development of adverse symptoms in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease on methotrexate therapy.

  Title: Acute Administration of Ojeok-san Ameliorates Pain-like Behaviors in Pre-Clinical Models of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.
  Abstract: (1) Background: Gastrointestinal pain and fatigue are the most reported concerns of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Commonly prescribed drugs focus on decreasing excessive inflammation. However, up to 20% of IBD patients in an "inactive" state experience abdominal pain. The medicinal herb Ojeok-san (OJS) has shown promise in the amelioration of visceral pain. However, no research on OJS has been conducted in preclinical models of IBD. The mechanism by which OJS promotes analgesia is still elusive, and it is unclear if OJS possesses addictive properties. (2) Aims: In this study, we examined the potential of OJS to promote analgesic effects and rewarding behavior. Additionally, we investigated if tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) from macrophages is a primary culprit of IBD-induced nociception. (3) Methods: Multiple animal models of IBD were used to determine if OJS can reduce visceral nociception. TNFα-macrophage deficient mice were used to investigate the mechanism of action by which OJS reduces nociceptive behavior. Mechanical sensitivity and operant conditioning tests were used to determine the analgesic and rewarding effects of OJS. Body weight, colon length/weight, blood in stool, colonic inflammation, and complete blood count were assessed to determine disease progression. (4) Results: OJS reduced the evoked mechanical nociception in the dextran sulphate sodium model of colitis and IL-10 knockout (KO) mice and delayed aversion to colorectal distension in C57BL/6 mice. No rewarding behavior was observed in OJS-treated IL-10 KO and mdr1a KO mice. The analgesic effects of OJS are independent of macrophage TNFα levels and IBD progression. (5) Conclusions: OJS ameliorated elicited mechanical and visceral nociception without producing rewarding effects. The analgesic effects of OJS are not mediated by macrophage TNFα.

  Title: Single-Cell Sequencing-Based Validation of T Cell-Associated Diagnostic Model Genes and Drug Response in Crohn's Disease.
  Abstract: Crohn's disease is a highly heterogeneous autoimmune disease with a unique inflammatory phenotype of T cells at the lesion site. We aim to further explore the diagnosis of Crohn's disease and drug prediction of T cell marker gene expression. We obtained single-cell expression profile data from 22 CDs or normal samples and performed cell annotation and cellular communication analysis. Through the intersection of T cell marker genes, differential genes, and WGCNA results, we identified T cell-specific key genes and their immune landscapes and potential pathogenesis, and validated them across multiple datasets and patient tissue samples. We also explored the differentiation characteristics of genes by pseudo-temporal analysis and assessed their diagnostic performance and drug sensitivity by molecular docking. Finally, we extended this study to the prognosis of IBD-associated colon cancer. TNF-centered 5-gene diagnostic model not only has excellent diagnostic efficacy, but is also closely associated with KRAS, P53, and IL6/JAK/STAT3 pathways and physiological processes, such as EMT, coagulation, and apoptosis. In addition, this diagnostic model may have potential synergistic immunotherapeutic effects, with positive correlations with immune checkpoints such as CTLA4, CD86, PDCD1LG2, and CD40. Molecular docking demonstrated that BIRC3 and ANXA1 have strong binding properties to Azathioprine and Glucoocorticoid. Furthermore, the 5-gene model may suggest antagonism to IFX and prognosis for colon cancer associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Single-cell sequencing targeting T cell-related features in patients with Crohn's disease may aid in new diagnostic decisions, as well as the initial exploration of high-potential therapies.

Single-cell sequencing targeting T cell-related features in patients with Crohn's disease may aid in new diagnostic decisions, as well as the initial exploration of high-potential therapies.

  Title: Curative effects of crocin in ulcerative colitis via modulating apoptosis and inflammation.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease with characteristic inflammation to mucosal cells in rectum and colon leading to lesions in mucosa and submucosa. Moreover, crocin is a carotenoid compound among active constituents of saffron with many pharmacological effects as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities. Therefore, we aimed to investigate therapeutic effects of crocin against UC through affecting the inflammatory and apoptotic pathways. For induction of UC in rats, intracolonic 2 ml of 4% acetic acid was used. After induction of UC, part of rats was treated with 20 mg/kg crocin. cAMP was measured using ELISA. Moreover, we measured gene and protein expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), BCL2-associated X (BAX), caspase-3/8/9, NF-κB, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-1β/4/6/10. Colon sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Alcian blue or immune-stained with anti-TNF-α antibodies. Microscopic images of colon sections in UC group revealed destruction of intestinal glands associated with infiltration of inflammatory cell and severe hemorrhage. While images stained with Alcian blue showed damaged and almost absent intestinal glands. Crocin treatment ameliorated morphological changes. Finally, crocin significantly reduced expression levels of BAX, caspase-3/8/9, NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6, associated with increased levels of cAMP and expression of BCL2, IL-4 and IL-10. In conclusion, protective of action of crocin in UC is proved by restoration of normal weight and length of colon as well as improvement of morphological structure of colon cells. The mechanism of action of crocin in UC is indicated by activation of anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

  Title: Anti-β7 integrin treatment impedes the recruitment on non-classical monocytes to the gut and delays macrophage-mediated intestinal wound healing.
  Abstract: Closing mucosal defects to reach mucosal healing is an important goal of therapy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Among other cells, monocyte-derived macrophages are centrally involved in such intestinal wound healing. We had previously demonstrated that the anti-α4β7 integrin antibody vedolizumab blocks the recruitment of non-classical monocytes as biased progenitors of wound healing macrophages to the gut and delays wound healing. However, although important for the interpretation of disappointing results in recent phase III trials in IBD, the effects of the anti-β7 antibody etrolizumab on wound healing are unclear so far.We analyzed the expression of etrolizumab targets on human and mouse monocyte subsets by flow cytometry and assessed their function in adhesion and homing assays. We explored wound-associated monocyte recruitment dynamics with multi-photon microscopy and compared the effects of etrolizumab and vedolizumab surrogate (-s) antibodies on experimental wound healing and wound-associated macrophage abundance. Finally, we investigated wound healing macrophage signatures in the large intestinal transcriptome of patients with Crohn's disease treated with etrolizumab.Human and mouse non-classical monocytes expressed more αEβ7 integrin than classical monocytes and were a target of etrolizumab-s, which blocked non-classical monocyte adhesion to MAdCAM-1 and E-Cadherin as well as gut homing in vivo. Intestinal wound healing was delayed on treatment with etrolizumab-s along with a reduction of peri-lesional wound healing macrophages. Wound healing macrophage signatures in the colon of patients with Crohn's disease were substantially down-regulated on treatment with etrolizumab, but not with placebo.Combined blockade of αEβ7 and α4β7 with etrolizumab seems to exceed the effect of anti-α4β7 treatment on intestinal wound healing, which might help to inform further investigations to understand the recent observations in the etrolizumab phase III trial program.© 2023 The Authors.

  Title: "Platelet-coated bullets" biomimetic nanoparticles to ameliorate experimental colitis by targeting endothelial cells.
  Abstract: Intestinal vascular impairment is critical to the recovery of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and targeting vascular endothelial cells is a promising emerging therapeutic option. Considering the natural homing properties of platelets to activated vascular endothelium, platelet membrane-mimetic nanoparticles are expected to achieve precise treatment of IBD. Patchouli alcohol (PA) has proven efficacy in experimental colitis, yet its pharmacochemical properties require improvement to enhance efficacy. The rationale for targeting vascular lesions in IBD was analyzed by network pharmacology, and PA-affecting pathways were predicted. PA-encapsulated bio-nanoparticles (PNPs) were constructed to investigate the efficacy of agents on mouse intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (MIMVEC) inflammation model and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced acute mouse colitis model. PNPs were endocytosed by MIMVEC in vitro and efficiently enriched in inflamed colon. PNPs significantly alleviated the symptoms of experimental colitis and improved neutrophil infiltration. PNPs down-regulated LPS-induced aberrant elevation of il1β, tnfα and il6 mRNAs and reduced p65 phosphorylation in MIMVEC. Intracellular calcium expression, mitochondrial respiration and reactive oxygen species expression were also downregulated by PNPs. PNPs amplified the potency of PA as a calcium antagonist, restrained intracellular Ca2+ perturbations to prevent endothelial activation, which may block leukocyte recruitment in vivo to improve colitis.Copyright © 2023.

  Title: Isochlorogenic acid A alleviates dextran sulfate sodium-induced ulcerative colitis in mice through STAT3/NF-кB pathway.
  Abstract: Isochlorogenic acid A (ICGA-A) is a dicaffeoylquinic acid widely found in various medicinal plants or vegetables, such as Lonicerae japonicae Flos and chicory, and multiple properties of ICGA-A have been reported. However, the therapeutic effect of ICGA-A on colitis is not clear, and thus were investigated in our present study, as well as the underlying mechanisms. Here we found that ICGA-A alleviated clinical symptoms of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) induced colitis model mice, including disease activity index (DAI) and histological damage. In addition, DSS-induced inflammation was significantly attenuated in mice given ICGA-A supplementation. ICGA-A reduced the fraction of neutrophils in peripheral blood and the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages in colon tissue, and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine production and tight junctions in mouse models. Furthermore, ICGA-A down-regulated expression of STAT3 and up-regulated the protein level of IκBα. Our in vitro studies confirmed that ICGA-A inhibited the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. ICGA-A blocked the phosphorylation of STAT3, p65, and IκBα, suppressed the expression STAT3 and p65. In addition, the present study also demonstrated that ICGA-A had no obvious toxicity on normal cells and organs. Taken together, we conclude that ICGA-A mitigates experimental ulcerative colitis (UC) at least in part by inhibiting the STAT3/NF-кB signaling pathways. Hence, ICGA-A may be a promising and effective drug for treating UC.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

  Title: Cortisone-loaded stearoyl ascorbic acid based nanostructured lipid carriers alleviate inflammatory changes in DSS-induced colitis.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease which poorly affects the colon and spreads toward the rectum over time. Cortisone (CRT) is a corticosteroid clinically used for the management of inflammatory diseases like colitis and other inflammatory bowel diseases. Due to some physicochemical properties' cortisone has limited potency in clinics. To overcome drug-related problems, we successfully prepared lipid nanocarriers with generally regarded as safe (GRAS) materials approved by USFDA. The present study aimed to assess the therapeutic efficacy of CRT-loaded 6-o-stearoyl ascorbic acid (SAA) nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) against DSS-induced colitis mice. Formulation and characterizations of reported nanostructured lipid carrier were performed according to our previously optimized parameters. The average hydrodynamic diameter of NLCs was 182 nm as measured by DLS with 81.14 % encapsulation efficacy. TEM, AFM and SEM images analysis confirmed its spherical appearance. hTERT-BJ cells viability up to a dose of 500 μg/ml shows cytocompatible characteristics of blank NLCs. CRT-loaded NLCs treatment normalizes physically observed parameters such as disease activity index, weight variation etc. These NLCs were able to significantly reduce the severity of colitis in terms of colon histoarchitecture, regaining of the goblet cells, mucins secretions, inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines etc. Treatment with CRT-loaded NLCs effectively downregulated the overexpression of inflammatory enzymes like cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) etc. The results of this study concluded that these CRT-encapsulated NLCs efficiently manage the disease severity induced by DSS.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

  Title: Endoplasmic reticulum stress in the intestinal epithelium initiates purine metabolite synthesis and promotes Th17 cell differentiation in the gut.
  Abstract: Intestinal IL-17-producing T helper (Th17) cells are dependent on adherent microbes in the gut for their development. However, how microbial adherence to intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) promotes Th17 cell differentiation remains enigmatic. Here, we found that Th17 cell-inducing gut bacteria generated an unfolded protein response (UPR) in IECs. Furthermore, subtilase cytotoxin expression or genetic removal of X-box binding protein 1 (Xbp1) in IECs caused a UPR and increased Th17 cells, even in antibiotic-treated or germ-free conditions. Mechanistically, UPR activation in IECs enhanced their production of both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and purine metabolites. Treating mice with N-acetyl-cysteine or allopurinol to reduce ROS production and xanthine, respectively, decreased Th17 cells that were associated with an elevated UPR. Th17-related genes also correlated with ER stress and the UPR in humans with inflammatory bowel disease. Overall, we identify a mechanism of intestinal Th17 cell differentiation that emerges from an IEC-associated UPR.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

  Title: Endoplasmic reticulum stress in the intestinal epithelium initiates purine metabolite synthesis and promotes Th17 cell differentiation in the gut.
  Abstract: Intestinal IL-17-producing T helper (Th17) cells are dependent on adherent microbes in the gut for their development. However, how microbial adherence to intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) promotes Th17 cell differentiation remains enigmatic. Here, we found that Th17 cell-inducing gut bacteria generated an unfolded protein response (UPR) in IECs. Furthermore, subtilase cytotoxin expression or genetic removal of X-box binding protein 1 (Xbp1) in IECs caused a UPR and increased Th17 cells, even in antibiotic-treated or germ-free conditions. Mechanistically, UPR activation in IECs enhanced their production of both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and purine metabolites. Treating mice with N-acetyl-cysteine or allopurinol to reduce ROS production and xanthine, respectively, decreased Th17 cells that were associated with an elevated UPR. Th17-related genes also correlated with ER stress and the UPR in humans with inflammatory bowel disease. Overall, we identify a mechanism of intestinal Th17 cell differentiation that emerges from an IEC-associated UPR.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

  Title: Photodynamic Effects with 5-Aminolevulinic Acid on Cytokines and Exosomes in Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells from Patients with Crohn's Disease.
  Abstract: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) using 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) which is the precursor of the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) is an available treatment for several diseases. ALA-PDT induces the apoptosis and necrosis of target lesions. We have recently reported the effects of ALA-PDT on cytokines and exosomes of human healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This study has investigated the ALA-PDT-mediated effects on PBMC subsets from patients with active Crohn's disease (CD). No effects on lymphocyte survival after ALA-PDT were observed, although the survival of CD3-/CD19+ B-cells seemed slightly reduced in some samples. Interestingly, ALA-PDT clearly killed monocytes. The subcellular levels of cytokines and exosomes associated with inflammation were widely downregulated, which is consistent with our previous findings in PBMCs from healthy human subjects. These results suggest that ALA-PDT may be a potential treatment candidate for CD and other immune-mediated diseases.

  Title: Tofacitinib fails to prevent T cell transfer colitis in mice but ameliorates disease activity.
  Abstract: Tofactinib is a JAK inhibitor approved for ulcerative colitis in humans. Despite of its' proven effectiveness in humans, mechanistic data are scarce on the effectiveness of Tofactinib in experimental colitis in mice. We induced experimental colitis by transfer of CD4+CD25- isolated T cells into RAG2-/- (T and B cell deficient) mice and treated these mice with tofacitinib for 5-6 weeks either with a dosage of 10 or 40 mg/kg body weight immediately after CD4+ transfer or started treatment after first symptoms of disease for several weeks. While treatment with tofacitinib immediately after transfer resulted in an enhanced expansion of CD4+ T cells and did not prevent occurrence of colitis, treatment after start of symptoms of colitis ameliorated disease activity on a clinical basis and in histological analyses. Tofacitinib is effective in the treatment of murine experimental T cell transfer colitis, however does not prevent occurrence of disease.© 2023. The Author(s).

  Title: Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis and Crohn's disease: characterization of the interaction with different aspects of the disease.
  Abstract: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic granulomatous inflammatory bowel disease with no fully understood etiology and cure. Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP), the etiologic agent of paratuberculosis, is also isolated from samples from human patients with CD. Paratuberculosis is characterized by persistent diarrhea and progressive weight loss and primarily affects ruminants, which eliminate the agent via feces and milk. The involvement of MAP in the pathogenesis of CD and other intestinal diseases is unclear. Thus, the present study aimed to analyze immunological, socioepidemiological, biochemical, and therapeutic variables that may be related to the occurrence of MAP in blood samples and CD patients. The sampling was random, and the population of origin was the patients from the Bowel Outpatient Clinic of the Alpha Institute of Gastroenterology (IAG), Hospital das Clínicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (HC-UFMG). Blood samples were collected from 20 patients with CD, eight with ulcerative rectocolitis (UCR), and 10 control patients without inflammatory bowel diseases. Samples were subjected to real-time PCR for detection of MAP DNA, oxidative stress analyses, and socioepidemiological variables. MAP was detected in 10 (26.3%) of the patients, seven (70%) were CD patients, 2 (20%) were URC patients, and one (10%) was a non-IBD patient. MAP was found more frequently among CD patients, but not restricted to CD patients. The presence of MAP in the blood of these patients occurred simultaneously with an inflammatory response with an increase in neutrophils and significant alterations in the production of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase and GST.© 2023.

  Title: Nitric Oxide, Neutrophil/Lymphocyte, and Platelet/Lymphocyte Ratios as Promising Inflammatory Biomarkers in Complicated Crohn's Disease: Outcomes of Corticosteroids and Anti-TNF-α Therapies.
  Abstract: Crohn's disease (CD) is a relapsing-remitting inflammatory bowel disease with a progressive course. The aim of our study was to evaluate the relationship between nitric oxide (NO), pro-inflammatory cytokines, and blood count-based ratios in patients with complicated Crohn's disease as well as the outcome of corticosteroid or anti-TNF-α therapy. In this context, we evaluated the NLR as the ratio of neutrophils count to lymphocytes count, PLR as the ratio of platelets count to lymphocytes count, and MLR as the ratio of monocytes count to lymphocytes count in patients and controls. Furthermore, we assessed NO production by the Griess method in plasma along with iNOS and NF-κB expression by immunofluorescence method in intestinal tissues of patients and controls. In the same way, we evaluated plasma TNF-α, IL-17A, and IL-10 levels using ELISA. Our results indicate that blood count-based ratios NLR, PLR, and MLR were significantly higher in patients compared to controls. In addition, increased systemic levels of NO, TNF-α, and IL-17A and colonic expression of iNOS and NF-κB were observed in the same patients. Interestingly, the high ratio of NLR and MLR as well as NO production were significantly decreased in treated patients. Collectively, our findings suggest that nitric oxide as well as the blood count-based ratios (NLR, PLR, MLR) could constitute useful biomarkers in complicated Crohn's disease, predicting the response to treatments.© 2023.

  Title: Therapeutic effect of Yiyi Fuzi Baijiang formula on TNBS-induced ulcerative colitis via metabolism and Th17/Treg cell balance.
  Abstract: Yiyi Fuzi Baijiang formula (YFB) is a traditional Chinese medicine prescription composed of Coix seed, Radix Aconiti Lateralis and Patrinia villosa, which has been used to treat ulcerative colitis (UC) for thousands of years.To investigate the therapeutic effect and metabolic analysis of YFB formula on UC in rats induced by 2,4,6-trinitro-benzene sulfonic acid (TNBS).Six main alkaloids in the YFB formula were determined by UPLC‒MS/MS. The rat UC model was induced by TNBS, and the therapeutic effect of YFB formula on UC was evaluated by disease activity index (DAI) score and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. UPLC-QTRAP-MS metabolomics technology was used to screen potential biomarkers for YFB treatment of UC in combination with multivariate data statistics and further analyze related metabolic pathways. Western blotting was used to detect the protein levels of NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4, ASC, pro-caspase1 and Caspase-1 in rat liver tissues. ELISA and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the contents of interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-21, IL-22, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-18 in rat serum and liver tissues.The DAI scores of the YFB groups were significantly reduced, and colon tissue injury was significantly improved (p < 0.01). The results of metabolomics analysis revealed 29 potential biomarkers in serum and 27 potential biomarkers in liver. YFB formula can treat UC by affecting glycerophospholipid metabolism, primary bile acid biosynthesis, glyoxylic acid and dicarboxylic acid metabolism, and arginine and proline metabolism. Compared with the model group, the contents of IL-17A, IL-21, IL-22, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-18 in the YFB groups were decreased in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.01). Compared with those in the model group, the protein levels of NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4, ASC, pro-caspase1 and Caspase-1 in the YFB groups were significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.01).The therapeutic effect of YFB formula on UC rats was dose dependent, and the effect of the YFB (2.046 g/kg) group was close to that of the positive group. YFB formula has an anti-inflammatory effect on UC by regulating the balance of Th17/Treg cells in rats.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

  Title: MIF Variant rs755622 Is Associated with Severe Crohn's Disease and Better Response to Anti-TNF Adalimumab Therapy.
  Abstract: Crohn's disease (CD), rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and other inflammatory diseases comprise a group of chronic diseases with immune-mediated pathogenesis which share common pathological pathways, as well as treatment strategies including anti-TNF biologic therapy. However, the response rate to anti-TNF therapy among those diseases varies, and approximately one third of patients do not respond. Since pharmacogenetic studies for anti-TNF therapy have been more frequent for other related diseases and are rare in CD, the aim of our study was to further explore markers associated with anti-TNF response in other inflammatory diseases in Slovenian CD patients treated with the anti-TNF drug adalimumab (ADA). We enrolled 102 CD patients on ADA, for which the response was defined after 4, 12, 20 and 30 weeks of treatment, using an IBDQ questionnaire and blood CRP value. We genotyped 41 SNPs significantly associated with response to anti-TNF treatment in other diseases. We found novel pharmacogenetic association between SNP rs755622 in the gene MIF (macrophage migration inhibitory factor) and SNP rs3740691 in the gene ARFGAP2 in CD patients treated with ADA. The strongest and most consistent association with treatment response was found for the variant rs2275913 in gene IL17A (p = 9.73 × 10-3).

  Title: MIF Variant rs755622 Is Associated with Severe Crohn's Disease and Better Response to Anti-TNF Adalimumab Therapy.
  Abstract: Crohn's disease (CD), rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and other inflammatory diseases comprise a group of chronic diseases with immune-mediated pathogenesis which share common pathological pathways, as well as treatment strategies including anti-TNF biologic therapy. However, the response rate to anti-TNF therapy among those diseases varies, and approximately one third of patients do not respond. Since pharmacogenetic studies for anti-TNF therapy have been more frequent for other related diseases and are rare in CD, the aim of our study was to further explore markers associated with anti-TNF response in other inflammatory diseases in Slovenian CD patients treated with the anti-TNF drug adalimumab (ADA). We enrolled 102 CD patients on ADA, for which the response was defined after 4, 12, 20 and 30 weeks of treatment, using an IBDQ questionnaire and blood CRP value. We genotyped 41 SNPs significantly associated with response to anti-TNF treatment in other diseases. We found novel pharmacogenetic association between SNP rs755622 in the gene MIF (macrophage migration inhibitory factor) and SNP rs3740691 in the gene ARFGAP2 in CD patients treated with ADA. The strongest and most consistent association with treatment response was found for the variant rs2275913 in gene IL17A (p = 9.73 × 10-3).

  Title: Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients Hospitalized With a Central Line.
  Abstract: Patients hospitalized with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The aim of this study was to determine whether the adoption of a VTE protocol would change rates of medical VTE prophylaxis (low molecular weight heparin) in patients with IBD and a central venous catheter (CVC), while subsequently decreasing the incidence of VTE in this population.A protocol for VTE prophylaxis in IBD was established in March of 2018. Every patient hospitalized with an IBD flare and central venous access from March 2013 to March 2020 was identified. Study data, including patient demographics, rates of Doppler ultrasound (US), and rates of VTE were collected using International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes, CPT codes, and chart review retrospectively. Determination of an IBD flare was based on physician global assessment. Groups were compared with independent-sample t tests and chi-squared tests.A total of 313 hospitalizations across 187 different patients were identified that met criteria including IBD and central venous access. VTE prophylaxis increased from 5.24% (n = 12) prior to the intervention to 63.10% (n = 53) after the intervention [chi-square (1, N = 313) = 125.0192, P < 0.001]. Rate of Doppler US increased from 9.17% (n = 21) prior to the intervention to 17.86% (n = 15) after the intervention [chi-square (1, N = 313) = 4.5562, P < 0.05]. Diagnosis of VTE increased from 0.87% (n = 2) prior to the intervention to 7.14% (n = 6) after the intervention [chi-square (1, N = 313) = 9.6992, P < 0.01]. There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristics pre- versus post-intervention.Rates of Doppler US and VTE prophylaxis use increased significantly after implementation of a VTE protocol. Rates of VTE diagnosis also increased, though we suspect this may be due to missed diagnoses prior to implementation of the protocol and increased risk awareness after the protocol was established.Copyright © 2023 by European Society for European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition and North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition.

  Title: Comparison of 3 Enzyme-Linked Immunoassay Methods to Evaluate Serum Concentrations of Infliximab and Antibodies to Infliximab in 32 Patients with Moderate to Severe Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Abstract: BACKGROUND Monitoring of trough levels and anti-drug antibodies is important when patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are treated with anti-TNF biologics due to guided therapeutic decisions. The comparability of 3 ELISA tests for detection of the lowest serum concentration of infliximab (IFX) or antibodies to IFX (ATIs) was evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS Two commercial assays for measuring IFX levels were compared with the in-house (UHL) test. ATIs were measured with 1 commercial test and compared to the in-house test. According to the guidelines, IFX levels were within the range of 3 to 7 µg/mL. RESULTS The decision to continue therapy would be the same for 11 out of 16 patients when comparing the apDia Infliximab ELISA and UHL test, and for 12 out of 18 patients when comparing the Lisa-Tracker and in-house UHL test. Linear correlations between the tests were R=0.92 (UHL and apDia), R=0.91 (apDia and Lisa-Tracker), and R=0.89 (UHL and Lisa-Tracker) with P<0.001, respectively. CONCLUSIONS As the IFX levels are important for decisions on further therapy, detectable IFX levels realistically reflect the presence of the drug in the patients' blood and thus control inflammatory activity. The tests were found as comparable and performed well in this aspect and might be used in everyday clinical practice.

  Title: Children with inflammatory bowel disease already have an altered arterial pulse wave.
  Abstract: Adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased risk for vascular events. This study aims to evaluate arterial parameters in paediatric IBD. Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) was measured by ultrasound, and Arteriograph was used to assess aortic pulse wave velocity (PWVao), brachial and aortic augmentation indexes (AixBrach, AixAo), central systolic blood pressure (SBPao), and heart rate (HR). A total of 161 children were included; 55 (34%) children with newly diagnosed IBD (median age 14.35 (11.88-16.31) years, 53% males), 53(33%) in remission (median age 15.62 (13.46-16.70) years, 66% males), and 53 (33%) controls (median age 14.09 (11.18-14.09) years, 55% males) were recruited into a case-control study. Compared to controls, patients with active disease and those in clinical remission had significantly lower AixBrach and AixAo (P < 0.001, P = 0.009; P < 0.001, P = 0.003). PWVao and CIMT were still normal. HR was higher in both IBD groups than in controls (P < 0.001; P = 0.006). HR positively correlated with disease duration (P = 0.001). In the ordinary least squares regression models, anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) α treatment predicted lower peripheral and central systolic blood pressures, in contrast to aminosalicylates and methotrexate. Aminosalicylate treatment predicted increased HR.  Conclusion: Children with IBD have an increased heart rate, a lower augmentation index and, therefore, an altered pulse waveform. In paediatric IBD, arterial stiffness and CIMT are still normal, indicating the potential for adequate IBD treatment to preserve arterial health. What is Known: • Adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have increased carotid intima-media thickness and arterial stiffness, which positively correlates with cardiovascular risk and predicts mortality. Adequate treatment, especially anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) α medications, lower these risks. • Children with IBD have impaired endothelial function and reduced heart rate (HR) variability. What is New: • Children with IBD have impaired endothelial function and reduced heart rate (HR) variability. • Anti-TNFα treatment in children and adolescents with IBD lowers systolic pressure, whereas methotrexate and aminosalicylates have the opposite effect. Amiynosalyiciylate treatment also increases HR.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

  Title: Distinct transcriptional signatures in purified circulating immune cells drive heterogeneity in disease location in IBD.
  Abstract: To infer potential mechanisms driving disease subtypes among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we profiled the transcriptome of purified circulating monocytes and CD4 T-cells.RNA extracted from purified monocytes and CD4 T-cells derived from the peripheral blood of 125 endoscopically active patients with IBD was sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 4000NGS. We used complementary supervised and unsupervised analytical methods to infer gene expression signatures associated with demographic/clinical features. Expression differences and specificity were validated by comparison with publicly available single cell datasets, tissue-specific expression and meta-analyses. Drug target information, druggability and adverse reaction records were used to prioritise disease subtype-specific therapeutic targets.Unsupervised/supervised methods identified significant differences in the expression profiles of CD4 T-cells between patients with ileal Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Following a pathway-based classification (Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic - AUROC=86%) between ileal-CD and UC patients, we identified MAPK and FOXO pathways to be downregulated in UC. Coexpression module/regulatory network analysis using systems-biology approaches revealed mediatory core transcription factors. We independently confirmed that a subset of the disease location-associated signature is characterised by T-cell-specific and location-specific expression. Integration of drug-target information resulted in the discovery of several new (BCL6, GPR183, TNFAIP3) and repurposable drug targets (TUBB2A, PRKCQ) for ileal CD as well as novel targets (NAPEPLD, SLC35A1) for UC.Transcriptomic profiling of circulating CD4 T-cells in patients with IBD demonstrated marked molecular differences between the IBD-spectrum extremities (UC and predominantly ileal CD, sandwiching colonic CD), which could help in prioritising particular drug targets for IBD subtypes.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

  Title: Neutrophil-to-Platelet Ratio in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis Treated with Infliximab or Vedolizumab: A Retrospective, Single-Center Study in Poland.
  Abstract: BACKGROUND This retrospective study from a single center in Poland was undertaken to evaluate the clinical utility of neutrophil-to-platelet ratio in therapy of 35 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients with infliximab or vedolizumab. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study included 35 patients: 16 were treated with infliximab and 19 were treated with vedolizumab. Treatment response was evaluated using partial Mayo score. Treatment response was defined as a reduction of partial Mayo score of ≥3 points followed by a decrease of a minimum of 30% from the baseline, decrease in the rectal bleeding subscore of ≥1, or an absolute rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. During the maintenance period, we diagnosed 13 patients with loss of response (LOR) (5 with infliximab and 8 with vedolizumab). The Mann-Whitney U test was performed to assess differences between the groups. Statistical significance was defined as P<0.05. The median was used to describe the value of the parameter. Analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with the determination of area under the curve (AUC) was performed for the neutrophil-to-platelet parameter during the induction period. RESULTS The median value of the neutrophil-to-platelet ratio for the treatment response group was lower than in the LOR group (median=13.18 and median=19.49, respectively). Calculation of AUC curve for neutrophil-to-platelet ratio during the induction period showed best sensitivity and specificity for values ≥32.511. There were no other significant findings. CONCLUSIONS Neutrophil-to-platelet ratio might be a promising biomarker of LOR in biologic therapy of UC. However, to fully prove this, further studies are needed.

  Title: Geniposide promotes splenic Treg differentiation to alleviate colonic inflammation and intestinal barrier injury in ulcerative colitis mice.
  Abstract: Geniposide has been proven to have a therapeutic effect on ulcerative colitis (UC) in animals, but its potential mechanism in UC remains to be clarified. The purpose of this study was to confirm the efficacy of geniposide in UC and to investigate the possible mechanism of geniposide in UC treatment. In vivo, geniposide relieved weight loss and reduced intestinal tissue damage in UC mice. Geniposide decreased the levels of IL-1β and TNF-α and increased IL-10 levels in the colon and serum of UC mice. Geniposide increased FOXP3 expression in the colon and the number of CD4+ FOXP3+ cells in the spleen of UC mice. BD750 abolished the above regulatory effect of GE on UC mice. In vitro, geniposide increased the number of CD4+ FOXP3+ cells in spleen cells from normal mice, decreased the levels of IL-1β, CCL2 and TNF-α in the supernatant of LPS-treated Caco-2 cells, and decreased the protein expression of Beclin-1 and Occludin in cacO-2 cells. Epirubicin inhibited the effect of geniposide on increasing the number of CD4+ FOXP3+ cells in spleen cells, attenuated the inhibitory effect of geniposide on proinflammatory factors and attenuated the upregulation of geniposide on tight junction proteins in LPS-treated Caco-2 cells in the coculture system. In conclusion, geniposide has an effective therapeutic effect on UC. Increasing Treg differentiation of spleen cells is the mechanism by which geniposide alleviates intestinal inflammation and barrier injury in UC.

  Title: Type 2 and type 17 effector cells are increased in the duodenal mucosa but not peripheral blood of patients with functional dyspepsia.
  Abstract: Functional dyspepsia is characterised by chronic symptoms of post-prandial distress or epigastric pain not associated with defined structural pathology. Increased peripheral gut-homing T cells have been previously identified in patients. To date, it is unknown if these T cells were antigen-experienced, or if a specific phenotype was associated with FD.This study aimed to characterise T cell populations in the blood and duodenal mucosa of FD patients that may be implicated in disease pathophysiology.We identified duodenal T cell populations from 23 controls and 49 Rome III FD patients by flow cytometry using a surface marker antibody panel. We also analysed T cell populations in peripheral blood from 37 controls and 61 patients. Where available, we examined the number of duodenal eosinophils in patients and controls.There was a shift in the duodenal T helper cell balance in FD patients compared to controls. For example, patients had increased duodenal mucosal Th2 populations in the effector (13.03 ± 16.11, 19.84 ± 15.51, p=0.038), central memory (23.75 ± 18.97, 37.52 ± 17.51, p=0.007) and effector memory (9.80±10.50 vs 20.53±14.15, p=0.001) populations. Th17 populations were also increased in the effector (31.74±24.73 vs 45.57±23.75, p=0.03) and effector memory (11.95±8.42 vs 18.44±15.63, p=0.027) subsets. Peripheral T cell populations were unchanged between FD and control.Our findings identify an association between lymphocyte populations and FD, specifically a Th2 and Th17 signature in the duodenal mucosa. The presence of effector and memory cells suggest that the microinflammation in FD is antigen driven.Copyright © 2023 Burns, Bruce, Minahan, Mathe, Fairlie, Cameron, Naudin, Nair, Potter, Irani, Bollipo, Foster, Gan, Shah, Koloski, Foster, Horvat, Veysey, Holtmann, Powell, Walker, Talley and Keely.

  Title: Unveiling the biological role of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators in inflammatory bowel diseases.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that has a high epidemiological prevalence worldwide. The increasing disease burden worldwide, lack of response to current biologic therapeutics, and treatment-related immunogenicity have led to major concerns regarding the clinical management of IBD patients and treatment efficacy. Understanding disease pathogenesis and disease-related molecular mechanisms is the most important goal in developing new and effective therapeutics. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor (S1PR) modulators form a class of oral small molecule drugs currently in clinical development for IBD have shown promising effects on disease improvement. S1P is a sphingosine-derived phospholipid that acts by binding to its receptor S1PR and is involved in the regulation of several biological processes including cell survival, differentiation, migration, proliferation, immune response, and lymphocyte trafficking. T lymphocytes play an important role in regulating inflammatory responses. In inflamed IBD tissue, an imbalance between T helper (Th) and regulatory T lymphocytes and Th cytokine levels was found. The S1P/S1PR signaling axis and metabolism have been linked to inflammatory responses in IBD. S1P modulators targeting S1PRs and S1P metabolism have been developed and shown to regulate inflammatory responses by affecting lymphocyte trafficking, lymphocyte number, lymphocyte activity, cytokine production, and contributing to gut barrier function.©The Author(s) 2023.

  Title: Leaky Gut and the Ingredients That Help Treat It: A Review.
  Abstract: The human body is in daily contact with potentially toxic and infectious substances in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). The GIT has the most significant load of antigens. The GIT can protect the intestinal integrity by allowing the passage of beneficial agents and blocking the path of harmful substances. Under normal conditions, a healthy intestinal barrier prevents toxic elements from entering the blood stream. However, factors such as stress, an unhealthy diet, excessive alcohol, antibiotics, and drug consumption can compromise the composition of the intestinal microbiota and the homeostasis of the intestinal barrier function of the intestine, leading to increased intestinal permeability. Intestinal hyperpermeability can allow the entry of harmful agents through the junctions of the intestinal epithelium, which pass into the bloodstream and affect various organs and systems. Thus, leaky gut syndrome and intestinal barrier dysfunction are associated with intestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as extra-intestinal diseases, including heart diseases, obesity, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and celiac disease. Given the relationship between intestinal permeability and numerous conditions, it is convenient to seek an excellent strategy to avoid or reduce the increase in intestinal permeability. The impact of dietary nutrients on barrier function can be crucial for designing new strategies for patients with the pathogenesis of leaky gut-related diseases associated with epithelial barrier dysfunctions. In this review article, the role of functional ingredients is suggested as mediators of leaky gut-related disorders.

  Title: Effects of the Antioxidant Quercetin in an Experimental Model of Ulcerative Colitis in Mice.
  Abstract: Background and Objectives: Quercetin, a member of the flavanol family found in many fruits, vegetables, leaves and grains has been found to have a wide range of biological effects on human physiology. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of quercetin, when administered orally in the form of the water-soluble inclusion complex with hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin (Que-HP-β-CD), in an experimental model of ulcerative colitis in mice. Materials and Methods: Animals received either Dextran Sodium Sulphate (DSS), to induce colitis, + Que-HP-β-CD (Group A), DSS alone (Group B) or no intervention (control, Group C) for 7 days. All animals were weighed daily, and evaluation of colitis was performed using the Disease Activity Index (DAI). On day 7 a blood sample was taken from all animals, they were then euthanised, the large intestine was measured, and histological and immunochemical analyses were performed. Results: The DAI demonstrated an increase over time for the groups receiving DSS (Groups A and B) compared with the control group (Group C), with a significant degree of protection being observed in the group that also received quercetin (Group A): The DAI over time slope for Group B was higher than that for Group A by 0.26 points/day (95% Cl 0.20−0.33, p < 0.01). Weight calculations and immunohistochemistry results validated the DAI findings. Conclusions: In conclusion, the administration of quercetin in an ulcerative colitis model in mice presents a therapeutic/prophylactic potential that warrants further investigation.

  Title: Corylin ameliorates chronic ulcerative colitis via regulating the gut-brain axis and promoting 5-hydroxytryptophan production in the colon.
  Abstract: Chronic ulcerative colitis (UC) is a lifelong disease, patients with chronic UC have a high prevalence of common mental disorders. The increasing interest in the role of gut-brain axis is seen in inflammatory bowel diseases.Corylin is a representative flavonoid compound isolated from the Psoraleae Fructus. This study aimed to identify the effects and mechanism of corylin on the inflammation interactions and 5-HT synthesis between the gut and brain in chronic UC.Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced chronic UC mouse model was established to assess the therapeutic effect of corylin on chronic UC symptoms. The expression of inflammatory cytokines was detected in the colon and brain. The expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins of intestinal mucosal barrier and blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) in the hippocampus were determined by western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. In addition, several tryptophan (Trp) metabolites and related neurotransmitters in faeces, colon, serum, and brain were detected by UPLC-MS/MS. The interaction between corylin and 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase (5-HTPDC) was performed by molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Finally, the changes of gut microbiota composition were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing.Corylin significantly alleviated colitis symptoms and inhibited inflammatory response in the colon and brain of DSS-induced chronic UC mice. The TJ proteins of intestinal mucosal barrier and BBB were improved and the expression of Iba1 in the hippocampus was normalized after corylin treatment. In addition, corylin treatment increased the expression of neurotransmitters in the brain, especially 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), but the expression of 5-HT in the colon was inhibited. Further study firstly proved that corylin could bind to the 5-HTDPC, and then inhibit the expression of 5-HTDPC and VB6, resulting in the 5-HT reduction and 5-HTP accumulation in the colon. Moreover, the intake of corylin transformed the diversity and composition of intestinal microbiota, Bacteroides, Escherichia-Shigella, and Turicibacter were decreased but Dubosiella, Enterorhabdus, and Candidatus_Stoquefichus were increased.Corylin administration ameliorated DSS-induced colitis and inhibited intestinal inflammation and neuroinflammation via regulating the inflammation interactions across gut-brain axis and increasing 5-HTP generation in the colon.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier GmbH.

  Title: Corylin ameliorates chronic ulcerative colitis via regulating the gut-brain axis and promoting 5-hydroxytryptophan production in the colon.
  Abstract: Chronic ulcerative colitis (UC) is a lifelong disease, patients with chronic UC have a high prevalence of common mental disorders. The increasing interest in the role of gut-brain axis is seen in inflammatory bowel diseases.Corylin is a representative flavonoid compound isolated from the Psoraleae Fructus. This study aimed to identify the effects and mechanism of corylin on the inflammation interactions and 5-HT synthesis between the gut and brain in chronic UC.Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced chronic UC mouse model was established to assess the therapeutic effect of corylin on chronic UC symptoms. The expression of inflammatory cytokines was detected in the colon and brain. The expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins of intestinal mucosal barrier and blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) in the hippocampus were determined by western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. In addition, several tryptophan (Trp) metabolites and related neurotransmitters in faeces, colon, serum, and brain were detected by UPLC-MS/MS. The interaction between corylin and 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase (5-HTPDC) was performed by molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Finally, the changes of gut microbiota composition were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing.Corylin significantly alleviated colitis symptoms and inhibited inflammatory response in the colon and brain of DSS-induced chronic UC mice. The TJ proteins of intestinal mucosal barrier and BBB were improved and the expression of Iba1 in the hippocampus was normalized after corylin treatment. In addition, corylin treatment increased the expression of neurotransmitters in the brain, especially 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), but the expression of 5-HT in the colon was inhibited. Further study firstly proved that corylin could bind to the 5-HTDPC, and then inhibit the expression of 5-HTDPC and VB6, resulting in the 5-HT reduction and 5-HTP accumulation in the colon. Moreover, the intake of corylin transformed the diversity and composition of intestinal microbiota, Bacteroides, Escherichia-Shigella, and Turicibacter were decreased but Dubosiella, Enterorhabdus, and Candidatus_Stoquefichus were increased.Corylin administration ameliorated DSS-induced colitis and inhibited intestinal inflammation and neuroinflammation via regulating the inflammation interactions across gut-brain axis and increasing 5-HTP generation in the colon.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier GmbH.

  Title: ABX464 (Obefazimod) Upregulates miR-124 to Reduce Proinflammatory Markers in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.
  Abstract: Advanced therapies have transformed the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease; however, many patients fail to respond, highlighting the need for therapies tailored to the underlying cell and molecular disease drivers. The first-in-class oral molecule ABX464 (obefazimod), which selectively upregulates miR-124, has demonstrated its ability to be a well-tolerated treatment with rapid and sustained efficacy in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Here, we provide evidence that ABX464 affects the immune system in vitro , in the murine model of inflammatory bowel disease, and in patients with UC. In vitro , ABX464 treatment upregulated miR-124 and led to decreases in proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL) 17 and IL6, and in the chemokine CCL2. Consistently, miR-124 expression was upregulated in the rectal biopsies and blood samples of patients with UC, and a parallel reduction in Th17 cells and IL17a levels was observed in serum samples. In a mouse model of induced intestinal inflammation with dextran sulfate sodium, ABX464 reversed the increases in multiple proinflammatory cytokines in the colon and the upregulation of IL17a secretion in the mesenteric lymph nodes. By upregulating miR-124, ABX464 acts as "a physiological brake" of inflammation, which may explain the efficacy of ABX464 with a favorable tolerability and safety profile in patients with UC.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

  Title: Common laboratory blood test immune panel markers are useful for grading ulcerative colitis endoscopic severity.
  Abstract: At present, many indicators reflect the clinical disease activity of ulcerative colitis (UC). However, commonly used inflammatory markers do not show good utility for indicating endoscopic disease activity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), C-reactive protein to albumin ratio (CAR), inflammatory markers, and complete blood count (CBC) related parameters in patients with UC as simple, non-invasive, and independent markers of endoscopic activity (EA).We retrospectively collected extensive data from the hospital medical records of 386 patients who presented with UC to the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University (Urumqi, China) from 2018 to 2022 January. The Mayo endoscopic score (MES) was used to evaluate endoscopic disease activity. All included patients were defined as the MES-All group; those with extensive colitis (E3) were defined as the MES-E3 group. Demographics, laboratory parameters, endoscopic results, the extent of disease, and drug history were recorded and analyzed.For patients in the MES-All or MES-E3 group, hs-CRP, CAR, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were significantly higher in EA UC patients than in those with mucosal healing. The mean platelet volume (MPV) and lymphocyte to monocyte ratio were significantly lower in active disease than in the patient's remission (p < 0.001). ROC analysis showed that in the MES-All and MES-E3 groups, the cutoff values of hs-CRP activity under endoscopy were 5.32 mg/L (AUC 0.850, sensitivity 77.6%, specificity 81.9%) and 5.16 mg/L (AUC 0.902, sensitivity 86.9%, specificity 85.4%) respectively, and the cutoff values of CAR were 0.14 (AUC 0.853, sensitivity 76.8%, specificity 84.8%) and 0.18 (AUC 0.904, sensitivity 81.8%, specificity 89.6%) respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that hs-CRP, CAR, NLR, and PLR identified UC EA, while decreased MPV reflected inflammatory activity in the UC mucosa.Especially in patients with extensive colitis, hs-CRP and CAR are closely related to EA and show a higher diagnostic value compared to the related CBC parameters. The aforementioned indicators are simple and non-invasive independent markers that reflect the EA in UC.© 2022. The Author(s).

  Title: Pentosan Polysulfate Maculopathy
  Abstract: Pentosan polysulfate (PPS) is a semisynthetic pentasaccharide heparinoid with anticoagulant properties and was initially used in the 1950s as a thrombolytic due to the ability of the molecule to bind the glycocalyx of circulating red blood cells. It is the only medication approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to treat interstitial cystitis (IC).  Interstitial cystitis is characterized by bladder pain (suprapubic, pelvic, urethral, vaginal, or perineal) caused by filling and relieved by emptying with petechial bladder mucosal hemorrhages on endoscopy and decreased bladder compliance on urodynamics. This disease is very common: it affects over one million Americans, the vast majority female. In the bladder, PPS is postulated to bind to the urothelium and replace disrupted glycosaminoglycans to protect the urothelium. Less frequently, PPS is used for other indications, including irritable bowel syndrome, pelvic pain syndrome, and inner bladder wall cracks. The recommended dosage for PPS is 100 mg three times a day. Twenty-two years after its approval as a second-line agent for interstitial cystitis, a six-patient case series described a progressive maculopathy associated with long-term use of the drug, an association that researchers have demonstrated and characterized multiple times.Copyright © 2023, StatPearls Publishing LLC.

  Title: The novel sustained 3-hydroxybutyrate donor poly-D-3-hydroxybutyric acid prevents inflammatory bowel disease through upregulation of regulatory T-cells.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic persistent intestinal disorder, with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease being the most common. However, the physio-pathological development of IBD is still unknown. Therefore, research on the etiology and treatment of IBD has been conducted using a variety of approaches. Short-chain fatty acids such as 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB) are known to have various physiological activities. In particular, the production of 3-HB by the intestinal microflora is associated with the suppression of various inflammatory diseases. In this study, we investigated whether poly-D-3-hydroxybutyric acid (PHB), a polyester of 3-HB, is degraded by intestinal microbiota and works as a slow-release agent of 3-HB. Further, we examined whether PHB suppresses the pathogenesis of IBD models. As long as a PHB diet increased 3-HB concentrations in the feces and blood, PHB suppressed weight loss and histological inflammation in a dextran sulfate sodium-induced IBD model. Furthermore, PHB increased the accumulation of regulatory T cells in the rectum without affecting T cells in the spleen. These results indicate that PHB has potential applications in treating diseases related to the intestinal microbiota as a sustained 3-HB donor. We show for the first time that biodegradable polyester exhibits intestinal bacteria-mediated bioactivity toward IBD. The use of bioplastics, which are essential materials for sustainable social development, represents a novel approach to diseases related to dysbiosis, including IBD.© 2022 The Authors.

  Title: Folic acid attenuates chronic visceral pain by reducing clostridiales abundance and hydrogen sulfide production.
  Abstract: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) related chronic visceral pain affects 20% of people worldwide. The treatment options are very limited. Although the scholarly reviews have appraised the potential effects of the intestinal microbiota on intestinal motility and sensation, the exact mechanism of intestinal microbiota in IBS-like chronic visceral pain remains largely unclear. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether Folic Acid (FA) attenuated visceral pain and its possible mechanisms. Chronic visceral hyperalgesia was induced in rats by neonatal colonic inflammation (NCI). 16S rDNA analysis of fecal samples from human subjects and rats was performed. Patch clamp recording was used to determine synaptic transmission of colonic-related spinal dorsal horn. Alpha diversity of intestinal flora was increased in patients with IBS, as well as the obviously increased abundance of Clostridiales order (a main bacteria producing hydrogen sulfide). The hydrogen sulfide content was positive correlation with visceral pain score in patients with IBS. Consistently, NCI increased Clostridiales frequency and hydrogen sulfide content in feces of adult rats. Notably, the concentration of FA was markedly decreased in peripheral blood of IBS patients compared with non-IBS human subjects. FA supplement alleviated chronic visceral pain and normalized the Clostridiales frequency in NCI rats. In addition, FA supplement significantly reduced the frequency of sEPSCs of neurons in the spinal dorsal horn of NCI rats. Folic Acid treatment attenuated chronic visceral pain of NCI rats through reducing hydrogen sulfide production from Clostridiales in intestine.

  Title: Repurposing a Drug Targeting Inflammatory Bowel Disease for Lowering Hypertension.
  Abstract: Background The gut and gut microbiota, which were previously neglected in blood pressure regulation, are becoming increasingly recognized as factors contributing to hypertension. Diseases affecting the gut such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) present with aberrant energy metabolism of colonic epithelium and gut dysbiosis, both of which are also mechanisms contributing to hypertension. We reasoned that current measures to remedy deficits in colonic energy metabolism and dysbiosis in IBD could also ameliorate hypertension. Among them, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA; mesalamine) is a PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) agonist. It attenuates IBD by a dual mechanism of selectively enhancing colonic epithelial cell energy metabolism and ameliorating gut dysbiosis. Methods and Results A total of 2 groups of 11- to 12-week-old male, hypertensive, Dahl salt-sensitive (S) rats were gavaged with (n=10) or without (n=10) 5-aminosalicylic acid (150 mg/kg) for 4 weeks. Rats receiving 5-aminosalicylic acid treatment had a lower mean blood pressure than controls (145±3 mm Hg versus 153±4 mm Hg; P<0.0001). This reduction in blood pressure was accompanied by increased activity of PPARγ, increased expression of energy metabolism-related genes, and lowering of the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in the colon, the reduction of which is a marker for the correction of gut dysbiosis. Furthermore, these data were consistent with the American Gut Project wherein the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio of non-IBD (n=611) patients was significantly lower than patients with IBD (n=631). Conclusions 5-Aminosalicylic acid could be repurposed for hypertension by specifically enhancing the gut energy metabolism and correction of microbiota dysbiosis.

  Title: Repurposing a Drug Targeting Inflammatory Bowel Disease for Lowering Hypertension.
  Abstract: Background The gut and gut microbiota, which were previously neglected in blood pressure regulation, are becoming increasingly recognized as factors contributing to hypertension. Diseases affecting the gut such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) present with aberrant energy metabolism of colonic epithelium and gut dysbiosis, both of which are also mechanisms contributing to hypertension. We reasoned that current measures to remedy deficits in colonic energy metabolism and dysbiosis in IBD could also ameliorate hypertension. Among them, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA; mesalamine) is a PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) agonist. It attenuates IBD by a dual mechanism of selectively enhancing colonic epithelial cell energy metabolism and ameliorating gut dysbiosis. Methods and Results A total of 2 groups of 11- to 12-week-old male, hypertensive, Dahl salt-sensitive (S) rats were gavaged with (n=10) or without (n=10) 5-aminosalicylic acid (150 mg/kg) for 4 weeks. Rats receiving 5-aminosalicylic acid treatment had a lower mean blood pressure than controls (145±3 mm Hg versus 153±4 mm Hg; P<0.0001). This reduction in blood pressure was accompanied by increased activity of PPARγ, increased expression of energy metabolism-related genes, and lowering of the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in the colon, the reduction of which is a marker for the correction of gut dysbiosis. Furthermore, these data were consistent with the American Gut Project wherein the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio of non-IBD (n=611) patients was significantly lower than patients with IBD (n=631). Conclusions 5-Aminosalicylic acid could be repurposed for hypertension by specifically enhancing the gut energy metabolism and correction of microbiota dysbiosis.

  Title: Exposure to Thioguanine During 117 Pregnancies in Women With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Abstract: Safety of thioguanine in pregnant patients with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is sparsely recorded. This study was aimed to document the safety of thioguanine during pregnancy and birth.In this multicentre case series, IBD patients treated with thioguanine during pregnancy were included. Data regarding disease and medication history, pregnancy course, obstetric complications, and neonatal outcomes were collected.Data on 117 thioguanine-exposed pregnancies in 99 women were collected. Most [78%] had Crohn's disease and the mean age at delivery was 31 years. In 18 pregnancies [15%], IBD flared. Obstetric and infectious complications were seen in 15% [n = 17] and 7% [n = 8] of pregnancies, respectively. Ten pregnancies [8.5%] resulted in a first trimester miscarriage, one in a stillbirth at 22 weeks of gestational age and one in an induced abortion due to trisomy 21. In total, 109 neonates were born from 101 singleton pregnancies and four twin pregnancies. One child was born with a congenital abnormality [cleft palate]. In the singleton pregnancies, 10 children were born prematurely and 10 were born small for gestational age. Screening for myelosuppresion was performed in 16 neonates [14.7%]; two had anaemia in umbilical cord blood. All outcomes were comparable to either the general Dutch population or to data from three Dutch cohort studies on the use of conventional thiopurines in pregnant IBD patients.In this large case series, the use of thioguanine during pregnancy is not associated in excess with adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes.© The Author(s) 2022.

  Title: FXR mediates ILC-intrinsic responses to intestinal inflammation.
  Abstract: The pleiotropic actions of the Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) are required for gut health, and reciprocally, reduced intestinal FXR signaling is seen in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Here, we show that activation of FXR selectively in the intestine is protective in inflammation-driven models of IBD. Prophylactic activation of FXR restored homeostatic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, most notably IL17. Importantly, these changes were attributed to FXR regulation of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), with both the inflammation-driven increases in ILCs, and ILC3s in particular, and the induction of Il17a and Il17f  in ILC3s blocked by FXR activation. Moreover, a population of ILC precursor-like cells increased with treatment, implicating FXR in the maturation/differentiation of ILC precursors. These findings identify FXR as an intrinsic regulator of intestinal ILCs and a potential therapeutic target in inflammatory intestinal diseases.

  Title: Bifidobacterium bifidum FJSWX19M5 alleviated 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced chronic colitis by mitigating gut barrier injury and increasing regulatory T cells.
  Abstract: Probiotics have been evaluated as alternative approaches for preventing the relapse of Crohn's disease (CD). Previously, we observed strain-specific anti-inflammatory properties of Bifidobacterium bifidum in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) acute colitis models. In this study, we further assessed the effects of several B. bifidum strains on colonic damage, fibrosis, inflammatory factors, intestinal microbial and metabolic profiles, and peripheral regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the context of TNBS chronic colitis in mice. These results indicated that B. bifidum FJSWX19M5, but not FXJWS17M4, ameliorated body weight loss, reduced colonic shortening and injury, decreased markers of gut inflammation, and rebalanced colonic metabolism in TNBS-treated mice. FJSWX19M5 supplementation also promoted Treg cell differentiation and intestinal barrier restoration compared to other strains. All living B. bifidum strains (FJSWX19M5, FXJWS17M4 and FHENJZ3M6) seemed to restore the disruption of the gut microbiota caused by TNBS. The co-culture of B. bifidum strains and mesenteric lymph node cells from TNBS-treated mice showed that those strains with anti-colitis could induce higher IL-10 levels and a lower ratio of IL-22/IL-10 and IL-17/IL-10 when compared to those strains that were not protective. Furthermore, heat-killed FJSWX19M5 exhibited a relief effect on colitis-related symptoms (including body weight loss, colonic shortening and injury). These data imply that specific B. bifidum strains or their lysates may be the current therapeutic alternatives for CD.

  Title: Xianglian pill modulates gut microbial production of succinate and induces regulatory T cells to alleviate ulcerative colitis in rats.
  Abstract: Xianglian pill (XLP), a traditional Chinese formula, is widely used as treatment for ulcerative colitis (UC) in China. However, the mechanism of its therapeutic effect is still unclear.Our previous studies showed a low oral bioavailability and a predominant distribution of major XLP ingredients in the gut. In the present study, we aimed to explore the mechanism of action of XLP on UC with respect to the regulation of gut microecology.UC model rats established using 5% dextran sulfate sodium were treated with XLP. After the treatment period, bodyweight, colon length, histopathology, and inflammatory changes were evaluated. Further, changes in gut microbiota structure were detected via 16S rRNA sequencing, and microbial metabolites in feces were analyzed via a metabolomic assay. Antibiotic intervention and fecal microbiota transplantation were also employed to explore the involvement of gut microbiota, while the level of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in mesenteric lymph nodes was determined via flow cytometry. Transcriptome sequencing was also performed to determine colonic gene changes.XLP alleviated colonic injury, inflammation, and gut microbial dysbiosis in UC model rats and also changed microbial metabolite levels. Particularly, it significantly decreased succinate level in the tyrosine pathway. We also observed that fecal microbiota derived from XLP-treated rats conferred resilience to UC model rats. However, this therapeutic effect of XLP on UC was inhibited by succinate. Moreover, XLP increased the level of anti-inflammatory cellular Tregs via gut microbiota. However, this beneficial effect was counteracted by succinate supplementation. Further, XLP induced the differentiation of Treg possibly by the regulation of the PHD2/HIF-1α pathway via decreasing microbial succinate production.Our findings indicated that XLP exerts its therapeutic effects on UC mainly via the gut microbiota-succinate-Treg differentiation axis.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

  Title: DNA methylation of the TPMT gene and azathioprine pharmacokinetics in children with very early onset inflammatory bowel disease.
  Abstract: Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) is a crucial enzyme for azathioprine biotransformation and its activity is higher in very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) patients than in adolescents with IBD (aIBD).The aims of this pharmacoepigenetic study were to evaluate differences in peripheral blood DNA methylation of the TPMT gene and in azathioprine pharmacokinetics in patients with VEO-IBD compared to aIBD.The association of age with whole genome DNA methylation profile was evaluated in a pilot group of patients and confirmed by a meta-analysis on 3 cohorts of patients available on the public functional genomics data repository. Effects of candidate CpG sites in the TPMT gene were validated in a larger cohort using pyrosequencing. TPMT activity and azathioprine metabolites (TGN) were measured in patients' erythrocytes by HPLC and associated with patients' age group and TPMT DNA methylation.Whole genome DNA methylation pilot analysis, combined with the meta-analysis revealed cg22736354, located on TPMT downstream neighboring region, as the only statistically significant CpG whose methylation increases with age, resulting lower in VEO-IBD patients compared to aIBD (median 9.6% vs 12%, p = 0.029). Pyrosequencing confirmed lower cg22736354 methylation in VEO-IBD patients (median 4.0% vs 6.0%, p = 4.6 ×10-5). No differences in TPMT promoter methylation were found. Reduced cg22736354 methylation was associated with lower TGN concentrations (rho = 0.31, p = 0.01) in patients with VEO-IBD and aIBD.Methylation of cg22736354 in TPMT gene neighborhood is lower in patients with VEO-IBD and is associated with reduced azathioprine inactivation and increased TGN concentrations.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

  Title: Development and implementation of a laboratory monitoring dashboard to reduce treatment gaps in inflammatory bowel disease.
  Abstract: Patients receiving biologic therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) require routine laboratory monitoring to ensure the safety and efficacy of therapy. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to evaluate the implementation of a dashboard to prevent treatment gaps by prospectively identifying patients with IBD and outdated laboratory results receiving biologics.We performed a pre/post analysis of dashboard implementation to assess the number of patients with overdue laboratory work resulting in treatment gaps. The dashboard combined data from the electronic health record (EHR) and pharmacy claims database to identify patients on a biologic with laboratory tests (white blood cell count, liver transaminases, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) completed 5 or more months ago and/or a tuberculosis screen completed 11 or more months ago. After implementation, specialty pharmacists reviewed the dashboard and communicated via EHR if a new prescription and laboratory tests were needed. Messages were sent 4 weeks in advance of the next refill-eligible date. Mixed methods were used for analysis of qualitative data, including surveys, and quantitative data, assessing treatment gap length.A total of 40 patients who had outdated laboratory values and required a new prescription (15 before dashboard implementation and 25 after implementation) were included in the analysis. The frequency of a treatment gap decreased from 80% (n = 12) in the preimplementation phase to 32% (n = 8) in the postimplementation phase. The median gap length was shorter after dashboard implementation, decreasing from 21 days (range, 3-97 days) to 11 days (range, 2-23 days).Utilization of a quality measures dashboard decreased treatment gaps in patients with IBD receiving biologic therapy. Integrated specialty pharmacists are uniquely positioned to monitor adherence to laboratory monitoring parameters for patients on biologics.© American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2022.

  Title: Development and implementation of a laboratory monitoring dashboard to reduce treatment gaps in inflammatory bowel disease.
  Abstract: Patients receiving biologic therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) require routine laboratory monitoring to ensure the safety and efficacy of therapy. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to evaluate the implementation of a dashboard to prevent treatment gaps by prospectively identifying patients with IBD and outdated laboratory results receiving biologics.We performed a pre/post analysis of dashboard implementation to assess the number of patients with overdue laboratory work resulting in treatment gaps. The dashboard combined data from the electronic health record (EHR) and pharmacy claims database to identify patients on a biologic with laboratory tests (white blood cell count, liver transaminases, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) completed 5 or more months ago and/or a tuberculosis screen completed 11 or more months ago. After implementation, specialty pharmacists reviewed the dashboard and communicated via EHR if a new prescription and laboratory tests were needed. Messages were sent 4 weeks in advance of the next refill-eligible date. Mixed methods were used for analysis of qualitative data, including surveys, and quantitative data, assessing treatment gap length.A total of 40 patients who had outdated laboratory values and required a new prescription (15 before dashboard implementation and 25 after implementation) were included in the analysis. The frequency of a treatment gap decreased from 80% (n = 12) in the preimplementation phase to 32% (n = 8) in the postimplementation phase. The median gap length was shorter after dashboard implementation, decreasing from 21 days (range, 3-97 days) to 11 days (range, 2-23 days).Utilization of a quality measures dashboard decreased treatment gaps in patients with IBD receiving biologic therapy. Integrated specialty pharmacists are uniquely positioned to monitor adherence to laboratory monitoring parameters for patients on biologics.© American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2022.

  Title: Promoting Effect of L-Fucose on the Regeneration of Intestinal Stem Cells through AHR/IL-22 Pathway of Intestinal Lamina Propria Monocytes.
  Abstract: The recovery of the intestinal epithelial barrier is the goal for curing various intestinal injurious diseases, especially IBD. However, there are limited therapeutics for restoring intestinal epithelial barrier function in IBD. The stemness of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) can differentiate into various mature intestinal epithelial cells, thus playing a key role in the rapid regeneration of the intestinal epithelium. IL-22 secreted by CD4+ T cells and ILC3 cells was reported to maintain the stemness of ISCs. Our previous study found that L-fucose significantly ameliorated DSS-induced colonic inflammation and intestinal epithelial injury. In this study, we discovered enhanced ISC regeneration and increased intestinal IL-22 secretion and its related transcription factor AHR in colitis mice after L-fucose treatment. Further studies showed that L-fucose promoted IL-22 release from CD4+ T cells and intestinal lamina propria monocytes (LPMCs) via activation of nuclear AHR. The coculture system of LPMCs and intestinal organoids demonstrated that L-fucose stimulated the proliferation of ISCs through an indirect manner of IL-22 from LPMCs via the IL-22R-p-STAT3 pathway, and restored TNF-α-induced organoid damage via IL-22-IL-22R signaling. These results revealed that L-fucose helped to heal the epithelial barrier by accelerating ISC proliferation, probably through the AHR/IL-22 pathway of LPMCs, which provides a novel therapy for IBD in the clinic.

  Title: Beyond Neutrophils for Predicting Relapse and Remission in Ulcerative Colitis.
  Abstract: This study examines colonic histological features in ulcerative colitis [UC] in endoscopic remission to determine which cell types and biopsy sites best predict a patient's likelihood of remaining in remission.This is a retrospective chart, endoscopy and histology review of 166 patients with UC in endoscopic remission followed in a single inflammatory bowel disease practice over a median of 6 years [range, 2-11 years]. Clinical remission was based on global physician assessment and colonoscopy reports, and clinical relapse on chart review. Histological features of previous injury and also number and location of plasma cells and eosinophils were assessed. We evaluated all of these features semi-quantitatively using a standard set of illustrations for the grade to maintain consistency. Multiple logistic regression and survival analyses were used to identify features associated with relapse.Clinical relapse occurred in 44 patients. Ulceration, especially in the left colon, was highly predictive of relapse. In the absence of acute inflammation of ulceration, the variables most predictive of relapse were increased plasma cells in the basal 20% of the lamina propria, and eosinophils in the left colon. The variable most predictive of persistent remission was the presence of intra-epithelial eosinophils whether in the surface epithelium or within crypts, especially in the right colon. Lamina propria eosinophils [grade > 2] throughout the colon predicted relapse.In the absence of neutrophils or ulceration, left-sided plasmacytosis in the basal 20% of the lamina propria and increased lamina propria eosinophils provide the best indicators of relapse in UC in clinical and endoscopic remission.© The Author(s) 2022.

  Title: Targeting endoplasmic reticulum stress, Nrf-2/HO-1, and NF-κB by myristicin and its role in attenuation of ulcerative colitis in rats.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is characterized by the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators, apoptotic signals, and oxidative stress that can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer. The present study aims to investigate the possible role of myristicin in modulating endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and risk-associated conditions in acetic acid (AA)-induced UC.Adult male rats were treated with 150 mg/kg body weight of myristicin or mesalazine orally either as pre/post treatment or post-treatment only. The gene expression of glucose-related protein 78 (GRP78), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), percentage of DNA fragmentation, and serum levels of some oxidative and inflammatory markers were measured.The results indicated the potential upregulation of ERS, pro-apoptotic, lipid peroxidation, and pro-inflammatory cascades by induction of UC in rats. However, myristicin could effectively reverse the deteriorated effects of ulceration in colonic mucosa. It was mediated through downregulation of the ERS markers GRP78 and CHOP genes expression, reduction of NF-κB mRNA expression, DNA fragmentation, reduced lipid peroxidation, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and pro-inflammatory markers (Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and cyclo‑oxygenase (COX-2) activity). Accompanied by elevated levels of IL-10, colonic Nuclear erythroid factor (Nrf-2) and Heme oxygenase (HO-1) activity as well as blood antioxidant enzymes activity. Results of docking might confirm the biological results of our study.Myristicin could effectively modulate important stress, and inflammatory effectors and protect mucosal DNA from oxidative damage which can serve as a promising candidate for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

  Title: Masticadienonic acid from Chios mastic gum mitigates colitis in mice via modulating inflammatory response, gut barrier integrity and microbiota.
  Abstract: Chios mastic gum (CMG) is a traditional Greek medicine used to treat a variety of gastrointestinal disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the bioactive compounds of CMG and the mechanisms of action for controlling of IBD remain unknown.Masticadienonic acid (MDA) is one of the most abundant constituents isolated from CMG. This study aims to investigate the potential effects and underlying mechanisms of MDA in the pathogenesis of colitis.The effects of MDA were evaluated using a dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced acute colitis mouse model. The body and spleen weight and colon length and weight were measured and the clinical symptoms were analysed. Blood samples were collected to analyse the level of serum inflammatory markers. Colon tissues were processed for histopathological examination, evaluation of the epithelial barrier function, and investigation of the probable mechanisms of action. The gut microbiota composition was also studied to determine the mechanism for the beneficial effects of MDA on IBD.MDA could ameliorate the severity of IBD by increasing the body weight and colon length, reducing spleen weight, disease activity index, and histological score. MDA treatments reduce the release of serum inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) via inhibiting the MAPK and NF-κB signalling pathways. MDA supplementation could also improve the intestinal barrier function by activating the NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) signalling pathway and restoring the expression of tight junction proteins zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin. In addition, MDA administration modulates the gut microbiota composition in DSS-induced colitis mice.The results indicate that MDA attenuated experimental colitis by restoring intestinal barrier integrity, reducing inflammation, and modulating the gut microbiota. The present study provides novel insights into CMG-mediated remission of IBD and may facilitate the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies for IBD.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier GmbH.

  Title: Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Vedolizumab Following Administration of a Single Intravenous Dose in Healthy Chinese Subjects.
  Abstract: Vedolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD), that specifically binds to the α4β7 integrin. The aim of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of vedolizumab following a single intravenous (IV) infusion in healthy adult Chinese subjects.Sixteen participants received a single IV infusion of vedolizumab (300 mg). Blood samples were collected to measure vedolizumab serum concentrations. The safety of all subjects was monitored.The pharmacokinetic analysis showed that vedolizumab reached the maximum observed serum concentration (Cmax) at approximately 1.32 hours. The mean Cmax and area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC0-t) and to infinity (AUC0-∞) were 137.25 µg/mL, 2360 days·µg/mL, and 2395 days·µg/mL, respectively. The elimination of vedolizumab was relatively slow, with a mean terminal disposition phase half-life elimination (t1/2) of 20.23 days. Six subjects were positive for anti-vedolizumab antibodies (AVAs) on day 106 and day 127. Finally, 4 out of 16 subjects (25.0%) had treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), all of which were upper respiratory tract infections.Vedolizumab was well tolerated in healthy Chinese subjects when administered as a single-dose IV 300 mg infusion. In this study, the rate of AVA positivity was 37.5%, which occurred near the end of the study; no significant differences in pharmacokinetic profiles were observed between the AVA-positive and AVA-negative groups.http://www.chinadrugtrials.org.cn : CTR20171528.© 2022.

  Title: Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Vedolizumab Following Administration of a Single Intravenous Dose in Healthy Chinese Subjects.
  Abstract: Vedolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD), that specifically binds to the α4β7 integrin. The aim of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of vedolizumab following a single intravenous (IV) infusion in healthy adult Chinese subjects.Sixteen participants received a single IV infusion of vedolizumab (300 mg). Blood samples were collected to measure vedolizumab serum concentrations. The safety of all subjects was monitored.The pharmacokinetic analysis showed that vedolizumab reached the maximum observed serum concentration (Cmax) at approximately 1.32 hours. The mean Cmax and area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC0-t) and to infinity (AUC0-∞) were 137.25 µg/mL, 2360 days·µg/mL, and 2395 days·µg/mL, respectively. The elimination of vedolizumab was relatively slow, with a mean terminal disposition phase half-life elimination (t1/2) of 20.23 days. Six subjects were positive for anti-vedolizumab antibodies (AVAs) on day 106 and day 127. Finally, 4 out of 16 subjects (25.0%) had treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), all of which were upper respiratory tract infections.Vedolizumab was well tolerated in healthy Chinese subjects when administered as a single-dose IV 300 mg infusion. In this study, the rate of AVA positivity was 37.5%, which occurred near the end of the study; no significant differences in pharmacokinetic profiles were observed between the AVA-positive and AVA-negative groups.http://www.chinadrugtrials.org.cn : CTR20171528.© 2022.

  Title: Increased monocyte abundance as a marker for relapse after discontinuation of biologics in inflammatory bowel disease with deep remission.
  Abstract: Monocytes are involved in the upstream inflammatory process in the immune reaction in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Patients with IBD who discontinued biologics have been found to relapse, even after checking for deep remission. This study investigated whether monocytes could act as a predictor of relapse in patients who experienced relapse after the discontinuation of biologics. To this end, pediatric patients (<19 years old, n = 727) diagnosed with IBD from January 2003 to December 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical features, monocytes, and disease activity at the time of discontinuing biologics were evaluated by dividing patients into a relapsed group and a non-relapsed group after discontinuing biologics. The percentage of monocytes (8.65% vs. 6.42%, P < 0.001), the absolute monocyte count (614.79 cells/μL vs. 381.70 cells/μL, P < 0.001), and the monocyte/polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) ratio (0.18 vs. 0.11, P < 0.001) at the time of discontinuation were significantly higher in patients who experienced relapse. As a result of multivariate analysis, the monocyte percentage (odds ratio: 2.012, P < 0.001) and monocyte/PMN ratio (odds ratio: 4.320E+14, P = 0.002) were evaluated as risk factors for relapse. Diagnostic capability was confirmed using area under operating characteristic curve (0.782) of the monocyte percentage for assessing the relapse within 6 months with cutoff value of 8.15% (P < 0.001). The findings presented in this study indicate that the patients with high monocyte counts experienced relapse after the discontinuation of biologics. A monocyte percentage of over 8.15% in the blood at the time of discontinuation was found to be associated with a high probability of relapse within 6 months, even in deep remission.Copyright © 2022 Kwon, Kim, Choe and Kim.

  Title: Hydrolyzable Tannins in the Management of Th1, Th2 and Th17 Inflammatory-Related Diseases.
  Abstract: Plants rich in hydrolyzable tannins were traditionally used all over the world for a variety of chronic inflammatory disorders, including arthritis, colitis, and dermatitis. However, the knowledge of their immunological targets is still limited though fundamental for their rational use in phytotherapy. The recent advances regarding the pathogenesis of inflammatory-based diseases represent an opportunity to elucidate the pharmacological mechanism of plant-derived metabolites with immunomodulatory activity. This review collects recent articles regarding the role of hydrolyzable tannins and their gut metabolites in Th1, Th2, and Th17 inflammatory responses. In line with the traditional use, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), psoriasis, atopic dermatitis (AD), and asthma were the most investigated diseases. A substantial body of in vivo studies suggests that, beside innate response, hydrolyzable tannins may reduce the levels of Th-derived cytokines, including IFN-γ, IL-17, and IL-4, following oral administration. The mode of action is multitarget and may involve the impairment of inflammatory transcription factors (NF-κB, NFAT, STAT), enzymes (MAPKs, COX-2, iNOS), and ion channels. However, their potential impact on pathways with renewed interest for inflammation, such as JAK/STAT, or the modulation of the gut microbiota demands dedicate studies.

  Title: Pioglitazone Attenuates the Effects of Peripheral Inflammation in a Human In Vitro Blood-Brain Barrier Model.
  Abstract: Biological mediators secreted during peripheral chronic inflammation reach the bloodstream and may damage the blood-brain barrier (BBB), triggering central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Full-fledged human BBB models are efficient tools to investigate pharmacological pathways and mechanisms of injury at the BBB. We here employed a human in vitro BBB model to investigate the effects of either plasma from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients or tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), a cytokine commonly released in periphery during IBD, and the anti-inflammatory role of pioglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ agonist (PPARγ). The BBB model was treated with either 10% plasma from healthy and IBD donors or 5 ng/mL TNFα, following treatment with 10 µM pioglitazone. Patient plasma did not alter BBB parameters, but TNFα levels in plasma from all donors were associated with varying expression of claudin-5, claudin-3 and ICAM-1. TNFα treatment increased BBB permeability, claudin-5 disarrangement, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression, MCP1 secretion and monocyte transmigration. These effects were attenuated by pioglitazone. Plasma from IBD patients, which evoked higher BBB permeability, also increased ICAM-1 expression, this effect being reversed by pioglitazone. Our findings evidence how pioglitazone controls periphery-elicited BBB inflammation and supports its repurposing for prevention/treating of such inflammatory conditions.

  Title: Curcumin alleviates experimental colitis via a potential mechanism involving memory B cells and Bcl-6-Syk-BLNK signaling.
  Abstract: Immune dysfunction is the crucial cause in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is mainly related to lymphocytes (T or B cells, incl-uding memory B cells), mast cells, activated neutrophils, and macrophages. As the precursor of B cells, the activation of memory B cells can trigger and differentiate B cells to produce a giant variety of inducible B cells and tolerant B cells, whose dysfunction can easily lead to autoimmune diseases, including IBD.To investigate whether or not curcumin (Cur) can alleviate experimental colitis by regulating memory B cells and Bcl-6-Syk-BLNK signaling.Colitis was induced in mice with a dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) solution in drinking water. Colitis mice were given Cur (100 mg/kg/d) orally for 14 con-secutive days. The colonic weight, colonic length, intestinal weight index, occult blood scores, and histological scores of mice were examined to evaluate the curative effect. The levels of memory B cells in peripheral blood of mice were measured by flow cytometry, and IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-7A, and TNF-α expression in colonic tissue homogenates were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Western blot was used to measure the expression of Bcl-6, BLNK, Syk, and other signaling pathway related proteins.After Cur treatment for 14 d, the body weight, colonic weight, colonic length, colonic weight index, and colonic pathological injury of mice with colitis were ameliorated. The secretion of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-7A was statistically decreased, while the IL-35 and IL-10 levels were considerably increased. Activation of memory B cell subsets in colitis mice was confirmed by a remarkable reduction in the expression of IgM, IgG, IgA, FCRL5, CD103, FasL, PD-1, CD38, and CXCR3 on the surface of CD19+ CD27+ B cells, while the number of CD19+ CD27+ IL-10+ and CD19+ CD27+ Tim-3+ B cells increased significantly. In addition, Cur significantly inhibited the protein levels of Syk, p-Syk, Bcl-6, and CIN85, and increased BLNK and p-BLNK expression in colitis mice.Cur could effectively alleviate DSS-induced colitis in mice by regulating memory B cells and the Bcl-6-Syk-BLNK signaling pathway.©The Author(s) 2022.

  Title: Polysaccharide from Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz. ameliorates DSS-induced colitis in mice by regulating the Th17/Treg cell balance.
  Abstract: Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz. is one of the most frequently used traditional Chinese medicines for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). The beneficial effect of polysaccharide from Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz. (PAMK) on UC has been reported, while the underlying mechanism and target remain unclear. In this study, we systematically investigated the therapeutic effect and the underlying mechanism of PAMK in UC based on a mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. PAMK treatment (100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated DSS-induced colitis, manifested as a reduction in weight loss, disease activity index (DAI), colon shortening, spleen index and histological score. Moreover, PAMK treatment inhibited inflammation and improved the integrity of the intestinal barrier in colitis mice. Mechanistically, microarray analysis determined the critical role of the immunoregulatory effect of PAMK in alleviating UC. Flow cytometry analysis further demonstrated that PAMK treatment regulated the balance between T helper (Th) 17 and regulatory T (Treg) cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and spleen in mice with colitis. In addition, PAMK treatment downregulated the expression of IL-6 and suppressed the phosphorylation of STAT3. Together, these data revealed that PAMK treatment alleviated DSS-induced colitis by regulating the Th17/Treg cell balance, which may be dependent on the inhibition of the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway. Our study is the first to elucidate that the underlying mechanism by which PAMK treatment alleviates DSS-induced colitis is associated with an improved the Th17/Treg cell balance. Collectively, the study provides evidence for the potential of PAMK to treat UC.Copyright © 2022 Yang, Zhang, Taha, Abdelmotalab, Wen, Yuan, Zhao, Li, Liao, Huang, Jiang, Chu, Jiao and Sun.

  Title: Systemic and T cell-associated responses to SARS-CoV-2 immunisation in gut inflammation (STAR SIGN study): effects of biologics on vaccination efficacy of the third dose of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
  Abstract: Immunosuppressed patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) experience increased risk of vaccine-preventable diseases such as COVID-19.To assess humoral and cellular immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 booster vaccination in immunosuppressed IBD patients and healthy controls.In this prospective, multicentre, case-control study, 139 IBD patients treated with biologics and 110 healthy controls were recruited. Serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG concentrations were measured 2-16 weeks after receiving a third mRNA vaccine dose. The primary outcome was to determine if humoral immune responses towards booster vaccines differ in IBD patients under anti-TNF versus non-anti-TNF therapy and healthy controls. Secondary outcomes were antibody decline, impact of previous infection and SARS-CoV-2-targeted T cell responses.Anti-TNF-treated IBD patients showed reduced anti-spike IgG concentrations (geometric mean 2357.4 BAU/ml [geometric SD 3.3]) when compared to non-anti-TNF-treated patients (5935.7 BAU/ml [3.9]; p < 0.0001) and healthy controls (5481.7 BAU/ml [2.4]; p < 0.0001), respectively. In multivariable modelling, prior infection (geometric mean ratio 2.00 [95% CI 1.34-2.90]) and vaccination with mRNA-1273 (1.53 [1.01-2.27]) increased antibody concentrations, while anti-TNF treatment (0.39 [0.28-0.54]) and prolonged time between vaccination and antibody measurement (0.72 [0.58-0.90]) decreased anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies. Antibody decline was comparable in IBD patients independent of anti-TNF treatment and antibody concentrations could not predict breakthrough infections. Cellular and humoral immune responses were uncoupled, and more anti-TNF-treated patients than healthy controls developed inadequate T cell responses (15/73 [20.5%] vs 2/100 [2.0%]; p = 0.00031).Anti-TNF-treated IBD patients have impaired humoral and cellular immunogenicity following SARS-CoV-2 booster vaccination. Fourth dose administration may be beneficial for these patients.© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

  Title: Correlation of Macrophages with Inflammatory Reaction in Ulcerative Colitis and Influence of Curcumin on Macrophage Chemotaxis.
  Abstract: Our study aimed to elucidate the correlation of macrophage (mø) with the inflammatory reaction in ulcerative colitis (UC) and the influence of curcumin (Cur) on mø chemotaxis in mice with UC.A total of 49 patients with UC (research group; RG) admitted between June 2020 and October 2021 and 56 healthy individuals (control group; CG) who visited concurrently were selected as the study participants. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were analyzed, and M1-type/M2-type mø and inflammatory factors (IFs) interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) were detected. In addition, 15 BALB/c mice were purchased and divided into the normal group fed normally, the UC model group established with sodium dextran sulfate (DSS) and the Cur group induced by DSS + Cur feeding. Colon tissue mø was collected from mice to measure mø activity via CCK-8 and to quantify levels of IFs and chemokine CCL2 by polymer chain reaction (PCR)c and Western blotting.The RG had a higher percentage of peripheral blood M1-type mø and a lower percentage of M2-type mø and M1/M2 mø ratio than the CG (P < .05). In the RG, IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α all increased and were inversely correlated with the ratio of M1/M2 mø, while IL-10 and TGF-β decreased, with a positive connection with the M1/M2 mø ratio. In the UC model mice, mø activity increased, but the apoptosis rate decreased. mø activity was lower in the Cur group than in the model and normal groups; mø apoptosis in the Cur group was higher than in the model group but lower than in the normal group. In addition, proIFs increased and anti-IFs decreased in the model group, and Cur also ameliorated this process. Finally, CCL2 and MCP-1 levels in the model group were also increased, while those in the Cur group were lower compared with the model group.In UC, the M1/M2 mø ratio is severely misadjusted, activation of M1-type mø is enhanced and pro-IFs are released in large quantities. Cur can ameliorate the abnormal activation of mø in mice with UC, inhibit mø chemotaxis and alleviate the inflammatory reaction, which may make it a new option for UC treatment in the future.

  Title: Berberine Depresses Inflammation and Adjusts Smooth Muscle to Ameliorate Ulcerative Colitis of Cats by Regulating Gut Microbiota.
  Abstract: Intestinal microbiota dysbiosis is a well established characteristic of ulcerative colitis (UC). Regulating the gut microbiota is an effective UC treatment strategy. Berberine (BBR), an alkaloid extracted from several Chinese herbs, is a common traditional Chinese medicine. To establish the efficacy and mechanism of action of BBR, we constructed a UC model using healthy adult shorthair cats to conduct a systematic study of colonic tissue pathology, inflammatory factor expression, and gut microbiota structure. We investigated the therapeutic capacity of BBR for regulating the gut microbiota and thus work against UC in cats using 16S rRNA genes amplicon sequencing technology. Our results revealed that dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced cat models of UC showed weight loss, diarrhea accompanied by mucous and blood, histological abnormalities, and shortening of the colon, all of which were significantly alleviated by supplementation with BBR. A 16S rRNA gene-based microbiota analysis demonstrated that BBR could significantly benefit gut microbiota. Western blot, quantitative PCR, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) showed that in DSS-induced cat models, the expression of the inflammatory factors was increased, activating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, and treatment with BBR reversed this effect. The myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation in the smooth muscle of the intestines is associated with motility of inflammation-related diarrhea in cats. This study used gut flora analyses to demonstrate the anti-UC effects of BBR and its potential therapeutic mechanisms and offers novel insights into the prevention of inflammatory diseases using natural products. IMPORTANCE Ulcerative colitis (UC) is common in clinics. Intestinal microbiota disorder is correlated with ulcerative colitis. Although there are many studies on ulcerative colitis in rats, there are few studies on colitis in cats. Therefore, this study explored the possibility of the use of BBR as a safe and efficient treatment for colitis in cats. The results demonstrated the therapeutic effects of BBR on UC based on the state of the intestinal flora. The study found BBR supplementation to be effective against dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, smooth muscle damage, and gut microbiota dysbiosis.

  Title: Combination Therapy With Immunomodulators Improves the Pharmacokinetics of Infliximab But Not Vedolizumab or Ustekinumab.
  Abstract: The aim of this study was to assess how 6-thioguanine nucleotide (6-TGN) levels and use of oral methotrexate relate to the pharmacokinetics of biologics.This was a prospective cohort study including patients with inflammatory bowel diseases on maintenance doses of infliximab, vedolizumab, or ustekinumab on monotherapy or combination with a thiopurine or oral methotrexate. We collected 6-TGN concentrations, biomarker levels, and clinical and endoscopic disease activity. The primary outcomes were infliximab, vedolizumab, and ustekinumab concentrations as well as anti-drug antibodies (ADAs).A total of 369 patients were recruited (113 infliximab, 133 vedolizumab, and 123 ustekinumab). Patients with 6-TGN levels ≥146 pmol per 8 × 108 red blood cells (RBCs), and those receiving combination therapy with thiopurine or oral methotrexate had significantly higher infliximab concentrations when compared with monotherapy (median levels of 17.4 μg/mL on thiopurine with 6-TGN ≥146 pmol per 8 × 108 RBCs, 17.1 on methotrexate, and 3.9 on infliximab monotherapy; P = .001 for both comparisons). However, there was no association between the use of immunomodulators and 6-TGN concentrations with vedolizumab (median levels of 8.8 on thiopurine with 6-TGN ≥152 pmol per 8 × 108 RBCs, 6.8 on methotrexate, and 10.5 on vedolizumab monotherapy; P > .05 for both comparisons) or ustekinumab median concentrations (median levels of 5.0 on thiopurine with 6-TGN ≥154 pmol per 8 × 108 RBCs, 5.2 on methotrexate and 7.0 on ustekinumab monotherapy; P > .05 for both comparisons). Fourteen (12%) patients had anti-infliximab antibodies, while 1 patient had ADAs in each of the other drug cohorts.Achieving higher 6-TGN levels or the use of methotrexate improved the pharmacokinetics of infliximab. Conversely, these data do not support the use of combination therapy to augment pharmacokinetics with vedolizumab or ustekinumab.Copyright © 2022 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

  Title: Xanthohumol microbiome and signature in adults with Crohn's disease (the XMaS trial): a protocol for a phase II triple-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
  Abstract: Xanthohumol (XN), a bioactive flavonoid from Humulus lupulus with anti-inflammatory properties, has potential benefits for patients with Crohn's disease (CD), a type of inflammatory bowel disease. We recently completed and published results of a placebo-controlled phase I clinical trial demonstrating the safety and tolerability of 24 mg XN daily for 8 weeks. The present study aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the same dose of XN adults with clinically active CD in a placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial. Additional aims will assess the impact of XN on inflammatory biomarkers, platelet function, CD clinical activity, and stool microbial composition. The metabolism of XN will also be evaluated. This article provides a model protocol for consideration in investigations of XN or other natural products in disease states.A triple-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trial will be conducted in adults with clinically active CD. Participants (n ≤ 32) will be randomized to either 24 mg encapsulated XN per day or placebo and followed for 8 weeks. Throughout the trial, participants will be queried for adverse events. Biomarkers of clinical safety, blood and stool markers of inflammation, platelet function, Crohn's Disease Activity Index score, stool microbial composition, and XN metabolite profiles in blood, urine, and stool will be assessed every 2 weeks.We describe the protocol for a phase II clinical trial that evaluates the safety and tolerability of XN in adults with active CD, as well as evaluate metabolism and mechanisms that are relevant to CD and other diseases with underlying inflammation and/or gut permeability. The effects of XN on inflammatory biomarkers, platelet function, the microbiota, and multi-omics biomarkers measured in this phase II trial of adults with CD will be compared to the effects of XN in healthy adults in our previous phase I trial. The results of the study will advance the evidence guiding the use of XN in patients with CD.ClinialTrials.gov NCT04590508. Registered on October 19, 2020.© 2022. The Author(s).

  Title: Xanthohumol microbiome and signature in adults with Crohn's disease (the XMaS trial): a protocol for a phase II triple-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
  Abstract: Xanthohumol (XN), a bioactive flavonoid from Humulus lupulus with anti-inflammatory properties, has potential benefits for patients with Crohn's disease (CD), a type of inflammatory bowel disease. We recently completed and published results of a placebo-controlled phase I clinical trial demonstrating the safety and tolerability of 24 mg XN daily for 8 weeks. The present study aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the same dose of XN adults with clinically active CD in a placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial. Additional aims will assess the impact of XN on inflammatory biomarkers, platelet function, CD clinical activity, and stool microbial composition. The metabolism of XN will also be evaluated. This article provides a model protocol for consideration in investigations of XN or other natural products in disease states.A triple-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trial will be conducted in adults with clinically active CD. Participants (n ≤ 32) will be randomized to either 24 mg encapsulated XN per day or placebo and followed for 8 weeks. Throughout the trial, participants will be queried for adverse events. Biomarkers of clinical safety, blood and stool markers of inflammation, platelet function, Crohn's Disease Activity Index score, stool microbial composition, and XN metabolite profiles in blood, urine, and stool will be assessed every 2 weeks.We describe the protocol for a phase II clinical trial that evaluates the safety and tolerability of XN in adults with active CD, as well as evaluate metabolism and mechanisms that are relevant to CD and other diseases with underlying inflammation and/or gut permeability. The effects of XN on inflammatory biomarkers, platelet function, the microbiota, and multi-omics biomarkers measured in this phase II trial of adults with CD will be compared to the effects of XN in healthy adults in our previous phase I trial. The results of the study will advance the evidence guiding the use of XN in patients with CD.ClinialTrials.gov NCT04590508. Registered on October 19, 2020.© 2022. The Author(s).

  Title: G9a Modulates Lipid Metabolism in CD4 T Cells to Regulate Intestinal Inflammation.
  Abstract: Although T-cell intrinsic expression of G9a has been associated with murine intestinal inflammation, mechanistic insight into the role of this methyltransferase in human T-cell differentiation is ill defined, and manipulation of G9a function for therapeutic use against inflammatory disorders is unexplored.Human naive T cells were isolated from peripheral blood and differentiated in vitro in the presence of a G9a inhibitor (UNC0642) before being characterized via the transcriptome (RNA sequencing), chromatin accessibility (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin by sequencing), protein expression (cytometry by time of flight, flow cytometry), metabolism (mitochondrial stress test, ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mas spectroscopy) and function (T-cell suppression assay). The in vivo role of G9a was assessed using 3 murine models.We discovered that pharmacologic inhibition of G9a enzymatic function in human CD4 T cells led to spontaneous generation of FOXP3+ T cells (G9a-inibitors-T regulatory cells [Tregs]) in vitro that faithfully reproduce human Tregs, functionally and phenotypically. Mechanistically, G9a inhibition altered the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis in T cells, resulting in increased intracellular cholesterol. Metabolomic profiling of G9a-inibitors-Tregs confirmed elevated lipid pathways that support Treg development through oxidative phosphorylation and enhanced lipid membrane composition. Pharmacologic G9a inhibition promoted Treg expansion in vivo upon antigen (gliadin) stimulation and ameliorated acute trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis secondary to tissue-specific Treg development. Finally, Tregs lacking G9a expression (G9a-knockout Tregs) remain functional chronically and can rescue T-cell transfer-induced colitis.G9a inhibition promotes cholesterol metabolism in T cells, favoring a metabolic profile that facilitates Treg development in vitro and in vivo. Our data support the potential use of G9a inhibitors in the treatment of immune-mediated conditions including inflammatory bowel disease.Copyright © 2023 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

  Title: Rationale and design of a multicenter randomized clinical trial of vestibulodynia: understanding pathophysiology and determining appropriate treatments (vestibulodynia: UPDATe).
  Abstract: Limited data are available to establish evidence-based management protocols for vestibulodynia (VBD), a chronic vulvar pain condition that affects approximately 14 million women in the U.S. For the purposes of the study, our group subdivided VBD subtypes that may benefit from different types of treatment: 1) VBD peripheral (VBD-p), characterized by pain localized to the vulvar vestibule and 2) VBD central (VBD-c), characterized by VBD alongside one or more other chronic overlapping pain conditions (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, temporomandibular disorder, and fibromyalgia syndrome) that affect remote body regions. Here, we describe the rationale and design of an NIH-funded multicenter clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of topical and/or systemic medication for alleviating pain and normalizing pain- relevant biomarkers among women with VBD-p and VBD-c.Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four parallel arms: peripheral treatment with 5% lidocaine + 0.5 mg/ml 0.02% oestradiol compound cream + oral placebo pill, 2) central treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline + placebo cream, 3) combined peripheral cream and central pill treatments, or 4) placebo cream and placebo pill. The treatment phase will last 16 weeks, with outcome measures and biomarkers assessed at 4 time points (0, 8, 16, and 24 weeks). First, we will compare the efficacy of treatments in alleviating pain using standardized tampon insertion with a numeric rating scale and self-reported pain on the short form McGill Pain Questionnaire. Next, we will compare the efficacy of treatments in improving perceived physical, mental, and sexual health using standardized questionnaires. Finally, we will measure cytokines and microRNAs in local vaginal and circulating blood samples using multiplex assays and RNA sequencing, and determine the ability of these biomarkers to predict treatment response.This is the first multicenter randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of peripherally and centrally acting medications currently used in clinical practice for treating unique VBD subtypes based on distinct clinical and biological signatures.Vestibulodynia UPDATe is a multi-centre, two-by-two factorial designed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial registered at clinical trials.gov (NCT03844412). This work is supported by the R01 HD096331 awarded to Drs. Nackley, Rapkin, Geller and Carey by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).Key messagesPeripheral lidocaine and oestradiol and centrally-targeted nortriptyline medications are used for the treatment of pain in women with VBD, but there is a lack of data from well-powered RCTs.This two-by-two factorial RCT will test the efficacy of these medications

  Title: Identification of environmental factors that promote intestinal inflammation.
  Abstract: Genome-wide association studies have identified risk loci linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)1-a complex chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. The increasing prevalence of IBD in industrialized countries and the augmented disease risk observed in migrants who move into areas of higher disease prevalence suggest that environmental factors are also important determinants of IBD susceptibility and severity2. However, the identification of environmental factors relevant to IBD and the mechanisms by which they influence disease has been hampered by the lack of platforms for their systematic investigation. Here we describe an integrated systems approach, combining publicly available databases, zebrafish chemical screens, machine learning and mouse preclinical models to identify environmental factors that control intestinal inflammation. This approach established that the herbicide propyzamide increases inflammation in the small and large intestine. Moreover, we show that an AHR-NF-κB-C/EBPβ signalling axis operates in T cells and dendritic cells to promote intestinal inflammation, and is targeted by propyzamide. In conclusion, we developed a pipeline for the identification of environmental factors and mechanisms of pathogenesis in IBD and, potentially, other inflammatory diseases.© 2022.

  Title: Optimizing thiopurine therapy in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia: A promising "MINT" sequencing strategy and therapeutic "DNA-TG" monitoring.
  Abstract: Thiopurines, including thioguanine (TG), 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), and azathioprine (AZA), are extensively used in clinical practice in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and inflammatory bowel diseases. However, the common adverse effects caused by myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity limit their application. Metabolizing enzymes such as thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15), inosine triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase (ITPA), and drug transporters like multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 (MRP4) have been reported to mediate the metabolism and transportation of thiopurine drugs. Hence, the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in those genes could theoretically affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects of these drugs, and might also become one of the determinants of clinical efficacy and adverse effects. Moreover, long-term clinical practices have confirmed that thiopurine-related adverse reactions are associated with the systemic concentrations of their active metabolites. In this review, we mainly summarized the pharmacogenetic studies of thiopurine drugs. We also evaluated the therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) research studies and focused on those active metabolites, hoping to continuously improve monitoring strategies for thiopurine therapy to maximize therapeutic efficacy and minimize the adverse effects or toxicity. We proposed that tailoring thiopurine dosing based on MRP4, ITPA, NUDT15, and TMPT genotypes, defined as "MINT" panel sequencing strategy, might contribute toward improving the efficacy and safety of thiopurines. Moreover, the DNA-incorporated thioguanine nucleotide (DNA-TG) metabolite level was more suitable for red cell 6-thioguanine nucleotide (6-TGNs) monitoring, which can better predict the efficacy and safety of thiopurines. Integrating the panel "MINT" sequencing strategy with therapeutic "DNA-TG" monitoring would offer a new insight into the precision thiopurine therapy for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients.Copyright © 2022 Guo, Zhao, Wang, Dong, Hu, Zhang, Chen, Zhou and Li.

  Title: Effect of ozone versus naringin on testicular injury in experimentally induced ulcerative colitis in adult male albino rats.
  Abstract: Testicular dysfunction is caused by the continuous inflammation and oxidative stress that are present at the local site in ulcerative colitis (UC) spreading to the testes via systemic circulation. The influence of ozone and naringine on colitis-mediated testicular dysfunction was investigated in this study. Forty-eight adult male rats were divided into four groups: I control group, II dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) UC-induced group, III DSS+naringine, and IV DSS+ozone groups. UC was induced in groups II, III, and IV using 0.1 ml of 4% DSS in their drinking water per day for 6 days by gastric gavage. All animals were sacrificed 45 days from the start. Blood samples were obtained to estimate serum testosterone hormone. Testicular tissues were processed for measurement of tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) and examined by light and electron microscopes. Ultrastructurally, group II revealed a relatively thick basement membrane enveloping the seminiferous tubule. Sertoli cell cytoplasm appears rarified with wide intracellular spaces, vacuoles, and multiple lysosomes; distorted spermatogonia with electron dense nuclei and cytoplasm; and primary spermatocytes with small nuclei and electron dense cytoplasm. Abnormal sperm profiles were visible in middle pieces, mid, principle, and end pieces that were markedly affected with disorganization of axoneme and outer dense fibers. Leydig cells revealed dilated cisternae of smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Morphometric and statistical analyses were performed. Group III showed some improvement; however, group IV showed more improvement. The results indicated that ozone caused marked improvement than naringine against UC-induced testicular damage via their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

  Title: Low Risk of Lymphoma in Pediatric Patients Treated for Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Abstract: Despite the effectiveness of immune-suppressing therapies in treating pediatric inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), concerns of lymphoma may limit their use. We used a large administrative claims database to evaluate the risk of lymphoma in pediatric IBD and conducted a case series analysis of medication exposure in children diagnosed with lymphoma.We analyzed administrative claims from the 2007 to 2018 IQVIA database and identified pediatric (≤18 years) patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis using International Classification of Diseases, 9th or 10th Revision codes and pharmacy claims. Lymphoma cases were identified by diagnosis codes and confirmed by independent claim-by-claim review by a pediatric oncologist and gastroenterologist. We calculated incidence rates for lymphoma among patients with and without pharmacy claims for treatment followed by treatment description among those who developed lymphoma during follow-up.A total of 10,777 pediatric patients with IBD received ≥1 IBD therapy (median age 15 years [12-17], 45% female and 61% diagnosed with Crohn's disease) during 28,292 patient-years of follow-up. Among treated patients, 5 lymphoma cases were identified (incidence rate 17.7/100,000 patient-years; 95% confidence interval 6.5-39.2). Of these, 4 were treated with a thiopurine before lymphoma diagnosis, and none received anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF) monotherapy.The overall lymphoma incidence was low among our cohort of treated pediatric patients with IBD. We observed no cases of lymphoma among patients prescribed anti-TNF monotherapy. These findings reinforce the relative safety of anti-TNF monotherapy for the treatment of pediatric IBD.Copyright © 2022 by The American College of Gastroenterology.

  Title: Low Risk of Lymphoma in Pediatric Patients Treated for Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Abstract: Despite the effectiveness of immune-suppressing therapies in treating pediatric inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), concerns of lymphoma may limit their use. We used a large administrative claims database to evaluate the risk of lymphoma in pediatric IBD and conducted a case series analysis of medication exposure in children diagnosed with lymphoma.We analyzed administrative claims from the 2007 to 2018 IQVIA database and identified pediatric (≤18 years) patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis using International Classification of Diseases, 9th or 10th Revision codes and pharmacy claims. Lymphoma cases were identified by diagnosis codes and confirmed by independent claim-by-claim review by a pediatric oncologist and gastroenterologist. We calculated incidence rates for lymphoma among patients with and without pharmacy claims for treatment followed by treatment description among those who developed lymphoma during follow-up.A total of 10,777 pediatric patients with IBD received ≥1 IBD therapy (median age 15 years [12-17], 45% female and 61% diagnosed with Crohn's disease) during 28,292 patient-years of follow-up. Among treated patients, 5 lymphoma cases were identified (incidence rate 17.7/100,000 patient-years; 95% confidence interval 6.5-39.2). Of these, 4 were treated with a thiopurine before lymphoma diagnosis, and none received anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF) monotherapy.The overall lymphoma incidence was low among our cohort of treated pediatric patients with IBD. We observed no cases of lymphoma among patients prescribed anti-TNF monotherapy. These findings reinforce the relative safety of anti-TNF monotherapy for the treatment of pediatric IBD.Copyright © 2022 by The American College of Gastroenterology.

  Title: Hypertension as a rare adverse effect caused by infliximab in the treatment of Crohn's disease: a case report.
  Abstract: Infliximab is an effective drug for the treatment of Crohn's disease. As a rare and unique adverse effect of infliximab, hypertension should be paid enough attention in clinical work. At present, there is no relevant case report. We report a case of a 38-year-old man with Crohn's disease who had no history of hypertension and developed hypertension symptoms during infliximab treatment.The patient was treated with 5 mg/kg infliximab on August 27, 2020. From August 27, 2020 to October 20, 2020, the patient underwent 3 treatment sessions. After each injection of infliximab, the patient's blood pressure became elevated, accompanied by dizziness and symmetrical numbness of both lower limbs. Amlodipine benazepril tablets were given orally to control blood pressure. Under close monitoring, 5 mg/kg infliximab was used again. After 10 min of infusion, blood pressure rose to 160/118 mmHg. Infusion was discontinued immediately, after which blood pressure decreased to normal. Adrenal computed tomography did not indicate adrenal hyperplasia or space occupying lesions, and the detection of hypertension related indicators in standing and supine position was abnormal. Since follow up, the patient has stopped using infliximab and has had no hypertension-related symptoms, even without antihypertensives. Measured blood pressure was within the normal range.Hypertension, as one of the rare adverse reactions of infliximab in the treatment of Crohn's disease, should be paid enough attention.

  Title: Effect of curcumin on regulatory B cells in chronic colitis mice involving TLR/MyD88 signaling pathway.
  Abstract: Curcumin (Cur) is a natural active phenolic compound extracted from the root of Curcuma Longa L. It has anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor and other pharmacological activities, and is commonly used to treat ulcerative colitis (UC). However, it is not clear whether curcumin regulates the function and differentiation of Breg cells to treat UC. In this study, mice with chronic colitis were induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), and treated with curcumin for 12 days. Curcumin effectively improved the body weight, colonic weight, colonic length, decreased colonic weight index and pathological injury score under colonoscopy in mice with chronic colitis, and significantly inhibited the production of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-33, CCL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and promoted the secretion of IL-4, IL-10, IL-13 and IgA. Importantly, curcumin markedly upregulated CD3- CD19+ CD1d+ , CD3- CD19+ CD25+ , CD3- CD19+ Foxp3+ Breg cells level and significantly down-regulated CD3- CD19+ PD-L1+ , CD3- CD19+ tim-1+ , CD3- CD19+ CD27+ Breg cells level. In addition, our results also showed that curcumin observably inhibited TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, MyD88, IRAK4, p-IRAK4, NF-κB P65, IRAK1, TRAF6, TAB1, TAB2, TAK1, MKK3, MKK6, p38MAPK, p-p38MAPK and CREB expression in TLR/MyD88 signaling pathway. These results suggest that curcumin can regulate the differentiation and function of Breg cell to alleviate DSS-induced colitis, which may be realized by inhibiting TLR/MyD88 pathway.© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

  Title: Interleukin-22 regulates neutrophil recruitment in ulcerative colitis and is associated with resistance to ustekinumab therapy.
  Abstract: The function of interleukin-22 (IL-22) in intestinal barrier homeostasis remains controversial. Here, we map the transcriptional landscape regulated by IL-22 in human colonic epithelial organoids and evaluate the biological, functional and clinical significance of the IL-22 mediated pathways in ulcerative colitis (UC). We show that IL-22 regulated pro-inflammatory pathways are involved in microbial recognition, cancer and immune cell chemotaxis; most prominently those involving CXCR2+ neutrophils. IL-22-mediated transcriptional regulation of CXC-family neutrophil-active chemokine expression is highly conserved across species, is dependent on STAT3 signaling, and is functionally and pathologically important in the recruitment of CXCR2+ neutrophils into colonic tissue. In UC patients, the magnitude of enrichment of the IL-22 regulated transcripts in colonic biopsies correlates with colonic neutrophil infiltration and is enriched in non-responders to ustekinumab therapy. Our data provide further insights into the biology of IL-22 in human disease and highlight its function in the regulation of pathogenic immune pathways, including neutrophil chemotaxis. The transcriptional networks regulated by IL-22 are functionally and clinically important in UC, impacting patient trajectories and responsiveness to biological intervention.© 2022. The Author(s).

  Title: Qingchang Wenzhong Decoction reduce ulcerative colitis in mice by inhibiting Th17 lymphocyte differentiation.
  Abstract: Qingchang Wenzhong Decoction (QCWZD), a chinese herbal prescription, is widely used for ulcerative colitis (UC). Nevertheless, the active ingredients and mechanism of QCWZD in UC have not yet been explained clearly.This research focuses on the identification of the effective ingredients of QCWZD and the prediction and verification of their potential targets.The UC mice were established by adding 3.0% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to sterile water for one week. Concurrently, mice in the treatment group were gavage QCWZD or mesalazine. LC-MS analyzed the main components absorbed after QCWZD treatment, and network pharmacology predicted their possible targets. ELISA, qPCR, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence experiments were used to evaluate the colonic inflammation level and the intestinal barrier completeness. The percentage of Th17 and Treg lymphocytes was detected by flow cytometry.After QCWZD treatment, twenty-seven compounds were identified from the serum. In addition, QCWZD treatment significantly reduced the increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) and inflammatory cell infiltration caused by DSS in the colonic. In addition, QCWZD can reduce the secretion of inflammatory factors in serum and promote the expression of mRNAs and proteins of occludin and ZO-1. Network pharmacology analysis indicated that inhibiting IL-6-STAT3 pathway may be necessary for QCWZD to treat UC. Flow cytometry analysis showed that QCWZD can restore the normal proportion of Th17 lymphocytes in UC mice. Mechanistically, QCWZD inhibited the phosphorylation of JAK2-STAT3 pathway, reducing the transcriptional activation of RORγT and IL-17A.Overall, for the first time, our work revealed the components of QCWZD absorbed into blood, indicated that the effective ingredients of QCWZD may inhibit IL-6-STAT3 pathway and inhibit the differentiation of Th17 lymphocytes to reduce colon inflammation.Copyright © 2022.

  Title: How to place the duality of specific MMP-9 inhibition for treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases into clinical opportunities?
  Abstract: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) with the involvement of immune cells and molecules, including cytokines, chemokines and proteases. A previous extensive review about the molecular biology of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (TIMPs), related to intestinal barrier destruction and restoration functions in IBD, is here complemented with the literature from the last five years. We also compare IBD as a prototypic mucosal inflammation of an epithelial barrier against microorganisms with inflammatory retinopathy as a disease with a barrier dysfunction at the level of blood vessels. Multiple reasons are at the basis of halting clinical trials with monoclonal antibodies against MMP-9 for IBD treatment. These include (i) the absence of a causative role of MMP-9 in the pathology in animal models of IBD, (ii) the fact that endotoxins, crossing the intestinal barrier, induce massive local release of both neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) and gelatinase B (MMP-9), (iii) insufficient recognition that MMPs modify the activities of cytokines, chemokines and their receptors, (iv) ignorance that MMPs exist as mixtures of proteoforms with different posttranslational modifications and with different specific activities and (v) the fact that MMPs and TIMPs act in an interactive network, possibly having also beneficial effects on IBD evolution. Nevertheless, inhibition of MMPs may be a useful therapeutic approach during specific IBD disease phases or in specific sub-phenotypes. This temporary "window of opportunity" for MMP-9 inhibition may be complemented by a locoregional one, provided that the pharmacological agents are targeted in time to affected tissues, as is achieved in ophthalmological inflammation. Thus, in order to discover spatial and temporal windows of opportunity for MMP inhibition as treatment of IBD, more preclinical work including well controlled animal studies will be further needed. In this respect, MMP-9/NGAL complex analysis in various body compartments is helpful for better stratification of IBD patients who may benefit from anti-MMP-9.Copyright © 2022 Opdenakker, Vermeire and Abu El-Asrar.

  Title: Treatment with butyrate alleviates dextran sulfate sodium and Clostridium difficile-induced colitis by preventing activity of Th17 cells via regulation of SIRT1/mTOR in mice.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are particularly vulnerable to infection with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI).Available treatments of IBD with CDI have not effective. Butyrate, the metabolites of microbiota, plays a vital role in maintaining immune homeostasis and potential drugs for treatment of IBD with CDI. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of butyrate on IBD with CDI. Mice were given dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and were infected with C. difficile (CD). Butyrate was treated during the study period. Butyrate protected from DSS+CD induced colitis by improving weight loss, survival, colon shorten, activity index score, and suppressing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-17, TNF-α, IL-1β as well as regulating Th17/Treg balance through activation of SIRT1/mTOR. Besides, SR1001, an inhitor of the orphan nuclear receptors retinoic acid-related receptor γt, which is a transcription factor specific to the formation of Th17 cells can suppress the Th17 development and alleviate the DSS+CD induced colitis in mice. Notably, the therapeutic effect of butyrate was revered when disease mice treated with butyrate and Ex-527, a SIRT1 inhibitor. Taken together, we demonstrate that butyrate alleviates dextran sulfate sodium and clostridium difficile induced colitis by preventing Th17 through activation of SIRT1/mTOR.Copyright © 2022.

  Title: Treatment with butyrate alleviates dextran sulfate sodium and Clostridium difficile-induced colitis by preventing activity of Th17 cells via regulation of SIRT1/mTOR in mice.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are particularly vulnerable to infection with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI).Available treatments of IBD with CDI have not effective. Butyrate, the metabolites of microbiota, plays a vital role in maintaining immune homeostasis and potential drugs for treatment of IBD with CDI. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of butyrate on IBD with CDI. Mice were given dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and were infected with C. difficile (CD). Butyrate was treated during the study period. Butyrate protected from DSS+CD induced colitis by improving weight loss, survival, colon shorten, activity index score, and suppressing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-17, TNF-α, IL-1β as well as regulating Th17/Treg balance through activation of SIRT1/mTOR. Besides, SR1001, an inhitor of the orphan nuclear receptors retinoic acid-related receptor γt, which is a transcription factor specific to the formation of Th17 cells can suppress the Th17 development and alleviate the DSS+CD induced colitis in mice. Notably, the therapeutic effect of butyrate was revered when disease mice treated with butyrate and Ex-527, a SIRT1 inhibitor. Taken together, we demonstrate that butyrate alleviates dextran sulfate sodium and clostridium difficile induced colitis by preventing Th17 through activation of SIRT1/mTOR.Copyright © 2022.

  Title: Longitudinal multi-omics analysis identifies early blood-based predictors of anti-TNF therapy response in inflammatory bowel disease.
  Abstract: Treatment with tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) antagonists in IBD patients suffers from primary non-response rates of up to 40%. Biomarkers for early prediction of therapy success are missing. We investigated the dynamics of gene expression and DNA methylation in blood samples of IBD patients treated with the TNF antagonist infliximab and analyzed the predictive potential regarding therapy outcome.We performed a longitudinal, blood-based multi-omics study in two prospective IBD patient cohorts receiving first-time infliximab therapy (discovery: 14 patients, replication: 23 patients). Samples were collected at up to 7 time points (from baseline to 14 weeks after therapy induction). RNA-sequencing and genome-wide DNA methylation data were analyzed and correlated with clinical remission at week 14 as a primary endpoint.We found no consistent ex ante predictive signature across the two cohorts. Longitudinally upregulated transcripts in the non-remitter group comprised TH2- and eosinophil-related genes including ALOX15, FCER1A, and OLIG2. Network construction identified transcript modules that were coherently expressed at baseline and in non-remitting patients but were disrupted at early time points in remitting patients. These modules reflected processes such as interferon signaling, erythropoiesis, and platelet aggregation. DNA methylation analysis identified remission-specific temporal changes, which partially overlapped with transcriptomic signals. Machine learning approaches identified features from differentially expressed genes cis-linked to DNA methylation changes at week 2 as a robust predictor of therapy outcome at week 14, which was validated in a publicly available dataset of 20 infliximab-treated CD patients.Integrative multi-omics analysis reveals early shifts of gene expression and DNA methylation as predictors for efficient response to anti-TNF treatment. Lack of such signatures might be used to identify patients with IBD unlikely to benefit from TNF antagonists at an early time point.© 2022. The Author(s).

  Title: Qing-Chang-Hua-Shi granule ameliorates DSS-induced colitis by activating NLRP6 signaling and regulating Th17/Treg balance.
  Abstract: Chinese herbal medicine Qing-Chang-Hua-Shi granule (QCHS) is widely used to treat ulcerative colitis in China. However, the molecular mechanisms of QCHS remains largely unknown.To assess the therapeutic effects of QCHS on colitis and to reveal its mechanisms of action.The main components of QCHS were identified using a UHPLC-QTOF-MS method and the efficacy of QCHS was evaluated using an DSS-induced mice model. The inflammatory responses and mucosal integrity in colon were comprehensively assessed. Flow cytometry was used to analysis the proportion of Th17 and Treg cells. Detect the signal transduction of the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 6 (NLRP6) both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, siNLRP6 transfection was used to validate the functional targets of QCHS.QCHS treatment significantly alleviated colitis in mice by improving symptoms and pathological damage. Moreover, QCHS treatment suppressed the inflammatory response and preserved the integrity of colon tissue. Most importantly, QCHS balanced the Th17/Treg response of UC mice. Mechanistically, by activating NLRP6 inflammasome pathway, QCHS regulated the maturation of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 to affect inflammation and drive Th17 cell differentiation.The effect of QCHS on UC mice is dose-dependent, with high-dose QCHS being superior to 5-Aminosalicylic acid (200 mg/kg/day). QCHS acts through the NLRP6 signaling pathway to modulate Th17/Treg balance, resulting in the protective effects against colitis. This study investigated the relevant pharmacological mechanisms of QCHS, providing further evidence for the application of QCHS in UC treatment.Copyright © 2022. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

  Title: A BET Protein Inhibitor Targeting Mononuclear Myeloid Cells Affects Specific Inflammatory Mediators and Pathways in Crohn's Disease.
  Abstract: Myeloid cells are critical determinants of the sustained inflammation in Crohn's Disease (CD). Targeting such cells may be an effective therapeutic approach for refractory CD patients. Bromodomain and extra-terminal domain protein inhibitors (iBET) are potent anti-inflammatory agents; however, they also possess wide-ranging toxicities. In the current study, we make use of a BET inhibitor containing an esterase sensitive motif (ESM-iBET), which is cleaved by carboxylesterase-1 (CES1), a highly expressed esterase in mononuclear myeloid cells.We profiled CES1 protein expression in the intestinal biopsies, peripheral blood, and CD fistula tract (fCD) cells of CD patients using mass cytometry. The anti-inflammatory effect of ESM-iBET or its control (iBET) were evaluated in healthy donor CD14+ monocytes and fCD cells, using cytometric beads assay or RNA-sequencing.CES1 was specifically expressed in monocyte, macrophage, and dendritic cell populations in the intestinal tissue, peripheral blood, and fCD cells of CD patients. ESM-iBET inhibited IL1β, IL6, and TNFα secretion from healthy donor CD14+ monocytes and fCD immune cells, with 10- to 26-fold more potency over iBET in isolated CD14+ monocytes. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that ESM-iBET inhibited multiple inflammatory pathways, including TNF, JAK-STAT, NF-kB, NOD2, and AKT signaling, with superior potency over iBET.We demonstrate specific CES1 expression in mononuclear myeloid cell subsets in peripheral blood and inflamed tissues of CD patients. We report that low dose ESM-iBET accumulates in CES1-expressing cells and exerts robust anti-inflammatory effects, which could be beneficial in refractory CD patients.

  Title: Investigation of the effects of anti-TNF agents on hemoglobin levels in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by many clinical features. Anemia is 1 of the most frequent complications and/or extraintestinal manifestations of IBD. There are conflicting data regarding the relationship between changes in hemoglobin levels and disease prevalence in IBD patients with and without antitumor necrosis factor (antiTNF) therapy. In our study, we aimed to investigate the long-term effect of antiTNF agents on anemia in IBD. The records of IBD patients followed-up in our hospital between January 2011 and January 2021 were reviewed retrospectively. Demographic, clinical, endoscopic, radiological and medical treatment data of the patients were recorded. Complete blood count and laboratory markers of inflammation and disease activation, were recorded at the beginning and at the first year of treatment in all patients. The data of patients with and without antiTNF therapy were analyzed statistically. A total of 240 IBD patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study. The number of patients with and without antiTNF therapy was 102 (42.5%) and 138 (57.5%), respectively. The change in all laboratory parameters between the beginning and the first year of treatment was statistically significant (P < .001) in all IBD patients with and without antiTNF therapy. The change in Hb level after 1 year of treatment was significantly different in patients with antiTNF therapy compared to those without therapy (3.00 ± 1.78 g/dL vs 1.19 ± 1.38 g/dL, P < .001). In the multiple regression analysis, male gender, antiTNF therapy, baseline Hb level and iron therapy were independent significant variables of hematopoietic response. This study showed that with appropriate treatment, hemoglobin levels of IBD patients with and without antiTNF therapy increased within 1 year, and the use of antiTNF agents in the treatment of IBD was an independent variable in correcting anemia.Copyright © 2022 the Author(s).

  Title: COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibody and T-cell responses in immunosuppressed patients with inflammatory bowel disease after the third vaccine dose (VIP): a multicentre, prospective, case-control study.
  Abstract: COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibody responses are reduced in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) taking anti-TNF or tofacitinib after two vaccine doses. We sought to assess whether immunosuppressive treatments were associated with reduced antibody and T-cell responses in patients with IBD after a third vaccine dose.VIP was a multicentre, prospective, case-control study done in nine centres in the UK. We recruited immunosuppressed patients with IBD and non-immunosuppressed healthy individuals. All participants were aged 18 years or older. The healthy control group had no diagnosis of IBD and no current treatment with systemic immunosuppressive therapy for any other indication. The immunosuppressed patients with IBD had an established diagnosis of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or unclassified IBD using standard definitions of IBD, and were receiving established treatment with one of six immunosuppressive regimens for at least 12 weeks at the time of first dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. All participants had to have received three doses of an approved COVID-19 vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody binding and T-cell responses were measured in all participant groups. The primary outcome was anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S1 receptor binding domain [RBD]) antibody concentration 28-49 days after the third vaccine dose, adjusted by age, homologous versus heterologous vaccine schedule, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary outcome was assessed in all participants with available data.Between Oct 18, 2021, and March 29, 2022, 352 participants were included in the study (thiopurine n=65, infliximab n=46, thiopurine plus infliximab combination therapy n=49, ustekinumab n=44, vedolizumab n=50, tofacitinib n=26, and healthy controls n=72). Geometric mean anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD antibody concentrations increased in all groups following a third vaccine dose, but were significantly lower in patients treated with infliximab (2736·8 U/mL [geometric SD 4·3]; p<0·0001), infliximab plus thiopurine (1818·3 U/mL [6·7]; p<0·0001), and tofacitinib (8071·5 U/mL [3·1]; p=0·0018) compared with the healthy control group (16 774·2 U/mL [2·6]).

  Title: COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibody and T-cell responses in immunosuppressed patients with inflammatory bowel disease after the third vaccine dose (VIP): a multicentre, prospective, case-control study.
  Abstract: COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibody responses are reduced in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) taking anti-TNF or tofacitinib after two vaccine doses. We sought to assess whether immunosuppressive treatments were associated with reduced antibody and T-cell responses in patients with IBD after a third vaccine dose.VIP was a multicentre, prospective, case-control study done in nine centres in the UK. We recruited immunosuppressed patients with IBD and non-immunosuppressed healthy individuals. All participants were aged 18 years or older. The healthy control group had no diagnosis of IBD and no current treatment with systemic immunosuppressive therapy for any other indication. The immunosuppressed patients with IBD had an established diagnosis of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or unclassified IBD using standard definitions of IBD, and were receiving established treatment with one of six immunosuppressive regimens for at least 12 weeks at the time of first dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. All participants had to have received three doses of an approved COVID-19 vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody binding and T-cell responses were measured in all participant groups. The primary outcome was anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S1 receptor binding domain [RBD]) antibody concentration 28-49 days after the third vaccine dose, adjusted by age, homologous versus heterologous vaccine schedule, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary outcome was assessed in all participants with available data.Between Oct 18, 2021, and March 29, 2022, 352 participants were included in the study (thiopurine n=65, infliximab n=46, thiopurine plus infliximab combination therapy n=49, ustekinumab n=44, vedolizumab n=50, tofacitinib n=26, and healthy controls n=72). Geometric mean anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD antibody concentrations increased in all groups following a third vaccine dose, but were significantly lower in patients treated with infliximab (2736·8 U/mL [geometric SD 4·3]; p<0·0001), infliximab plus thiopurine (1818·3 U/mL [6·7]; p<0·0001), and tofacitinib (8071·5 U/mL [3·1]; p=0·0018) compared with the healthy control group (16 774·2 U/mL [2·6]). There were no significant differences in anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD antibody concentrations between the healthy control group and patients treated with thiopurine (12 019·7 U/mL [2·2]; p=0·099), ustekinumab (11 089·3 U/mL [2·8]; p=0·060), or vedolizumab (13 564·9 U/mL [2·4]; p=0·27). In multivariable modelling, lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD antibody concentrations were independently associated with infliximab (geometric mean ratio 0·15 [95% CI 0·11-0·21]; p<0·0001), tofacitinib (0·52 [CI 0·31-0·87]; p=0·012), and thiopurine (0·69 [0·51-0·95]; p=0·021), but not with ustekinumab (0·64 [0·39-1·06]; p=0·083), or vedolizu

  Title: Cinnamtannin D1 ameliorates DSS-induced colitis by preventing Th17/Treg imbalance through activation of the AMPK/mTOR pathway.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic idiopathic gastrointestinal disease, including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), which is typically characterized by chronicity and relapse. Cinnamtannin D1 (CTD1), extracted from Cinnamomum tamala, has been found to exert good immunosuppressive activity. However, the role of CTD1 in IBD is unclear.The colitis mice model was established by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) treatment. Protein levels (p-STAT3/STAT3, ROR-γt, p-STAT5/STAT5, FOXP3, p-AMPK/AMPK, and p-mTOR/mTOR) were examined using Western blotting analysis. Changes in histopathology were detected through hematoxylin and eosin staining. The proportion of T helper 17 (Th17) cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells was measured by flow cytometry analysis.CTD1 improved body weight and colon length, and alleviated inflammation and histological damage in DSS-induced colitis mice model. DSS treatment also demonstrated a negative effect on Th17-Treg cells balance whereas CTD1 restored the balance of Th17- Treg cells in DSS-induced colitis mice model. Regulatory factors (such as STAT3, ROR-γt, STAT5, and FOXP3) that closely related to the balance of Th17-Treg cells were regulated by CTD1. In addition, AMPK phosphorylation was increased and mTOR phosphorylation was inhibited by CTD1 in DSS-induced colitis mice model.These findings established that CTD1 improved DSS-induced colitis by suppressing Th17-Treg cells balance by activating the AMPK/mTOR pathway. This study provided a new strategy for developing novel treatments for patients with IBD.

  Title: Targeting Lineage-Specific Transcription Factors and Cytokines of the Th17/Treg Axis by Novel 1,3,4-Oxadiazole Derivatives of Pyrrolo[3,4-d]pyridazinone Attenuates TNBS-Induced Experimental Colitis.
  Abstract: The pharmacotherapy of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is still not fully effective and safe. Attempts to search for new IBD drugs remain an incessant research aim. One of the novel approaches is targeting the developmental pathway molecules and effector cytokines of Th17/Treg axis. This study aimed to elucidate the impact of new pyrrolo[3,4-d]pyridazinone derivatives, compounds 7b, 10b, or 13b, on the course of experimental colitis in rats and to assess whether these new compounds may influence Th17/Treg axis. Rats were pretreated with studied compounds intragastrically before intrarectal administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid used for colitis induction. Body weight loss, disease activity index, colon index, and colon tissue damage were analyzed to evaluate the severity of colitis. The colonic levels of RORγt, STAT3, CCR6, Foxp3, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, TNF-α, IL-23, and PGE2 were assessed. Pretreatment with compounds 7b and 13b alleviated the severity of colitis and concomitantly counteracted the increased levels of RORγt, STAT3, CCR6, IL-6, IL-17, IL-23, TNF-α, and PGE2. The beneficial effect of compounds 7b and 13b may be due to the decrease in the levels of Th17-specific transcription factors and cytokines. The studied compounds might therefore constitute a promising therapeutic strategy in Th17/Treg imbalance-driven inflammatory conditions such as IBD.

  Title: Patients with breath test positive are necessary to be identified from irritable bowel syndrome: a clinical trial based on microbiomics and rifaximin sensitivity.
  Abstract: As a non-invasive and effective diagnostic method for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), wild-use of breath test (BT) has demonstrated a high comorbidity rate in patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) and SIBO. Patients overlapping with SIBO respond better to rifaximin therapy than those with IBS-D only. Gut microbiota plays a critical role in both of these two diseases. We aimed to determine the microbial difference between IBS-D overlapping with/without SIBO, and to study the underlying mechanism of its sensitivity to rifaximin.Patients with IBS-D were categorized as BT-negative (IBSN) and BT-positive (IBSP). Healthy volunteers (BT-negative) were enrolled as healthy control. The patients were clinically evaluated before and after rifaximin treatment (0.4 g bid, 4 weeks). Blood, intestine, and stool samples were collected for cytokine assessment and gut microbial analyses.Clinical complaints and microbial abundance were significantly higher in IBSP than in IBSN. In contrast, severe systemic inflammation and more active bacterial invasion function that were associated with enrichment of opportunistic pathogens were seen in IBSN. The symptoms of IBSP patients were relieved in different degrees after therapy, but the symptoms of IBSN rarely changed. We also found that the presence of IBSN-enriched genera ( Enterobacter and Enterococcus ) are unaffected by rifaximin therapy.IBS-D patients overlapping with SIBO showed noticeably different fecal microbial composition and function compared with IBS-D only. The better response to rifaximin in those comorbid patients might associate with their different gut microbiota, which suggests that BT is necessary before IBS-D diagnosis and use of rifaximin.Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR1800017911.Copyright © 2022 The Chinese Medical Association, produced by Wolters Kluwer, Inc. under the CC-BY-NC-ND license.

  Title: Preventive effect of pectic oligosaccharides on acute colitis model mice: modulating epithelial barrier, gut microbiota and Treg/Th17 balance.
  Abstract: Pectin as a dietary fiber supplement has shown emerging potential in clinical ulcerative colitis (UC) adjuvant therapy. In this study, the preventive and prebiotic effects of enzymatically degraded pectic oligosaccharides (POS) were further explored in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis mice. The POS supplement (400 mg kg-1) was significantly effective at improving preventive efficacy, promoting colonic epithelial barrier integrity and reducing inflammatory cytokines. Meanwhile, the changes in T regulatory (Treg) cells and T helper 17 (Th17) cells indicated that POS treatment regulated the Treg/Th17 balance. Gut microbiota analysis showed that the POS supplement reshaped the dysfunctional gut microbiota. Further Spearman's correlation coefficient analysis indicated that the changes of the gut microbiota were highly associated with modulating the epithelial barrier, promoting the development of Treg cells and suppressing the differentiation of pro-inflammatory Th17 cells. All of these results suggest that enzymatically- degraded POS is a promising therapeutic agent for UC prevention and adjuvant treatment by maintaining intestinal homeostasis.

  Title: [Metabolism and therapeutic monitoring of azathioprine in gastroenterology and hepatology].
  Abstract: Azathioprine keeps an important place in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmune hepatitis. This molecule has a narrow therapeutic margin, associated with a risk of toxicity, particularly hematological and hepatic. Its complex metabolism is subject to genetic polymorphisms that are reflected in the inter-individual variability observed in the response to treatment and its tolerance profile. Hence, its use requires a good knowledge of this molecule. Treatment is initiated after a preliminary workup, followed by a progressive titration of the dosage while closely monitoring possible toxicities. Monitoring of blood levels of metabolites (including active ones) helps guide personalized dose adjustment.

  Title: Enterobacter ludwigii protects DSS-induced colitis through choline-mediated immune tolerance.
  Abstract: Commensal intestinal bacteria play key roles in regulating host immune tolerance; however, bacterial strains and related metabolites directly involved in this regulation are largely unknown. Here, using a mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis combined with different antibiotic treatment, Enterobacter ludwigii, abundant in microbiota of mice treated with metronidazole, is screened out to have prophylactic and therapeutic effects on DSS-induced colitis with or without the presence of complex intestinal bacteria. E. ludwigii is found to induce CD103+DC and regulatory T (Treg)-mediated immune tolerance for colitis remission using in vitro and in vivo experiments. Moreover, choline, one metabolite of E. ludwigii, is identified to increase dendritic cells' (DCs) immune tolerance to promote Treg differentiation. E. ludwigii is found to induce DCs' immune tolerance ability for Treg differentiation through choline and α7nAChR-mediated retinoic acid (RA) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) upregulation, resulting in protecting mice against DSS-induced colitis.

  Title: Enterobacter ludwigii protects DSS-induced colitis through choline-mediated immune tolerance.
  Abstract: Commensal intestinal bacteria play key roles in regulating host immune tolerance; however, bacterial strains and related metabolites directly involved in this regulation are largely unknown. Here, using a mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis combined with different antibiotic treatment, Enterobacter ludwigii, abundant in microbiota of mice treated with metronidazole, is screened out to have prophylactic and therapeutic effects on DSS-induced colitis with or without the presence of complex intestinal bacteria. E. ludwigii is found to induce CD103+DC and regulatory T (Treg)-mediated immune tolerance for colitis remission using in vitro and in vivo experiments. Moreover, choline, one metabolite of E. ludwigii, is identified to increase dendritic cells' (DCs) immune tolerance to promote Treg differentiation. E. ludwigii is found to induce DCs' immune tolerance ability for Treg differentiation through choline and α7nAChR-mediated retinoic acid (RA) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) upregulation, resulting in protecting mice against DSS-induced colitis.

  Title: MALT1 reflects inflammatory cytokines, disease activity, and its chronological change could estimate treatment response to infliximab in Crohn's disease patients.
  Abstract: Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1) mediates the immunity and inflammatory response in multiple ways to be intimately involved in the progression of autoimmune diseases. This study intended to explore the linkage of MALT1 with inflammation, disease activity, and its change with infliximab treatment response in Crohn's disease (CD) patients.MALT1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from 72 active CD patients (at baseline, 2 weeks [W2], W6, and W12 after infliximab treatment), 20 remissive CD patients (after enrollment), and 20 healthy controls (after enrollment) were detected by RT-qPCR.MALT1 was highest in active CD patients, followed by remissive CD patients, and lowest in healthy controls (p < 0.001). MALT1 was positively linked with C-reactive protein (p = 0.001), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p = 0.014), clinical disease activity index (p = 0.003), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (p = 0.006), interleukin (IL)-1β (p = 0.049), and IL-17A (p = 0.004), but not other clinical characteristics (all p > 0.05) in active CD patients. After infliximab treatment, MALT1 was decreased from baseline to W12 in active CD patients (p < 0.001), especially in responders (p < 0.001), but not in nonresponders (p = 0.053). The reduction of MALT1 at W6 (p = 0.049) and W12 (p = 0.004) was associated with a good treatment response to infliximab in active CD patients. Moreover, the response rate or MALT1 at any time point was not different between active CD patients with and without TNFi history (all p > 0.05).MALT1 reflects aggravated inflammation and disease activity. Meanwhile, the decrement of MALT1 from baseline to W12 could reflect infliximab treatment response in CD patients.© 2022 The Authors.

  Title: Interleukin-18 cytokine in immunity, inflammation, and autoimmunity: Biological role in induction, regulation, and treatment.
  Abstract: Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in host defense against infections and regulates the innate and acquired immune response. IL-18 is produced by both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells, including monocytes, macrophages, keratinocytes and mesenchymal cell. IL-18 could potentially induce inflammatory and cytotoxic immune cell activities leading to autoimmunity. Its elevated levels have been reported in the blood of patients with some immune-related diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, type I diabetes mellitus, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease. In the present review, we aimed to summarize the biological properties of IL-18 and its pathological role in different autoimmune diseases. We also reported some monoclonal antibodies and drugs targeting IL-18. Most of these monoclonal antibodies and drugs have only produced partial effectiveness or complete ineffectiveness in vitro, in vivo and human studies. The ineffectiveness of these drugs targeting IL-18 may be largely due to the loophole caused by the involvement of other cytokines and proteins in the signaling pathway of many inflammatory diseases besides the involvement of IL-18. Combination drug therapies, that focus on IL-18 inhibition, in addition to other cytokines, are highly recommended to be considered as an important area of research that needs to be explored.Copyright © 2022 Ihim, Abubakar, Zian, Sasaki, Saffarioun, Maleknia and Azizi.

  Title: Multicenter Cohort Study of Infliximab Pharmacokinetics and Therapy Response in Pediatric Acute Severe Ulcerative Colitis.
  Abstract: We aimed to model infliximab (IFX) pharmacokinetics (PK) in pediatric acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) and assess the association between PK parameters, including drug exposure, and clinical response.We studied a multicenter prospective cohort of hospitalized children initiating IFX for ASUC or IBD-unclassified. Serial IFX serum concentrations over 26 weeks were used to develop a PK model. We tested the association of PK parameter estimates with day 7 clinical response, week 8 clinical remission, week 26 corticosteroid-free clinical remission (CSF-CR) (using the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index), and colectomy-free survival.Thirty-eight participants received IFX (median initial dose, 9.9 mg/kg). Day 7 clinical response, week 8 clinical remission, and week 26 CSF-CR occurred in 71%, 55%, and 43%, respectively. Albumin, C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, platelets, weight, and antibodies to IFX were significant covariates incorporated into a PK model. Week 26 non-remitters exhibited faster IFX clearance than remitters (P = .013). However, cumulative IFX exposure did not differ between clinical response groups. One (2.7%) and 4 (10.8%) participants underwent colectomy by week 26 and 2 years, respectively. Day 3 IFX clearance >0.02 L/h was associated with colectomy (hazard ratio, 58.2; 95% confidence interval, 6.0-568.6; P < .001).At median higher-than-label IFX dosing for pediatric ASUC, baseline faster IFX CL was associated with colectomy and at week 26 with lack of CSF-CR. IFX exposure was not predictive of clinical outcomes. Higher IFX dosing may sufficiently optimize early outcomes in pediatric ASUC. Larger studies are warranted to determine whether sustained intensification can overcome rapid clearance and improve later outcomes.gov identifier: NCT02799615.Copyright © 2023 AGA Institute.

  Title: Predictors of Placebo Induction Response and Remission in Ulcerative Colitis.
  Abstract: High placebo response rates in clinical trials of ulcerative colitis (UC) have been reported previously. However, data from patient-level analyses are lacking. We assessed factors associated with clinical and endoscopic placebo response among placebo-treated patients in clinical trials of UC.We performed a post hoc analysis of pooled clinical trial data from GEMINI-1, ACT-1, ACT-2, PURSUIT, ULTRA-2, OCTAVE-1, and OCTAVE-2. Predictors were assessed in placebo-treated patients for their association with end of induction (week 6 of 8) clinical response (reduction in total Mayo score of ≥3 and ≥30% from baseline with ≥1 point decrease in rectal bleeding subscore [RBS] or absolute RBS ≤1); clinical remission (total Mayo score ≤2 and no subscore >1); endoscopic healing (Mayo endoscopic subscore ≤1); partial Mayo score of 0; patient-reported outcome 2-item remission (RBS of 0 and stool frequency ≤1), resolution of rectal bleeding, and stool frequency normalization. Predictors on univariate analyses with P < .05 were included in multivariate logistic regression models.Placebo-treated patients with normal serum C-reactive protein and albumin levels were more likely to attain clinical response (71 of 437 [16.3%] vs 49 of 660 [7.4%]; adjusted odds ratio, 2.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-5.41; P = .018). Compared with patients with a Mayo endoscopic score of 2, patients with a Mayo endoscopic score of 3 were less likely to attain clinical response (105 of 556 [18.8%] vs 179 of 675 [25.9%]; adjusted odds ratio, 0.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.16-0.68; P = .003). Similar findings were observed for clinical remission and resolution of rectal bleeding.Biomarkers such as normal serum C-reactive protein and albumin and baseline endoscopic severity were found to affect placebo response rates in clinical trials of UC. These findings have implications for clinical trial design in UC.Copyright © 2023 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

  Title: The therapeutic effects of cycloastragenol in ulcerative colitis by modulating SphK/MIP-1α/miR-143 signalling.
  Abstract: Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) experience diarrhoea, hematochezia and abdominal pain. UC is a well-known health challenge affecting 200-250 per 100 000 individuals worldwide, with a similar prevalence in both sexes and elevated upon activation of gut immune responses. We evaluated the potential therapeutic effects of cycloastragenol in experimentally induced UC rats and examined the modulation of sphingosine kinase (SphK), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α and miR-143. We treated UC rats with 30 mg/kg cycloastragenol and assessed gene and protein expression levels of SphK, MIP-1α, B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), BCL2-associated X (BAX), miR-143, NF-κB, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and active caspase-3. Colon sections were examined using electron microscopy; additional sections were stained with haematoxylin-eosin or immunostained with anti-TNF-α and anti-caspase-3 antibodies. Electron microscopy of UC specimens revealed dark distorted goblet cell nuclei with disarranged mucus granules and a nondistinct brush border with atypical microvilli. Haematoxylin-eosin staining showed damaged intestinal glands, severe haemorrhage and inflammatory cell infiltration. Cycloastragenol treatment improved the induced morphological changes. In UC rats, cycloastragenol significantly reduced expression levels of SphK, MIP-1α, BAX, NF-κB, TNF-α and active caspase-3, associated with BCL2 and miR-143 overexpression. Therefore, cycloastragenol protects against UC by modulating SphK/MIP-1α/miR-143, subsequently deactivating inflammatory and apoptotic pathways.© 2022 Nordic Association for the Publication of BCPT (former Nordic Pharmacological Society).

  Abstract: Despite being in sustained and stable remission, patients with Crohn's disease (CD) stopping anti-tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) show a high rate of relapse (~50% within 2 years). Characterising non-invasively the biological profiles of those patients is needed to better guide the decision of anti-TNFα withdrawal.Ninety-two immune-related proteins were measured by proximity extension assay in serum of patients with CD (n=102) in sustained steroid-free remission and stopping anti-TNFα (infliximab). As previously shown, a stratification based on time to clinical relapse was used to characterise the distinct biological profiles of relapsers (short-term relapsers: <6 months vs mid/long-term relapsers: >6 months). Associations between protein levels and time to clinical relapse were determined by univariable Cox model.The risk (HR) of mid/long-term clinical relapse was specifically associated with a high serum level of proteins mainly expressed in lymphocytes (LAG3, SH2B3, SIT1; HR: 2.2-4.5; p<0.05), a low serum level of anti-inflammatory effectors (IL-10, HSD11B1; HR: 0.2-0.3; p<0.05) and cellular junction proteins (CDSN, CNTNAP2, CXADR, ITGA11; HR: 0.4; p<0.05). The risk of short-term clinical relapse was specifically associated with a high serum level of pro-inflammatory effectors (IL-6, IL12RB1; HR: 3.5-3.6; p<0.05) and a low or high serum level of proteins mainly expressed in antigen presenting cells (CLEC4A, CLEC4C, CLEC7A, LAMP3; HR: 0.4-4.1; p<0.05).We identified distinct blood protein profiles associated with the risk of short-term and mid/long-term clinical relapse in patients with CD stopping infliximab. These findings constitute an advance for the development of non-invasive biomarkers guiding the decision of anti-TNFα withdrawal.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. No commercial re-use.

  Title: Alopecia and colon ulcers following azathioprine use in a patient with myasthenia gravis: A case report.
  Abstract: Azathioprine is a purine analog (PA) used to treat myasthenia gravis (MG). However, some patients are sensitive to azathioprine and develop severe side effects, such as leukopenia, alopecia, and diarrhea soon after using the medication. Pharmacogenetics plays a crucial role in such intolerance.A 16-year-old woman with MG developed hair loss, pancytopenia, bloody diarrhea, and fever shortly after azathioprine treatment.Pharmacogenetic analysis revealed compound heterozygosity of the nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15) gene, which led to suppressed NUDT15 function. Colonoscopy revealed large ulcers with polypoid lesions in the terminal ileum, cecum, ascending colon, and rectum. These are the characteristics of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Sanger sequencing of NUDT15 gene and colonoscopy for bloody stool evaluation.The patient recovered completely from this acute episode after discontinuation of azathioprine treatment. Her hemogram turned back to normal range. There was also no blood in stool during follow-up.Pharmacogenetic effects should be considered when prescribing PA medication. The possibility of secondary or concomitant autoimmune diseases must always be considered in patients with MG.Copyright © 2022 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

  Title: Exosomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells regulate lymphangiogenesis via the miR-302d-3p/VEGFR3/AKT axis to ameliorate inflammatory bowel disease.
  Abstract: Exosomes released from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (hucMSC-Ex) have been revealed to hold great potential for the development of new treatment approaches for various diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Lymphatic vessels are vital for IBD development and progression to colorectal cancer (CRC), as an occluded conduit for lymphatic fluid to return to the blood.The mechanism involved remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the therapeutic effect of hucMSC-Ex in a mouse model of IBD during the modulation of lymphangiogenesis.We established a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced IBD model in BALB/c mice and observed the influence of hucMSC-Ex on tissue repair, intestinal lymphatic function, changes in lymphangiogenesis, and infiltration of macrophages. We also evaluated the functional changes of human lymphatic endothelial cells (hLECs) in vitro to determine the mechanism by which hucMSC-Ex regulate lymphangiogenesis. Finally, we identified key molecules in hucMSC-Ex by sequencing, database comparison, and cell validation.Results showed that hucMSC-Ex alleviates IBD in mice by improving intestinal lymphatic drainage, inhibiting lymphangiogenesis, and infiltration of macrophages. Mechanistically, the miRNA sequencing results showed that miR-302d-3p was highly expressed in hucMSC-Ex and played an important role in inhibiting lymphangiogenesis by targeting Fms-related receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT4). At the same time, the phosphorylation of AKT was inhibited and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3) was reduced.Collectively, our study suggests that hucMSC-Ex can regulate lymphangiogenesis via the miR-302d-3p/VEGFR3/AKT axis to ameliorate IBD. Our findings identify VEGFR3 as a potential therapeutic target in IBD, where tightly regulated lymphangiogenesis is crucial in its pathogenesis and progression.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

  Title: [Perimyocarditis as a complication of a multiple drug therapy in the treatment of a severe ulcerative colitis episode].
  Abstract: A 19-year-old patient presented as an inpatient with an acute flare-up of ulcerative colitis for about six weeks and symptom progression for one and a half weeks. The patient was treated with topical and oral 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) preparations and oral prednisolone. With an intensification of the prednisolone dose, administration of a monoclonal antibody (Vedolizumab) and antibiotic therapy, inpatient discharge against medical advice. Oral administration of ciprofloxacin due to continued elevated infection parameters. The 5-ASA administration was continued. In the following two weeks, recurrent episodes of fever and renewed inpatient admission.Microbiological detection of Acinetobacter ursingii in blood cultures. Echocardiographic evidence of pericardial effusion. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed no evidence of infective endocarditis. Serological evidence of elevated cardiac enzyme levels. An MRI scan of the heart confirmed the diagnosis of perimyocarditis.Intensive medical care and resistogram-based antibiotic therapy with meropenem, stopping the topical and oral 5-ASA doses and not continuing the integrin antagonist therapy. In addition, start of guideline-based cardiac insufficiency therapy and change of therapy to a tumor necrosis factor alpha blocker. Under the accelerated application scheme, stabilization and improvement of the general condition protracted. After two months of hospitalization, the patient was discharged to outpatient care.Perimyocarditis may occur after long-term administration of 5-ASA. The integrin antagonist as a new therapy can also be a causal factor. Therapeutic management when the cause of the complaint is unclear depends on the symptoms and the most likely cause of the disease. If there is no response to therapy, carry out early re-evaluations.Thieme. All rights reserved.

  Title: Crohn's disease recurrence updates: first surgery vs. surgical relapse patients display different profiles of ileal microbiota and systemic microbial-associated inflammatory factors.
  Abstract: Crohn's disease (CD) pathogenesis is still unclear. Remodeling in mucosal microbiota and systemic immunoregulation may represent an important component in tissue injury. Here, we aim to characterize the ileal microbiota in both pathological and healthy settings and to evaluate the correlated systemic microbial-associated inflammatory markers comparing first-time surgery and relapse clinical conditions.We enrolled 28 CD patients at surgery; we collected inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa tissues and blood samples from each patient. Bacterial wall adherence was observed histologically, while its composition was assessed through amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. In addition, we evaluated the systemic microRNA (miRNA) using quantitative real-time PCR amplification and free fatty acids (FFAs) using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy.The total number of mucosal adherent microbiota was enriched in healthy compared to inflamed mucosa. In contrast, the phylum Tenericutes, the family Ruminococcaceae, and the genera Mesoplasma and Mycoplasma were significantly enriched in the pathological setting. Significant microbiota differences were observed between the relapse and first surgery patients regarding the families Bacillaceae 2 and Brucellaceae and the genera Escherichia/Shigella, Finegoldia, Antrobacter, Gemmatimonas, Moraxella, Anoxibacillus, and Proteus. At the systemic level, we observed a significant downregulation of circulating miR-155 and miR-223, as well as 2-methyl butyric, isobutyric, and hexanoic (caproic) acids in recurrence compared to the first surgery patients. In addition, the level of hexanoic acid seems to act as a predictor of recurrence risk in CD patients (OR 18; 95% confidence interval 1.24-261.81; p = 0.006).We describe a dissimilarity of ileal microbiota composition comparing CD and healthy settings, as well as systemic microbial-associated inflammatory factors between first surgery and surgical relapse. We suggest that patterns of microbiota, associated with healthy ileal tissue, could be involved in triggering CD recurrence. Our findings may provide insight into the dynamics of the gut microbiota-immunity axis in CD surgical recurrence, paving the way for new diagnostics and therapeutics aimed not only at reducing inflammation but also at maintaining a general state of eubiosis in healthy tissue.Copyright © 2022 Russo, Cinci, Di Gloria, Baldi, D’Ambrosio, Nannini, Bigagli, Curini, Pallecchi, Andrea Arcese, Scaringi, Malentacchi, Bartolucci, Ramazzotti, Luceri, Amedei and Giudici.

  Title: Ambroxol, a mucolytic agent, boosts HO-1, suppresses NF-κB, and decreases the susceptibility of the inflamed rat colon to apoptosis: A new treatment option for treating ulcerative colitis.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of unknown etiology that increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer and imposes a lifelong healthcare burden on millions of patients worldwide. Current treatment strategies are associated with significant risks and have been shown to be fairly effective. Hence, discovering new therapies that have better efficacy and safety profiles than currently exploited therapeutic strategies is challenging. It has been well delineated that NF-κB/Nrf2 crosstalk is a chief player in the interplay between oxidative stress and inflammation. Ambroxol hydrochloride, a mucolytic agent, has shown antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity in humans and animals and has not yet been examined for the management of UC. Therefore, our approach was to investigate whether ambroxol could be effective to combat UC using the common acetic acid rat model. Interestingly, a high dose of oral ambroxol (200 mg/kg/day) reasonably improved the microscopic and macroscopic features of the injured colon. This was linked to low disease activity and a reduction in the colonic weight/length ratio. In the context of that, ambroxol boosted Nrf2 activity and upregulated HO-1 and catalase to augment the antioxidant defense against oxidative damage. Besides, ambroxol inactivated NF-κB signaling and its consequent target pro-inflammatory mediators, IL-6 and TNF-α. In contrast, IL-10 is upregulated. Consistent with these results, myeloperoxidase activity is suppressed. Moreover, ambroxol decreased the susceptibility of the injured colon to apoptosis. To conclude, our findings highlight the potential application of ambroxol to modify the progression of UC by its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiapoptotic properties.© 2022 The Authors.

  Title: Ambroxol, a mucolytic agent, boosts HO-1, suppresses NF-κB, and decreases the susceptibility of the inflamed rat colon to apoptosis: A new treatment option for treating ulcerative colitis.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of unknown etiology that increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer and imposes a lifelong healthcare burden on millions of patients worldwide. Current treatment strategies are associated with significant risks and have been shown to be fairly effective. Hence, discovering new therapies that have better efficacy and safety profiles than currently exploited therapeutic strategies is challenging. It has been well delineated that NF-κB/Nrf2 crosstalk is a chief player in the interplay between oxidative stress and inflammation. Ambroxol hydrochloride, a mucolytic agent, has shown antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity in humans and animals and has not yet been examined for the management of UC. Therefore, our approach was to investigate whether ambroxol could be effective to combat UC using the common acetic acid rat model. Interestingly, a high dose of oral ambroxol (200 mg/kg/day) reasonably improved the microscopic and macroscopic features of the injured colon. This was linked to low disease activity and a reduction in the colonic weight/length ratio. In the context of that, ambroxol boosted Nrf2 activity and upregulated HO-1 and catalase to augment the antioxidant defense against oxidative damage. Besides, ambroxol inactivated NF-κB signaling and its consequent target pro-inflammatory mediators, IL-6 and TNF-α. In contrast, IL-10 is upregulated. Consistent with these results, myeloperoxidase activity is suppressed. Moreover, ambroxol decreased the susceptibility of the injured colon to apoptosis. To conclude, our findings highlight the potential application of ambroxol to modify the progression of UC by its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiapoptotic properties.© 2022 The Authors.

  Title: Therapeutic effect of the sulforaphane derivative JY4 on ulcerative colitis through the NF-κB-p65 pathway.
  Abstract: The efficacy of the sulforaphane derivative JY4 was evaluated in acute and chronic mouse models of ulcerative colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate. Oral administration of JY4 led to significant improvements in symptoms, with recovery of body weight and colorectal length, together with reduced diarrhoea, bloody stools, ulceration of colonic tissue and infiltration of inflammatory cells. The oral bioavailability of JY4, determined by comparing oral dosing with injection into the tail vein, was 5.67%, which was comply with the idea in the intestinal function. Using a dual-luciferase reporter assay, immunofluorescence studies, western blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining, JY4 was shown to significant interfere with the NF-κB-p65 signaling pathway. By preventing the activation of NF-κB-p65, JY4 inhibited the overexpression of downstream inflammatory factors, thereby exerting an anti-inflammatory effect on the intestinal tract. This study thus provides a promising candidate drug, and a new concept for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

  Title: Clinical spectrum of elderly-onset inflammatory bowel disease in India.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasingly being recognized in elderly patients. Data on clinical spectrum of elderly-onset IBD patients is lacking from India.A cross-sectional retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of patients diagnosed with IBD was conducted at 2 centers in India. The clinical spectrum of elderly-onset IBD including demographic profile (age and sex), clinical presentation, disease characteristics (disease behavior and severity, extent of disease), and treatment were recorded and compared with adult-onset IBD.During the study period, 3,922 (3,172 ulcerative colitis [UC] and 750 Crohn's disease [CD]) patients with IBD were recorded in the database. A total of 186 patients (4.74%; 116 males [62.36%]) had elderly-onset IBD (69.35% UC and 30.64% CD). Diarrhea, blood in stools, nocturnal frequency and pain abdomen were the commonest presentations for UC, whereas pain abdomen, weight loss and diarrhea were the most frequent symptoms in CD. For both elderly onset UC and CD, majority of the patients had moderately severe disease. Left-sided colitis was the commonest disease location in UC. Isolated ileal disease and inflammatory behavior were the most common disease location and behavior, respectively in CD. 5-Aminosalicylates were the commonest prescribed drug for both elderly onset UC and CD. Thiopurines and biologics were used infrequently. Prevalence of colorectal cancer was higher in elderly onset IBD.Elderly onset IBD is not uncommon in India. Both the elderly onset UC and CD were milder, with no significant differences in disease characteristics (disease extent, location and behavior) when compared to adult-onset IBD. Colorectal cancer was more common in elderly onset IBD.

  Title: Astragalus polysaccharide alleviates ulcerative colitis by regulating the balance of Tfh/Treg cells.
  Abstract: The immunomodulatory function of natural active ingredients has long been a focus of scientific research, with recent hotspots reporting targeted modulation of the follicular helper T cells (Tfh)/regulatory T cells (Treg) balance as an emerging strategy for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). Here, dextran sodium sulfate induced mice UC and Astragalus polysaccharide (APS, 200 mg/kg/day) was administered simultaneously. In this study, APS effectively alleviated colitis in mice by improving survival rate, disease activity index (DAI), the change rate of body weight, colonic length and weight, and histopathological injury of the colon. Moreover, APS regulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-23, Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-ɑ, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 in colonic tissues of colitis mice. Importantly, APS significantly downregulated Tfh cell and the expression of its related nuclear transcription factors Blimp-1 and Bcl-6, and cytokine IL-21. Meanwhile, APS regulated the differentiation of Tfh subpopulations in colitis mice, with Tfh10 and Tfr significantly upregulated while Tfh1, Tfh17, and Tfh21 significantly downregulated. In addition, APS significantly upregulated Treg cells and the levels of its associated nuclear transcription factor Foxp3, and cytokine IL-10 in colitis mice. In conclusion, APS effectively alleviated UC by reshaping the balance of Tfh/Treg cells.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

  Title: Subcutaneous administration, higher age and lower renal function are associated with erythrocyte methotrexate accumulation in Crohn's disease: a cross-sectional study.
  Abstract: Methotrexate is an immunomodulatory drug for patients with Crohn's disease. Erythrocyte MTX-polyglutamates (MTX-PG1-5) may be used for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) as MTX-PG is thought to mediate MTX's efficacy. Information on determinants of the concentration of MTX-PG in patients with Crohn's disease is lacking. We aim to identify clinical and biochemical determinants of the erythrocyte MTX-PG1-5 and MTX-PGtotal concentration in patients with Crohn's disease.Adults with Crohn's disease on methotrexate treatment who visited the outpatient clinic of Amsterdam UMC were included. Erythrocyte MTX-PGs were measured by tandem mass spectrometry.Nineteen patients were included, with a median duration of MTX use of 77 months (range 7-202). Twelve patients received MTX monotherapy, whereas 7 patients were on concomitant TNF-α inhibitors. The mean dose of MTX was 15.5 mg (SD ± 2.8) and 12 (63%) patients used subcutaneous MTX. MTX-PG1-5 were successfully measured in 18 patients, showing substantial variability in concentrations of MTX-PGtotal and individual species. The median MTX-PGtotal was 117.1 nmol/L (range 46.4-258.7) with preferential accumulation of MTX-PG3 (43.1 nmol/L, range 15.3-96.1). Patients on subcutaneous compared to oral MTX had higher median MTX-PG(4,5) levels (55 versus 9 nmol/L, p = 0.01). Higher age (β = 0.71) and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (β = - 0.52) were associated with a significantly higher MTX-PGtotal concentration (R2 = 0.60, p = 0.001).MTX-PG concentrations display a considerable inter-individual variability. Higher MTX-PG accumulation is associated with subcutaneous administration, higher age, and lower renal function in Crohn's disease patients.© 2022. The Author(s).

  Title: Protective effect of traditional Korean fermented soybean foods (doenjang) on a dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis mouse model.
  Abstract: Objective: The cause of ulcerative colitis (UC) is unknown, and the use of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs with certain side effects is currently replacing treatment. Therefore, it is important to find new healthy foods or ingredients that exhibit potential protective and anti-inflammatory effects on UC. This study investigated the potential protective effect of doenjang on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in a mouse model. Materials and methods: Four doenjang samples (TCD21-51-1, TCD21-55-1, TMD21-16-1, and TFD21-1-1) were used. To examine the effects of the four doenjang samples on UC caused by DSS in a mouse model, the clinical symptoms of UC, such as body weight, disease activity index (DAI), and colon macroscopic damage index (CMDI) were analyzed. Moreover, immune-related blood cell counts, serum levels and protein expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), and nitric oxide (NO) production were measured in DSS-induced UC in mice for analysis. Results: The four doenjang samples increased the colon length shortened by DSS, reduced DAI (diarrhea and hemoccult), CMDI (ulceration, inflammation, and hemorrhage) and the content of immune-related cells in the blood. Moreover, the levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and NO increased by DSS were decreased by doenjang, and tissue damage was significantly reduced. Conclusions: These findings confirmed that doenjang exerts protective effects against UC, suggesting its possible use in developing therapeutic strategies or functional products.

  Abstract: Food-grade isomaltulose exhibits significant modulation of gut microbiota and its metabolites in healthy populations. This study further explored the preventive therapeutic effect and anti-colitis potential of isomaltulose on dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice. Our results suggested that isomaltulose played a significant role in preventing colon shortening, reducing intestinal epithelial destruction and inhibiting inflammatory cell infiltration. Meanwhile, the isomaltulose supplement greatly reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and restored the balance between T helper type 17 (Th17) cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells. Pathway enrichment analysis for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) also indicated that the anti-inflammatory effect of isomaltulose was closely related to intestinal immunity. Moreover, the disturbed gut microbiota in ulcerative colitis (UC) was partially restored after treatment with isomaltulose. These results suggest that isomaltulose is a promising therapeutic agent for the prevention and adjunctive treatment of UC by maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis and remodeling the gut microbiota.

  Title: Potent CCR3 Receptor Antagonist, SB328437, Suppresses Colonic Eosinophil Chemotaxis and Inflammation in the Winnie Murine Model of Spontaneous Chronic Colitis.
  Abstract: Eosinophils and their regulatory molecules have been associated with chronic intestinal inflammation and gastrointestinal dysfunctions; eosinophil accumulation in the gut is prominent in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The chemokine receptor CCR3 plays a pivotal role in local and systemic recruitment and activation of eosinophils. In this study, we targeted CCR3-ligand interactions with a potent CCR3 receptor antagonist, SB328437, to alleviate eosinophil-associated immunological responses in the Winnie model of spontaneous chronic colitis. Winnie and C57BL/6 mice were treated with SB328437 or vehicle. Clinical and histopathological parameters of chronic colitis were assessed. Flow cytometry was performed to discern changes in colonic, splenic, circulatory, and bone marrow-derived leukocytes. Changes to the serum levels of eosinophil-associated chemokines and cytokines were measured using BioPlex. Inhibition of CCR3 receptors with SB328437 attenuated disease activity and gross morphological damage to the inflamed intestines and reduced eosinophils and their regulatory molecules in the inflamed colon and circulation. SB328437 had no effect on eosinophils and their progenitor cells in the spleen and bone marrow. This study demonstrates that targeting eosinophils via the CCR3 axis has anti-inflammatory effects in the inflamed intestine, and also contributes to understanding the role of eosinophils as potential end-point targets for IBD treatment.

  Title: Curative effects of fucoidan on acetic acid induced ulcerative colitis in rats via modulating aryl hydrocarbon receptor and phosphodiesterase-4.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease. Fucoidan, sulfated polysaccharide of brown seaweed, demonstrates various pharmacological actions as anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor and anti-bacterial effects. Therefore, we opt to investigate the potential curative effects of fucoidan in experimentally induced UC in rats through modulating aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1).UC was induced in rats using intracolonic 2 ml of 4% acetic acid. Some rats were treated with 150 mg/kg fucoidan. Samples of colon were used to investigate gene and protein expression of AhR, PDE4, Nrf2, HO-1 and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Sections of colon were stained with hematoxylin/eosin, Alcian blue or immune-stained with anti-PDE4 antibodies.Investigation of hematoxylin/eosin stained micro-images of UC rats revealed damaged intestinal glands, severe hemorrhage and inflammatory cell infiltration, while sections stained with Alcian Blue revealed damaged and almost absent intestinal glands. UC results in elevated gene and protein expression of PDE4 associated with reduced gene and protein expression of AhR, IL-22, cAMP, Nrf2 and HO-1. Finally, UC increased the oxidative stress and reduced antioxidant activity in colon tissues. All morphological changes as well as gene and protein expressions were ameliorated by fucoidan.Fucoidan could treat UC induced in rats. It restored the normal weight and length of colon associated with morphological improvement as found by examining sections stained with hematoxylin/eosin and Alcian Blue. The curative effects could be explained by enhancing antioxidant activity, reducing the expression of PDE4 and increasing the expression of AhR, IL-22 and cAMP.© 2022. The Author(s).

  Title: Use of Tumor Necrosis Factor-α Antagonists Is Associated With Attenuated IgG Antibody Response Against SARS-CoV-2 in Vaccinated Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Abstract: Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) frequently receive immunomodulating treatment, which may render them at increased risk of an attenuated immune response upon vaccination. In this study, we assessed the effects of different types of commonly prescribed immunosuppressive medications on the serological response after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with IBD.In this prospective observational cohort study, IgG antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 were measured 2-10 weeks after completion of standard vaccination regimens in patients with IBD. Clinical characteristics, previous history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, type of vaccine (mRNA- or vector-based) and medication use were recorded at the time of sampling. Subsequently, a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay was used for the quantitative determination of IgG antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.Three hundred and twelve (312) patients with IBD were included (172 Crohn's disease [CD] and 140 ulcerative colitis [UC]). Seroconversion (defined as titer of >50 AU/ml) was achieved in 98.3% of patients. Antibody concentrations were significantly lower in patients treated with TNF-α-antagonists vs. non-users of TNF-α-antagonists (geometric mean [95% confidence interval]: 2204 [1655-2935] vs. 5002 [4089-6116] AU/ml, P<0.001). In multivariable models, use of TNF-α-antagonists (P<0.001), vector vaccines (P<0.001), age (>50 years) (P<0.01) and CD (P<0.05) were independently associated with lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers. In patients who received mRNA vaccines, users of thiopurines (either prescribed as monotherapy or in combination with biologicals) demonstrated significantly lower antibody titers compared to thiopurine non-users (P<0.05).Despite reassuring findings that most patients with IBD have detectable antibodies after anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, TNF-α-antagonists were found to be strongly associated with an attenuated IgG antibody response after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, independent of vaccine type, the time elapsed after vaccination and blood sampling, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and patient age. Patients treated with thiopurines and receiving mRNA-based vaccines demonstrated lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers compared with non-users.Copyright © 2022 Otten, Bourgonje, Horinga, van der Meulen, Festen, van Dullemen, Weersma, van Leer-Buter, Dijkstra and Visschedijk.

  Title: Efficacy of Sishen Wan on dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced ulcerative colitis and its effect on toll-like receptor 2/interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-4/nuclear factor-κB signal pathway.
  Abstract: To investigate the therapeutic effect of Sishen Wan (, SSW) on ulcerative colitis (UC) induced by dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid and its effect on toll-like receptor 2/interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-4/nuclear factor-κB (TLR2/IRAK4/NF-κB) sig-naling pathway in colonic tissue.In this study, 120 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into blank and model groups. The experimental UC model in rats was established by subcutaneous injection of hydrocortisone + senna gavage for 21 d + dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS)/ ethanol solution enema. The successful model rats were randomly divided into the model group; mesalazine (0.36 g/kg) group; and high-, medium-, and low- dose SSW (24, 12, and 6 g/kg) groups. The model and blank groups were gavaged with equal volumes of distilled water once a day for 21 d. The general condition of the rats was observed, and the body mass, fecal properties, and occult blood were recorded for calculating the disease activity index (DAI) score. The colonic tissue of the rats was collected, and its general morphology and pathological form were noted for obtaining the colonic mucosal injury index (CMDI) score. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to view the pathological changes of the colon tissue in each group, apoptosis of the cells was detected using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling staining, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure the expressions of TLR2, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), IRAK4, and NF-κB p65 mRNA in the colon tissue. The expressions of TLR2, MyD88, IRAK4, and NF-κB p65 protein were detected using western blotting and immunohistochemistry assay, and the levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the colon tissue were determined using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.Compared with the blank group, the general condition of the model group was relatively poor. The DAI and CMDI scores of the model group increased significantly (< 0.01), the glands and intestinal mucosa disappeared partially, and several inflammatory cells infiltrated and gathered in the mucosal layer and base layer of the rats in the model group. Furthermore, the cell apoptosis and expression levels of TLR2, MyD88, IRAK4, and NF-κB p65 mRNA and protein in the colon tissue of rats in the model group increased significantly (< 0.01). The levels of IL-1β and TNF-α increased significantly in the colon tissue of rats in the model group (< 0.01). After treatment with SSW, compared with the model group, the general condition of the UC rats improved. Moreover, the DAI and CMDI scores of the UC rats decreased significantly (< 0.05), and the pathological changes in the colon tissue of the UC rats tended to be

The expressions of TLR2, MyD88, IRAK4, and NF-κB p65 protein were detected using western blotting and immunohistochemistry assay, and the levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the colon tissue were determined using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.Compared with the blank group, the general condition of the model group was relatively poor. The DAI and CMDI scores of the model group increased significantly (< 0.01), the glands and intestinal mucosa disappeared partially, and several inflammatory cells infiltrated and gathered in the mucosal layer and base layer of the rats in the model group. Furthermore, the cell apoptosis and expression levels of TLR2, MyD88, IRAK4, and NF-κB p65 mRNA and protein in the colon tissue of rats in the model group increased significantly (< 0.01). The levels of IL-1β and TNF-α increased significantly in the colon tissue of rats in the model group (< 0.01). After treatment with SSW, compared with the model group, the general condition of the UC rats improved. Moreover, the DAI and CMDI scores of the UC rats decreased significantly (< 0.05), and the pathological changes in the colon tissue of the UC rats tended to be

  Title: Sanhuang Xiexin decoction ameliorates DSS-induced colitis in mice by regulating intestinal inflammation, intestinal barrier, and intestinal flora.
  Abstract: Sanhuang Xiexin decoction (SXD) is a widely applicated traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with a significant intestinal anti-inflammatory effect.To evaluate the therapeutic effect and elucidate the possible underlying mechanisms of SXD on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice.To model UC, 3% DSS was added to the drinking water for 7 days. The UC mice were grouped and treated with three doses of SXD (1.3, 2.6, and 6 g/kg) orally for 7 days. Mice body weight and disease activity index (DAI) scores were recorded daily. After treatment with SXD, the colon was removed, and the colon length and histopathological changes were recorded. Blood cells were counted and colonic inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress indicators were examined. The key proteins in TLR4-MyD88-NF-κB signaling and the colonic barrier were determined by Western blot analysis. The restorative effect of SXD on intestinal flora was determined.Treatment with SXD reduced DAI scores, increased body weight, improved colon shortening, and decreased colonic damage. SXD decreased the numbers of white blood cells (WBCs), increased the numbers of red blood cells (RBCs), and inhibited the expression of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress indicators. In addition, SXD displayed an effective anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the expression levels of p-IκBα, TLR4, MyD88, and p65. Furthermore, SXD significantly restored the integrity of the colonic barrier and the abundance of beneficial flora.SXD significantly reduced DSS-induced colon damage when the dose was higher than 1.3 g/kg, and the middle dose group (2.6 g/kg) indicated the best effect. SXD effectively ameliorated DSS-induced UC in mice, possibly by inhibiting oxidative stress, protecting the mucosal barrier, inhibiting the TLR4-MyD88-NF-κB signaling pathway, and regulating the intestinal flora.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

  Title: Formyl peptide receptor 2 as a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory bowel disease.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a global health burden whose existing treatment is largely dependent on anti-inflammatory agents. Despite showing some therapeutic actions, their clinical efficacy and adverse events are unacceptable. Resolution as an active and orchestrated phase of inflammation involves improper inflammatory response with three key triggers, specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), neutrophils and phagocyte efferocytosis. The formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2/ALX) is a human G protein-coupled receptor capable of binding SPMs and participates in the resolution process. This receptor has been implicated in several inflammatory diseases and its association with mouse model of IBD was established in some resolution-related studies. Here, we give an overview of three reported FPR2/ALX agonists highlighting their respective roles in pro-resolving strategies.© 2022.

  Title: Cell-autonomous Hedgehog signaling controls Th17 polarization and pathogenicity.
  Abstract: Th17 cells are key drivers of autoimmune disease. However, the signaling pathways regulating Th17 polarization are poorly understood. Hedgehog signaling regulates cell fate decisions during embryogenesis and adult tissue patterning. Here we find that cell-autonomous Hedgehog signaling, independent of exogenous ligands, selectively drives the polarization of Th17 cells but not other T helper cell subsets. We show that endogenous Hedgehog ligand, Ihh, signals to activate both canonical and non-canonical Hedgehog pathways through Gli3 and AMPK. We demonstrate that Hedgehog pathway inhibition with either the clinically-approved small molecule inhibitor vismodegib or genetic ablation of Ihh in CD4+ T cells greatly diminishes disease severity in two mouse models of intestinal inflammation. We confirm that Hedgehog pathway expression is upregulated in tissue from human ulcerative colitis patients and correlates with Th17 marker expression. This work implicates Hedgehog signaling in Th17 polarization and intestinal immunopathology and indicates the potential therapeutic use of Hedgehog inhibitors in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.© 2022.

  Title: Two cases of ulcerative colitis that developed while using abatacept.
  Abstract: Abatacept (ABT) is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the Fc domain fragment of human IgG1 and the extracellular domain of human cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4). The function of ABT is similar to that of CTLA-4, which selectively regulates T-cell activation by inhibiting the co-stimulation of CD80/CD86 on antigen-presenting cells and CD28 on T lymphocytes. ABT is used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. We report two cases of ulcerative colitis (UC) that developed while using ABT. Case 1 is of a 58-year-old man who developed diarrhea and hematochezia 2 months after starting ABT therapy for RA. Case 2 is of a 66-year-old man who experienced hematochezia 15 months after starting ABT therapy for RA. In both cases, no obvious gastrointestinal symptoms were observed before ABT therapy was initiated. Colonoscopy after disease onset showed UC findings in both cases. The patients' condition improved following ABT withdrawal and treatment for UC. Several cases of UC development during ABT therapy have been reported. The complication of UC should be considered when diarrhea and hematochezia are observed in patients with RA being treated with CTLA-4Ig agents.© 2022. Japanese Society of Gastroenterology.

  Title: Parvovirus B19-triggered hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in a patient with Crohn's disease.
  Abstract: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a life threatening condition caused by inappropriate immune activity. Infection is often the trigger, both in genetically predisposed and in sporadic cases. Although more commonly seen in the paediatric population, patients of all ages can be affected.A 26-year-old male patient with Crohn's disease, treated with ustekinumab, presented with high fever, epistaxis and anorexia. Laboratory results showed pancytopenia, and a high serum levels of ferritin and LDH. Colonoscopy revealed only mild signs of disease activity. CT-scan showed splenomegaly and multiple lymphadenopathies. Bone marrow aspirate was suggestive for hemophagocytosis. PCR & serology for parvovirus B19 came back positive. Treatment with ustekinumab was temporarily put on hold and supportive care was given. Viral replication decreased and he recovered completely.There is a known association between HLH and Crohn's disease. This is probably because they are more susceptible to infections with CMV, EBV and parvovirus B19, all known as triggers for HLH. The role of ustekinumab is unclear: did it play a role in the pathophysiological evolution of this primo-infection with parvovirus B19? On the other hand, did it contribute to the rather mild course of the disease, acting as a immunomodulator that works on interleukin-12, a cytokine that plays a role in HLH? Further study is warranted to answer these questions.© Acta Gastro-Enterologica Belgica.

  Title: Targeting Angiogenesis via Resolution of Inflammation.
  Abstract: Angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels, plays a critical role in tissue repair and regeneration, as well as in cancer. A paradigm shift is emerging in our understanding of the resolution of inflammation as an active biochemical process with the discovery of novel endogenous specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), including resolvins. Angiogenesis and the resolution of inflammation are critical interdependent processes. Disrupted inflammation resolution can accelerate tumor growth, which is angiogenesis-dependent. SPMs, including resolvins and lipoxins, inhibit physiologic and pathological angiogenesis at nanogram concentrations. The failure of resolution of inflammation is an emerging hallmark of angiogenesis-dependent diseases including arthritis, psoriasis, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, inflammatory bowel disease, atherosclerosis, endometriosis, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. Whereas therapeutic angiogenesis repairs tissue damage (e.g., limb ischemia), inhibition of pathological angiogenesis suppresses tumor growth and other non-neoplastic diseases such as retinopathies. Stimulation of resolution of inflammation via pro-resolving lipid mediators promotes the repair of tissue damage and wound healing, accelerates tissue regeneration, and inhibits cancer. Here we provide an overview of the mechanisms of cross talk between angiogenesis and inflammation resolution in chronic inflammation-driven diseases. Stimulating the resolution of inflammation via pro-resolving lipid mediators has emerged as a promising new field to treat angiogenic diseases.Copyright © 2023 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.

  Title: Etrolizumab-s Does Not Induce Residual Trafficking of Regulatory T Cells.
  Abstract: Blocking immune cell gut homing via α4β7 integrin with the monoclonal antibody vedolizumab is an established therapeutic strategy in inflammatory bowel disease. However, despite promising preclinical and phase 2 clinical data, the anti-β7 antibody etrolizumab yielded disappointing results in a large phase 3 trial program in UC. Mechanistic explanations are still lacking. We have recently shown that vedolizumab is associated with residual homing of regulatory T (Treg) cells in a certain exposure range and aimed to investigate whether a similar mechanism applies for etrolizumab.We used flow cytometry, competitive dynamic adhesion, and transmigration assays to assess binding of the etrolizumab surrogate (etrolizumab-s) antibody FIB504 to Treg and effector T cells (Teff) and to explore the impact on cell trafficking.We observed only minimal differences in the binding of etrolizumab-s to Treg and Teff cells. Dynamic adhesion and transmigration of Treg and Teff cells was not substantially differentially affected at relevant concentrations. The β1+ and PI16+ Treg cells were only resistant to etrolizumab-s at low concentrations.Etrolizumab does not seem to induce notable residual trafficking of Treg cells. Thus, the Teff overweight in the inflamed gut might persist despite reduced overall T cell recruitment. This might be one piece of the puzzle to explain recent clinical results in phase 3.© The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

  Title: Sinapic Acid Ameliorates Acetic Acid-Induced Ulcerative Colitis in Rats by Suppressing Inflammation, Oxidative Stress, and Apoptosis.
  Abstract: Background: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a long-term condition which results in inflammation and ulcers of the colon and rectum. The key indications of active disease are abdominal pain and diarrhea mixed with blood. Aims: We explore the underlying colon protective mechanism of sinapic acid (SA) against acetic acid (AA) induced ulcerative colitis in rats. The implications of inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis are studied. Methodology: Twenty-four rats were distributed into four categories, normal control (NC), ulcerative colitis (UC), ulcerative Colitis with SA 40 mg/kg (SA 40 mg/kg + AA), and ulcerative colitis with prednisolone (PRDL 10 mg/kg + AA), and were pretreated orally with saline, saline and SA (40 mg/kg/day) or PRDL (10 mg/kg/day) respectively, for 7 days. UC was prompted by trans-rectal administration of 4% AA on the 5th day, colon tissues were surgically removed for gross morphology and histological inspection, oxidative stress, and inflammatory markers and immunoblot analysis of Bax, caspase-3, and Bcl-2. Results: Macroscopic and histological inspection demonstrated that both SA 40 mg/kg and PRDL (10 mg/kg/day) significantly ameliorates colonic injuries. In addition, both pretreatments significantly ameliorates AA-induced UC, oxidative stress, as indicated by suppressed malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) levels and restoring antioxidant/oxidant balance as indicated by catalase and glutathione levels, suppressed inflammation via inhibiting cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, inflammatory markers MPO, PGE2, COX-2 and NF-κB and inhibiting the protein expression of Bax and caspase-3 apoptotic protein and increasing the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2 thereby inhibiting apoptosis. Conclusion: Sinapic acid significantly ameliorates AA induced UC in rats by suppressing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in colonic tissues which exhibits its potential for the management of UC.

  Title: Sinapic Acid Ameliorates Acetic Acid-Induced Ulcerative Colitis in Rats by Suppressing Inflammation, Oxidative Stress, and Apoptosis.
  Abstract: Background: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a long-term condition which results in inflammation and ulcers of the colon and rectum. The key indications of active disease are abdominal pain and diarrhea mixed with blood. Aims: We explore the underlying colon protective mechanism of sinapic acid (SA) against acetic acid (AA) induced ulcerative colitis in rats. The implications of inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis are studied. Methodology: Twenty-four rats were distributed into four categories, normal control (NC), ulcerative colitis (UC), ulcerative Colitis with SA 40 mg/kg (SA 40 mg/kg + AA), and ulcerative colitis with prednisolone (PRDL 10 mg/kg + AA), and were pretreated orally with saline, saline and SA (40 mg/kg/day) or PRDL (10 mg/kg/day) respectively, for 7 days. UC was prompted by trans-rectal administration of 4% AA on the 5th day, colon tissues were surgically removed for gross morphology and histological inspection, oxidative stress, and inflammatory markers and immunoblot analysis of Bax, caspase-3, and Bcl-2. Results: Macroscopic and histological inspection demonstrated that both SA 40 mg/kg and PRDL (10 mg/kg/day) significantly ameliorates colonic injuries. In addition, both pretreatments significantly ameliorates AA-induced UC, oxidative stress, as indicated by suppressed malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) levels and restoring antioxidant/oxidant balance as indicated by catalase and glutathione levels, suppressed inflammation via inhibiting cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, inflammatory markers MPO, PGE2, COX-2 and NF-κB and inhibiting the protein expression of Bax and caspase-3 apoptotic protein and increasing the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2 thereby inhibiting apoptosis. Conclusion: Sinapic acid significantly ameliorates AA induced UC in rats by suppressing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in colonic tissues which exhibits its potential for the management of UC.

  Title: Timing of Live Attenuated Vaccination in Infants Exposed to Infliximab or Adalimumab in Utero: A Prospective Cohort Study in 107 Children.
  Abstract: For infants exposed in utero to anti-tumour necrosis factor-α [TNF] medications, it is advised that live-attenuated vaccinations be postponed until the drug is cleared, but little is known about time to clearance. To minimize delays before live-attenuated vaccination can be given, we aimed to develop a pharmacokinetic model to predict time-to-clearance in infants exposed during pregnancy.We prospectively followed in utero infliximab/adalimumab-exposed infants of mothers with inflammatory bowel disease across four countries between 2011 and 2018. Infants with a detectable anti-TNF umbilical-cord level and at least one other blood sample during the first year of life were included.Overall, 107 infants were enrolled, including 166 blood samples from 71 infliximab-exposed infants and 77 samples from 36 adalimumab-exposed infants. Anti-TNF was detectable in 23% [n = 25] of infants at 6 months. At 12 months, adalimumab was not detected but 4% [n = 3] had detectable infliximab. A Bayesian forecasting method was developed using a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model. Model validation showed that the predicted clearing time was in accordance with the measured observations. A clinician-friendly online calculator was developed for calculating full anti-TNF clearing time: https://xiaozhu.shinyapps.io/antiTNFcalculator2/.Almost one-quarter of infants born to mothers receiving anti-TNF during pregnancy have detectable anti-TNF at 6 months. To limit the time to live-attenuated vaccination in infants of mothers receiving anti-TNF during pregnancy, the results of a cord drug level at birth and a second sample ≥ 1 month thereafter can be used to estimate the time for full anti-TNF clearance in these children.© The Author(s) 2022.

  Title: Phycocyanin stimulates ulcerative colitis healing via selective activation of cannabinoid receptor-2, intestinal mucosal healing, Treg accumulation, and p38MAPK/MK2 signaling inhibition.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory condition that until this date, lacks curative treatments. Previously, synthetic selective CB2 receptor (CB2R) agonists demonstrated effective preclinical anti-inflammatory activities in UC. Phycocyanin (PC), photosynthetic assistant protein isolated from Microcystis aeruginosa Kützing blue green algae, has multiple pharmacological effects, however, it's effect against UC remains unexplored. Our study aimed at investigating the therapeutic effectiveness of PC against UC, and correlating its mechanisms with CB2R agonistic activities. In silico; PC showed structural similarity with endocannabinoid receptors' ligand "Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol", target prediction studies suggested high affinity for G-coupled protein family-receptors, and molecular docking affirmed preferable affinity towards CB2R vs CB1R. In LPS-exposed-Caco-2 cell line; PC demonstrated comparable interaction with CB2R, and downregulation of CB2R, p38 and MK2 gene expressions with reference agonist "6d", and exhibited preferred selectivity towards CB2R over CB1R. In DSS-induced mice; PC-treatment ameliorated DSS-induced colon shortening, elevated disease activity index, and colonic pathological alterations. PC showed effective CB2R activation through potent anti-inflammatory activities, Treg-cell accumulation, suppression in p38MAPK/MK2 signaling, and tight junction barrier restoration as indicated by ultrastructural examinations, elevated ZO-1 and occludin protein expressions, and Ki67 immunohistochemical expression in colonic tissues. Additionally, PC alleviated intestinal dysbiosis via downregulating LPS/TLR4/NF-κB signaling and gut microbiota maintenance. Notably, PC-protective activities were abolished when co-administered with SR144528 (selective CB2 antagonist) except for gut microbiota maintenance, which was independent from CB2R activation. Our findings provide evidence of PC effectiveness against UC through acting as CB2R agonist, thus expanding its possible therapeutic application against other inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

  Title: Vitamin D Reduces the Helper T Cells 17 (Th17) Differentiation in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis by Targeting Long Non-coding RNA (lncRNA) OIP5-AS1/miR-26a-5p/IL-6 Axis.
  Abstract: Vitamin D has anti-inflammatory efficacy against ulcerative colitis (UC), however, the mechanism is yet little understood.To investigate the immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D against the UC, and to explore the potential downstream mechanisms.Serum vitamin D, Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and Interleukin (IL)-17 levels of the patients with UC were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) levels were determined by using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from healthy control subjects, stimulated with CD4+ T lymphocytes or helper T cells 17(Th17) differentiation conditions, and then exposed to calcitriol (vitamin D active form) or certain lentiviral treatment, followed by subsequent molecular level testing. For in vivo assay, mice were given 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to induce colitis.Compared with the control group, vitamin D levels in the UCs were statistically lower, and there was a negative correlation between IL-17 and vitamin D in the UCs. The lncRNA OIP5-AS1 could decrease under calcitriol treatment in both CD4+ T cells and Th17 differentiation. The lncRNA OIP5-AS1 was a microRNA (miR)-26a-5p sponge and therefore modulated the Th17 cells and IL-6 expression. The lncRNA OIP5-AS1/miR-26a-5p/IL-6 axis mediated the regulation of calcitriol-induced Th17 differentiation. Calcitriol had therapeutic effects on the UC mouse models by regulating the lncRNA OIP5-AS1 related pathway.Vitamin D might have anti-inflammatory potential in the treatment of the UC.

  Title: Polydatin alleviates DSS- and TNBS-induced colitis by suppressing Th17 cell differentiation via directly inhibiting STAT3.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a non-specific chronic intestinal inflammatory disease, often presenting with abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, anorexia, and body loss. It is difficult to cure completely and a promising treatment is urgently needed. Natural compounds can offer promising chemical agents for treatment of diseases. Polydatin is a natural ingredient extracted from the dried rhizome of Polygonum cuspidatum, which has anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and dementia protection activities. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of polydatin on IBD and explore its possible mechanism. We found that polydatin could effectively suppress the differentiation of Th17 cells in vitro, but had no effect on the differentiation of Treg cells. Polydatin significantly alleviated colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) in mice, and dramatically decreased the proportion of Th17 cells in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes. Mechanism investigations revealed that polydatin specifically inhibited signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation by directly binding to STAT3, leading to Th17 cell reduction and thereby alleviating colitis. These findings provide novel insights into the anti-colitis effect of polydatin, which may be a promising drug candidate for the treatment of IBD.© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

  Title: Astragaloside Ⅳ alleviates ulcerative colitis by regulating the balance of Th17/Treg cells.
  Abstract: Restoring immune homeostasis by targeting the Th17/Treg response is a potentially valuable therapeutic strategy for ulcerative colitis (UC). Astragaloside IV (AS-Ⅳ) is a phytochemical naturally occurring in Astragalus membranaceus that has good anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-stress properties. However, the effects of AS-IV on the homeostasis of Th17/Treg cells in colitis mice remains unknown.To investigate the protective effects and potential immunomodulatory mechanisms of AS-IV on UC.This study was constructed for DSS-induced acute colitis and recurrent colitis, with AS-IV administered prophylactically and therapeutically, respectively. The balance of Th17/Treg cells was analyzed by flow cytometry, their specific nuclear transcription factors were detected by RT-PCR as well as their secreted inflammatory cytokines were detected by ELISA and RT-PCR. Notch signaling-related proteins were detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Oxidative stress indicators were measured by biochemical technology.In this study, AS-IV treatment not only effectively prevented and alleviated the clinical symptoms of DSS-induced colitis mice, including weight loss, DAI soaring, colon length shortening and colon weight gain, but also significantly improved ulcer formation, inflammatory cell infiltration and index, and regulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines in colon tissues. Importantly, the efficacy of high-dose AS-IV (100 mg/kg/day) in mice with recurrent colitis in this study was comparable to that of 5-ASA. AS-IV early administration was able to reshape the homeostasis of Th17/Treg cells in mice with acute colitis; meanwhile, AS-IV inhibited Th17 cell responses and promoted Treg cell responses in mice with recurrent colitis. Moreover, AS-IV not only inhibited the activation of Notch signaling pathway in colitis mice, but also prevented and ameliorated DSS-induced oxidative stress injury.In conclusion, AS-IV effectively prevented and alleviated UC by reshaping Th17/Treg cell homeostasis and anti-oxidative stress.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier GmbH.

  Title: Mineralocorticoid receptor deficiency in Treg cells ameliorates DSS-induced colitis in a gut microbiota-dependent manner.
  Abstract: Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is a classic nuclear receptor and an effective drug target in the cardiovascular system. The function of MR in immune cells such as macrophages and T cells has been increasingly appreciated. The aim of this study was to investigate the function of Treg MR in the process of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We treated Treg MR-deficient (MRflox/flox Foxp3YFP-Cre , KO) mice and control (Foxp3YFP-Cre , WT) mice with dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) to induce colitis and found that the severity of DSS-induced colitis was markedly alleviated in Treg MR-deficient mice, accompanied by reduced production of inflammatory cytokines, and relieved infiltration of monocytes, neutrophils and interferon γ+ T cells in colon lamina propria. Faecal microbiota of mice with colitis was analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and the composition of gut microbiota was vastly changed in Treg MR-deficient mice. Furthermore, depletion of gut microbiota by antibiotics abolished the protective effects of Treg MR deficiency and resulted in similar severity of DSS-induced colitis in WT and KO mice. Faecal microbiota transplantation from KO mice attenuated DSS-induced colitis characterized by alleviated inflammatory infiltration compared to that from WT mice. Hence, our study demonstrates that Treg MR deficiency protects against DSS-induced colitis by attenuation of colonic inflammatory infiltration. Gut microbiota is both sufficient and necessary for Treg MR deficiency to exert the beneficial effects.© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

  Title: A patient with familial Mediterranean fever mimicking diarrhea-dominant irritable bowel syndrome who successfully responded to treatment with colchicine: a case report.
  Abstract: Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional gastrointestinal disease. Visceral hypersensitivity is the most important pathophysiology in irritable bowel syndrome. Currently, diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome is based on symptoms and exclusion of other organic diseases. Although the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome can be made based on the Rome IV criteria, one may speculate that complete exclusion of other organic diseases is not so easy, especially in cases uncontrolled with standard therapies.We present herein a case of familial Mediterranean fever in a young Japanese patient who had been suffering from an irritable bowel syndrome-like clinical course. A 25-year-old Japanese male had been diagnosed as having diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome 5 years earlier. Unfortunately, standard therapies failed to improve irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. After careful medical history-taking, we understood that he had also experienced periodic fever since 10 years ago. Although no mutation was identified in the Mediterranean fever gene, not only periodic fever but abdominal symptoms improved completely after colchicine administration. He was therefore diagnosed as having familial Mediterranean fever and that the abdominal symptoms may be related to the disease.Familial Mediterranean fever should be considered as a cause of irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms.© 2022.

  Title: Oral beclomethasone dipropionate as an add-on therapy and response prediction in Korean patients with ulcerative colitis.
  Abstract: We aimed to investigate the oral beclomethasone dipropionate's (BDP) efficacy as an add-on therapy and to clarify the predictive factor for response to oral BDP in Korean ulcerative colitis (UC) patients.Patients with a stable concomitant drug regimen with exposure to oral BDP (5 mg/day) within 30 days before BDP initiation were included. Partial Mayo score (pMS) was used to evaluate response to oral BDP. Clinical remission (CREM) was defined as a post-treatment pMS ≤ 1 point. Clinical response (CRES) was defined as an at least 2-point decrease in post-treatment pMS and an at least 30% decrease from baseline pMS. Patients without CREM or CRES were considered nonresponders (NRs).Of all, 37 showed CREM, 19 showed CRES, and 44 were NRs. The CREM group included more patients with mild disease activity (75.7% vs. 43.2%, p = 0.011) than NRs. In contrast to NRs, CREM and CRES patients showed significant improvement of post-treatment erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (ESR with p = 0.001, CRP with p = 0.004, respectively). Moreover, the initial rectal bleeding subscore (RBS) was significantly different between CREM and CRES, or NR (both with p &lt; 0.001). In multivariate analyses, initial stool frequency subscore (SFS) of 0 and RBS of 0 were predictive factors for CREM (odds ratio [OR], 15.359; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.085 to 217.499; p = 0.043 for SFS, and OR, 11.434; 95% CI, 1.682 to 77.710; p = 0.013 for RBS).Oral BDP is an efficacious add-on therapy in Korean UC patients. Patients with initial SFS or RBS of 0 may be particularly good candidates for oral BDP.

  Title: Cryptotanshinone ameliorates dextran sulfate sodium-induced murine acute and chronic ulcerative colitis via suppressing STAT3 activation and Th17 cell differentiation.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronically relapsing inflammatory disease in the intestinal tract. Current unsatisfactory treatments prompt people to seek for alternative therapies and drug candidates. Cryptotanshinone (CTS), a diterpene quinoneextractedfromthe roots ofSalviamiltiorrhiza, has recently been shown to inhibit acute colitis by reducing pro-inflammatory mediators. However, whether CTS can protect against chronic UC and its effect on T lymphocytes remain unknown. In this study, CTS (20, 60 mg/kg) showed potent inhibitory activity against dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced acute UC, as determined by weight loss, disease activity, colon length and histology. Similarly, in a model of DSS-induced chronic colitis, the administration of CTS prevented the disease progression with longer colon length, lower histological scores, and less expression of fibrosis-related collagen and α-smooth muscle actin in the colon. CTS also reduced the proportion of CD4+IL-17A+ Th17 cells in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes of mice with acute or chronic colitis. However, CTS at 20 mg/kg had no effect on regulatory T cells (Tregs). In addition, CTS reduced the phosphorylation of signal transduction and transcription activator 3 (STAT3) in DSS-treated colon tissue. Further study showed that CTS concentration-dependently suppressed the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into Th17 cells. CTS could not inhibit the activation and proliferation of T lymphocytes or attenuate the secretion of cytokines including IL-10, IL-2, IL-6 and IFN-γ, but could inhibit the production of IL-17A and TNF-α in Con A-stimulated splenocytes. CTS suppressed IL-6-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT3. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that CTS alleviated acute and chronic UC by suppressing STAT3 activation and Th17 cell differentiation, suggesting that it may be a promising candidate drug for the treatment of UC.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

  Title: Combining the HSP90 inhibitor TAS-116 with metformin effectively degrades the NLRP3 and attenuates inflammasome activation in rats: A new management paradigm for ulcerative colitis.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a prevalent type of inflammatory bowel diseases that may predispose patients to acquire colitis-related cancer if treatment was not effective. Despite the presence of an array of established treatment options, current modalities are not successful for a substanial number of patients. The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is critical in the development of inflammatory processes in the colon. Additionally, the regulation of NLRP3 via HSP90 inhibition is a potential target to treat UC. Moreover, during inflammation, autophagy allows the turnover of malfunctioning proteins and therefore stands as a viable strategy for inactivating NLRP3 inflammasomes and halting hyperinflammation. Herein, we evaluated the effect of autophagy induction using metformin in the context of HSP90 inhibition by TAS-116 in the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC in rats. We revealed that TAS-116-induced interruption of the protein complex containing HSP90 and NLRP3 might hamper and delay the start of the inflammatory cascade ensued by the NLRP3 inflammasome oligomerization. In such circumstances, the unprotected NLRP3 is subjected to autophagic degradation in an environment of metformin-promoted autophagic signaling. As a result, such dynamic synergy was efficient in combating colon damage and immune-cell infiltration. This was confirmed by the macroscopic and microscopic investigations. Further, biochemical analysis revealed subdued inflammation cascade and oxidative injury. Therefore, simultaneous administration of TAS-116 and metformin is a new management paradigm aimed at inducing malfunction in the NLRP3 followed by augmenting its autophagic degradation, respectively. However, further studies should be conducted to assess the reliability and consistency of this novel approach.Copyright © 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.. All rights reserved.

  Title: [Mechanism of Huanglian Houpo Decoction in treatment of ulcerative colitis in mice based on brain-gut axis].
  Abstract: Based on the brain-gut axis, the present study investigated the effect of Huanglian Houpo Decoction(HLHPD) in the treatment of ulcerative colitis(UC) and explored the mechanism in the regulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine(5-HT), substance P(SP), and vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) using modern technologies and molecular docking. Sixty male C57 BL/6 J mice were randomly divided into a blank control group, a model group, a sulfasalazine(SASP) group, and high-(5.00 g·kg~(-1)), medium-(2.50 g·kg~(-1)), and low-dose(1.25 g·kg~(-1)) HLHPD groups. The UC model was induced by oral administration of water containing 3% dextran sulfate sodium salt(DSS) in mice except those in the blank control group. After HLHPD was administered for 10 days, the mice were sacrificed for sample collection. Morphological changes of colon tissues were observed by HE staining. The expression of 5-HT, SP, VIP, tumor necrosis factor α(TNF-α), interleukin-6(IL-6), and interleukin-1β(IL-1β) in the hypothalamus, serum, and colon was determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA). The expression of tryptophan hydroxylase 1(TPH1), SP, and VIP in colon tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The expression of brain-gut peptide receptors, such as 5-HT3 A, neurokinin receptor 1(NK-1 R), and VIP receptor 1(VPAC1) in colon tissues was investigated by Western blot. The binding affinity of the brain-gut peptide receptors to the main components of HLHPD was analyzed by molecular docking. After HLHPD intervention, UC mice showed increased body weight, reduced DAI score and occult blood, prolonged colon, down-regulated levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in colon tissues, and relieved pathological damage in the colon. The VIP levels in the colon were significantly up-regulated in the HLHPD groups. The high-and medium-dose HLHPD could significantly down-regulated SP and 5-HT in colon tissues and 5-HT in the serum, and up-regulated the VIP in the serum. The high-dose HLHPD group could down-regulate 5-HT and up-regulate VIP in the hypothalamus. It is suggested that HLHPD can reverse the levels of brain-gut peptides in UC mice to varying degrees. Correlation analysis results suggested that the expression levels of brain-gut peptides in the hypothalamus, serum, and colon tissues were related to inflammatory factors. Molecular docking results showed that berberine, coptisine, and epiberberine were presumedly the material basis for HLHPD in regulating the levels of 5-HT3 A, NK-1 R, and VPAC1. The main components of HLHPD may reduce colonic inflammation and pathological damage of colon tissues by regulating the activity of brain-gut peptides and their receptors, thereby reducing DSS-induced colitis in mice.

  Abstract: Based on the brain-gut axis, the present study investigated the effect of Huanglian Houpo Decoction(HLHPD) in the treatment of ulcerative colitis(UC) and explored the mechanism in the regulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine(5-HT), substance P(SP), and vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) using modern technologies and molecular docking. Sixty male C57 BL/6 J mice were randomly divided into a blank control group, a model group, a sulfasalazine(SASP) group, and high-(5.00 g·kg~(-1)), medium-(2.50 g·kg~(-1)), and low-dose(1.25 g·kg~(-1)) HLHPD groups. The UC model was induced by oral administration of water containing 3% dextran sulfate sodium salt(DSS) in mice except those in the blank control group. After HLHPD was administered for 10 days, the mice were sacrificed for sample collection. Morphological changes of colon tissues were observed by HE staining. The expression of 5-HT, SP, VIP, tumor necrosis factor α(TNF-α), interleukin-6(IL-6), and interleukin-1β(IL-1β) in the hypothalamus, serum, and colon was determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA). The expression of tryptophan hydroxylase 1(TPH1), SP, and VIP in colon tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The expression of brain-gut peptide receptors, such as 5-HT3 A, neurokinin receptor 1(NK-1 R), and VIP receptor 1(VPAC1) in colon tissues was investigated by Western blot. The binding affinity of the brain-gut peptide receptors to the main components of HLHPD was analyzed by molecular docking. After HLHPD intervention, UC mice showed increased body weight, reduced DAI score and occult blood, prolonged colon, down-regulated levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in colon tissues, and relieved pathological damage in the colon. The VIP levels in the colon were significantly up-regulated in the HLHPD groups. The high-and medium-dose HLHPD could significantly down-regulated SP and 5-HT in colon tissues and 5-HT in the serum, and up-regulated the VIP in the serum. The high-dose HLHPD group could down-regulate 5-HT and up-regulate VIP in the hypothalamus. It is suggested that HLHPD can reverse the levels of brain-gut peptides in UC mice to varying degrees. Correlation analysis results suggested that the expression levels of brain-gut peptides in the hypothalamus, serum, and colon tissues were related to inflammatory factors. Molecular docking results showed that berberine, coptisine, and epiberberine were presumedly the material basis for HLHPD in regulating the levels of 5-HT3 A, NK-1 R, and VPAC1. The main components of HLHPD may reduce colonic inflammation and pathological damage of colon tissues by regulating the activity of brain-gut peptides and their receptors, thereby reducing DSS-induced colitis in mice.

  Title: Dasatinib-induced Crohn's-like colitis.
  Abstract: Dasatinib is a second-generation multityrosine kinase inhibitor used in the first-line and second-line treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukaemia. The most frequent type of Dasatinib-induced intestinal injury is haemorrhagic colitis; other morphologic patterns include apoptotic colopathy, CD8+ T-cell-mediated colitis and non-specific colitis. Aim of this study is to describe a novel Crohn's-like histopathologic pattern of Dasatinib-induced colitis. Four patients developed diarrhoea during Dasatinib treatment; colonoscopy was performed and biopsy sets were taken for histological analysis. All patients showed patchy, chronic active inflammation with cryptitis and microgranulomas (two patients). Ileal and rectal biopsies showed either no or mild, focal inflammation. An increase in lamina propria eosinophils was seen (two patients) and apoptoses were seen (three patients). Complete remission was observed after interruption of treatment. Dasatinib-induced colitis and Crohn's disease may share histologic features including microgranulomas, which can potentially lead to misdiagnosis if no information on treatment is provided.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

  Title: Functional bowel disorders with diarrhoea: Clinical guidelines of the United European Gastroenterology and European Society for Neurogastroenterology and Motility.
  Abstract: Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea (IBS-D) and functional diarrhoea (FDr) are the two major functional bowel disorders characterized by diarrhoea. In spite of their high prevalence, IBS-D and FDr are associated with major uncertainties, especially regarding their optimal diagnostic work-up and management. A Delphi consensus was performed with experts from 10 European countries who conducted a literature summary and voting process on 31 statements. Quality of evidence was evaluated using the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation criteria. Consensus (defined as >80% agreement) was reached for all the statements. The panel agreed with the potential overlapping of IBS-D and FDr. In terms of diagnosis, the consensus supports a symptom-based approach also with the exclusion of alarm symptoms, recommending the evaluation of full blood count, C-reactive protein, serology for coeliac disease, and faecal calprotectin, and consideration of diagnosing bile acid diarrhoea. Colonoscopy with random biopsies in both the right and left colon is recommended in patients older than 50 years and in presence of alarm features. Regarding treatment, a strong consensus was achieved for the use of a diet low fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols, gut-directed psychological therapies, rifaximin, loperamide, and eluxadoline. A weak or conditional recommendation was achieved for antispasmodics, probiotics, tryciclic antidepressants, bile acid sequestrants, 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 antagonists (i.e. alosetron, ondansetron, or ramosetron). A multinational group of European experts summarized the current state of consensus on the definition, diagnosis, and management of IBS-D and FDr.© 2022 The Authors.

  Title: Protective Effects of Grape Seed Proanthocyanidin Extract in Preventing DSS Induced Ulcerative Colitis Based on Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacokinetic and Tissue Distribution.
  Abstract: Based on pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution studies, we explored the potential effect of grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) -induced ulcerative colitis in mice and its underlying mechanism.A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method was developed to measure the content of five components of GSPE in rat plasma and tissue. After oral administration of GSPE, correlative index levels of interleukin- 1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), factor-α (TNF-α), Nitric Oxide (NO), malonaldehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were detected in the serum and colon tissues. The protein expression levels of HO-1, Nrf2 and NF-κB in the mouse colonic mucosa were analysed using immunohistochemistry.Pharmacodynamic tests showed substantially reduced mice body weight, diarrhea, and bloody stool in the model group. The pathological damage to the colonic mucosa of mice in the GSPE groups was remarkably reduced in a dose-dependent manner. The histopathological score of the colon in the model group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P <0.05), suggesting that DSS caused severe damage to the colon. After oral administration of GSPE, the serum and colonic tissue levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, NO, and MDA decreased, whereas SOD content increased. Moreover, the protein levels of NF-κB and Keap-1 were significantly decreased, whereas the expression levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 proteins increased (P<0.01) based on the results of the microwaveimmunohistochemical assay. The pharmacokinetic results showed that catechin, epicatechin, and procyanidins B1, B2, and B4 are widely distributed in the tissues and blood of rats and may accumulate in some tissues. Catechin and epicatechin peaked at 0.25 and 1.5 h for the first and second time, respectively. Procyanidin B1, B2, and B4 peaked at 0.5 and 1.5 h for the first and second time, respectively, owing to the effect of the hepato-enteric circulation. The active components of GSPE can reach the colon of the lesion site, and hepatoenteric circulation can increase the residence time of the active components in the body, further increasing the anti-ulcer activity.Our findings suggest that GSPE has a potential protective effect against DSS-induced ulcerative colitis in mice.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.

  Title: Lactoferrin for iron-deficiency anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a clinical trial.
  Abstract: Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) is common in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, oral iron supplements are commonly associated with poor compliance due to gastrointestinal side effects. We compared the effect of lactoferrin versus oral ferrous sulfate for the treatment of IDA in children with IBD.Ninety-two IBD children with IDA were included but only 80 children completed the study and they were randomized into two groups: ferrous sulfate group (n = 40) who received ferrous sulfate 6 mg/kg/day for 3 months and lactoferrin group (n = 40) who received lactoferrin 100 mg/day for 3 months. Complete blood count, serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin saturation (TS), serum ferritin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and hepcidin 25 were measured before and after the treatment.Hemoglobin (Hb), mean corpuscular volume, serum iron, TS, and serum ferritin significantly increased, while TIBC decreased significantly after the administration of either ferrous sulfate or lactoferrin compared to their baseline data. In addition, lactoferrin significantly increased Hb, serum iron, TS, and serum ferritin compared to ferrous sulfate. Moreover, lactoferrin significantly decreased IL-6 and hepcidin levels.Lactoferrin is a promising effective treatment with fewer side effects than oral elemental iron in children with IBD and IDA.The study was registered at www.pactr.org (PACTR202002763901803).Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is treated with oral iron therapy; however, oral iron supplements are commonly associated with poor compliance due to gastrointestinal side effects. To the best of our knowledge, our study was the first in pediatrics that compared the effect of lactoferrin versus oral ferrous sulfate as an iron supplement for the treatment of IDA in children with IBD. We found that lactoferrin is a promising effective treatment with fewer side effects than oral elemental iron in children with IBD and IDA.© 2022. The Author(s).

  Title: Novel drug delivery systems for inflammatory bowel disease.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic illness characterized by relapsing inflammation of the intestines. The disorder is stratified according to the severity and is marked by its two main phenotypical representations: Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Pathogenesis of the disease is ambiguous and is expected to have interactivity between genetic disposition, environmental factors such as bacterial agents, and dysregulated immune response. Treatment for IBD aims to reduce symptom extent and severity and halt disease progression. The mainstay drugs have been 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASAs), corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive agents. Parenteral, oral and rectal routes are the conventional methods of drug delivery, and among all, oral administration is most widely adopted. However, problems of systematic drug reactions and low specificity in delivering drugs to the inflamed sites have emerged with these regular routes of delivery. Novel drug delivery systems have been introduced to overcome several therapeutic obstacles and for localized drug delivery to target tissues. Enteric-coated microneedle pills, various nano-drug delivery techniques, prodrug systems, lipid-based vesicular systems, hybrid drug delivery systems, and biologic drug delivery systems constitute some of these novel methods. Microneedles are painless, they dislodge their content at the affected site, and their release can be prolonged. Recombinant bacteria such as genetically engineered Lactococcus Lactis and eukaryotic cells, including GM immune cells and red blood cells as nanoparticle carriers, can be plausible delivery methods when evaluating biologic systems. Nano-particle drug delivery systems consisting of various techniques are also employed as nanoparticles can penetrate through inflamed regions and adhere to the thick mucus of the diseased site. Prodrug systems such as 5-ASAs formulations or their derivatives are effective in reducing colonic damage. Liposomes can be modified with both hydrophilic and lipophilic particles and act as lipid-based vesicular systems, while hybrid drug delivery systems containing an internal nanoparticle section for loading drugs are potential routes too. Leukosomes are also considered as possible carrier systems, and results from mouse models have revealed that they control anti- and pro-inflammatory molecules.©The Author(s) 2022.

  Title: A case report of drug-induced liver injury due to the infliximab biosimilar CT-P13 on switching from original infliximab in a patient with Crohn's disease.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic immune disorders of unclear etiology. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors are effective for IBD treatment and are cost-effective because they reduce hospital admissions and are associated with fewer surgery requirements and a better quality of life in IBD patients. A large number of clinical trials of infliximab biosimilar (CT-P13) have suggested that the administration of biosimilars provides high efficacy and safety similar to that of the originators, with a lower cost, so switching from the original to a biosimilar is considered an acceptable treatment. While several abnormalities of blood examination have been observed in patients with CT-P13 administration, no cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) caused by CT-P13 has been reported. A 23-year-old woman had been diagnosed with Crohn's disease and was treated with original infliximab (O-IFX) for 9 years. She developed severe jaundice 1 month after switching from O-IFX to CT-P13. Serologic tests of autoimmune and hepatitis viruses were negative, and ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed no abnormalities. A liver biopsy showed prominent pericentral canalicular cholestasis, without features of steatosis or sclerosing cholangitis, which was consistent with drug-induced cholestasis. The cholestasis improved 10 weeks after the discontinuation of CT-P13, and no DILI redeveloped even after re-switching from CT-P13 to O-IFX. This is the first report of DILI due to switching from O-IFX to CT-P13.

  Title: A case report of drug-induced liver injury due to the infliximab biosimilar CT-P13 on switching from original infliximab in a patient with Crohn's disease.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic immune disorders of unclear etiology. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors are effective for IBD treatment and are cost-effective because they reduce hospital admissions and are associated with fewer surgery requirements and a better quality of life in IBD patients. A large number of clinical trials of infliximab biosimilar (CT-P13) have suggested that the administration of biosimilars provides high efficacy and safety similar to that of the originators, with a lower cost, so switching from the original to a biosimilar is considered an acceptable treatment. While several abnormalities of blood examination have been observed in patients with CT-P13 administration, no cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) caused by CT-P13 has been reported. A 23-year-old woman had been diagnosed with Crohn's disease and was treated with original infliximab (O-IFX) for 9 years. She developed severe jaundice 1 month after switching from O-IFX to CT-P13. Serologic tests of autoimmune and hepatitis viruses were negative, and ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed no abnormalities.

  Title: CD26 Deficiency Controls Macrophage Polarization Markers and Signal Transducers during Colitis Development and Resolution.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a multifactorial condition characterized by a destructive immune response that failed to be attenuated by common regulatory mechanisms which reduce inflammation and promote mucosa healing. The inhibition of CD26, a multifunctional glycoprotein that controls the immune response via its dipeptidyl peptidase (DP) 4 enzyme activity, was proven to have beneficial effects in various autoimmune inflammatory diseases. The polarization of macrophages into either pro-inflammatory M1 or anti-inflammatory M2 subclass is a key intersection that mediates the immune-inflammatory process in UC. Hence, we hypothesized that the deficiency of CD26 affects that process in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced model of UC. We found that mRNA expression of M2 markers arginase 1 and Fizz were increased, while the expression of M1 marker inducible NO synthase was downregulated in CD26-/- mice. Decreased STAT1 mRNA, as well as upregulated pSTAT6 and pSTAT3, additionally support the demonstrated activation of M2 macrophages under CD26 deficiency. Finally, we investigated DP8 and DP9, proteins with DP4-like activity, and found that CD26 deficiency is not a key factor for the noted upregulation of their expression in UC. In conclusion, we demonstrate that CD26 deficiency regulates macrophage polarization toward the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, which is driven by STAT6/STAT3 signaling pathways. This process is additionally enhanced by the reduction of M1 differentiation via the suppression of proinflammatory STAT1. Therefore, further studies should investigate the clinical potential of CD26 inhibitors in the treatment of UC.

  Title: Predicting Ulcerative Colitis Relapse in Clinical Remission With Fecal Immunochemical Occult Blood Test or Prostaglandin E-Major Urinary Metabolite.
  Abstract: The fecal immunochemical occult blood test (FIT) and prostaglandin E-major urinary metabolite (PGE-MUM) have been reported to predict the relapse of ulcerative colitis (UC) during remission. In this study, we directly compared FIT and PGE-MUM in predicting relapse and examined the effect of disease duration on these biomarkers.Measurements of 2 biomarkers and endoscopic examination were performed in 73 patients with UC in remission. The patients were followed up for 12 months, and clinical relapse was evaluated. In addition, we divided the patients into long-term disease duration and short-term disease duration groups for analysis.Twenty-one patients (28.8%) relapsed within 12 months. FIT and PGE-MUM levels were significantly higher in the relapsed group than in the remission group. Cutoff values of FIT and PGE-MUM for predicting relapse using receiver operating characteristic analysis were 65.0 ng/mL (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.723) and 25.2 μg/g·Cr (AUC: 0.701), respectively. Patients with FIT ≥ 65.0 ng/mL and PGE-MUM ≥ 25.2 μg/g·Cr had a higher risk of clinical relapse. In the short-term disease duration group, the AUCs of FIT were larger than those of PGE-MUM using receiver operating characteristic analysis, in most instances. By contrast, the AUCs of PGE-MUM were larger than those of FIT in most cases in the long-term disease groups.FIT and PEG-MUM were highly accurate in predicting clinical relapse in UC patients with short and long disease durations in remission, respectively.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

  Title: Jumping translocation involving chromosome 13q in a patient with Crohn's Disease and inv(16)(p13.1q22)/CBFB-MYH11 acute myeloid leukemia.
  Abstract: Jumping translocations (JT) are rare chromosomal rearrangements caused by the translocation of one donor chromosome segment to two or more recipient chromosomes. In the setting of myeloid neoplasms, JT are typically associated with disease transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and studies to date have found JT to be associated with poor prognosis and short overall survival. However, JT have been only very rarely reported in AML associated with a favorable AML prognostic cytogenetic marker. Additionally, JT have infrequently been described in hematological malignancies associated with autoimmune diseases (AID) such as Crohn's Disease (CD). Here we describe a case of a 40-year-old female with a 24-year history of CD diagnosed with AML harbouring the inv(16)(p13.1q22)/CBFB-MYH11 rearrangement in conjunction with sideline clones containing trisomy 13, tetrasomy 13, and a JT of chromosome 13q12 jumping to 7q32 and 18p11.2. The patient attained molecular remission one month post diagnosis after induction 7 + 3 chemotherapy. Morphologic relapse of disease occurred 27 months post diagnosis. A second molecular remission was attained 3 months later after re-induction chemotherapy. The patient received a sibling bone marrow transplant 32 months post diagnosis and is currently in remission 7 months post allogeneic transplant. To the best of our knowledge, this case represents the first report of JT occurring in inv(16)(p13.1q22)/CBFB-MYH11 AML and the second of JT occurring in an AML patient with prior clinical history of CD. This case provides further insight into the rare occurrence of JT in AML, particularly AML with a favorable cytogenetic marker in conjunction with AID.Copyright © 2022. Published by Elsevier Inc.

  Title: Beneficial Effects of Celastrol on Immune Balance by Modulating Gut Microbiota in Experimental Ulcerative Colitis Mice.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease caused by many factors including colonic inflammation and microbiota dysbiosis. Previous studies have indicated that celastrol (CSR) has strong anti-inflammatory and immune-inhibitory effects. Here, we investigated the effects of CSR on colonic inflammation and mucosal immunity in an experimental colitis model, and addressed the mechanism by which CSR exerts the protective effects. We characterized the therapeutic effects and the potential mechanism of CSR on treating UC using histological staining, intestinal permeability assay, cytokine assay, flow cytometry, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), 16S rRNA sequencing, untargeted metabolomics, and cell differentiation. CSR administration significantly ameliorated the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice, which was evidenced by the recovered body weight and colon length as well as the decreased disease activity index (DAI) score and intestinal permeability. Meanwhile, CSR down-regulated the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and up-regulated the amount of anti-inflammatory mediators at both mRNA and protein levels, and improved the balances of Treg/Th1 and Treg/Th17 to maintain the colonic immune homeostasis. Notably, all the therapeutic effects were exerted in a gut microbiota-dependent manner. Furthermore, CSR treatment increased the gut microbiota diversity and changed the compositions of the gut microbiota and metabolites, which is probably associated with the gut microbiota-mediated protective effects. In conclusion, this study provides the strong evidence that CSR may be a promising therapeutic drug for UC.Copyright © 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

  Title: Thromboprophylaxis Use in Paediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease: An International RAND Appropriateness Panel.
  Abstract: Thromboprophylaxis use in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is inconsistent. Current guidelines only support treating children with acute severe colitis with risk factors. We convened an international RAND panel to explore thromboprophylaxis in paediatric IBD inpatients in the context of new evidence.We convened a geographically diverse 14-person panel of paediatric gastroenterologists alongside supporting experts. An online survey was sent before an online meeting. Panellists were asked to rate the appropriateness of thromboprophylaxis in hospitalised paediatric IBD patients via 27 scenarios of varying ages, gender, and phenotype, with and without thrombotic risk factors. Anonymised results were presented at the meeting. A second modified survey was distributed to all panellists present at the meeting. Results from the second survey constitute the RAND panel results. The validated RAND disagreement index defined disagreement when ≥ 1.The combined outcome of thromboprophylaxis being considered appropriate until discharge and inappropriate to withhold was seen in 20 of 27 scenarios, including: all patients with new-onset acute severe colitis; all flares of known ulcerative colitis, irrespective of risk factors except in pre-pubescent patients with limited disease and no risk factors; and all Crohn's patients with risk factors. Disagreement was seen in five scenarios regarding Crohn's without risk factors, where outcomes were already uncertain.RAND panels are an established method to assess expert opinion in areas of limited evidence. This work therefore constitutes neither a guideline nor a consensus; however, the findings suggest a need to re-evaluate the role of thromboprophylaxis in future guidelines.© The Author(s) 2022.

  Title: Thromboprophylaxis Use in Paediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease: An International RAND Appropriateness Panel.
  Abstract: Thromboprophylaxis use in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is inconsistent. Current guidelines only support treating children with acute severe colitis with risk factors. We convened an international RAND panel to explore thromboprophylaxis in paediatric IBD inpatients in the context of new evidence.We convened a geographically diverse 14-person panel of paediatric gastroenterologists alongside supporting experts. An online survey was sent before an online meeting. Panellists were asked to rate the appropriateness of thromboprophylaxis in hospitalised paediatric IBD patients via 27 scenarios of varying ages, gender, and phenotype, with and without thrombotic risk factors. Anonymised results were presented at the meeting. A second modified survey was distributed to all panellists present at the meeting. Results from the second survey constitute the RAND panel results. The validated RAND disagreement index defined disagreement when ≥ 1.The combined outcome of thromboprophylaxis being considered appropriate until discharge and inappropriate to withhold was seen in 20 of 27 scenarios, including: all patients with new-onset acute severe colitis; all flares of known ulcerative colitis, irrespective of risk factors except in pre-pubescent patients with limited disease and no risk factors; and all Crohn's patients with risk factors. Disagreement was seen in five scenarios regarding Crohn's without risk factors, where outcomes were already uncertain.RAND panels are an established method to assess expert opinion in areas of limited evidence. This work therefore constitutes neither a guideline nor a consensus; however, the findings suggest a need to re-evaluate the role of thromboprophylaxis in future guidelines.© The Author(s) 2022.

  Title: Functional bowel symptoms in the general population (Review).
  Abstract: Several patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) do not seek medical attention for their symptoms. When patients with IBS seek help, the majority of them are handled at primary healthcare centers, whereas research studies are performed at tertiary healthcare centers. The present study aimed to summarize findings from >4,000 participants of the general population included in the Malmö Offspring Study (inclusion rate 46.7%). The participants were clinically examined, their blood and fecal samples collected, and their questionnaires completed. The participants were divided into subjects with or without self‑reported IBS and those having functional gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in the past 2 weeks. The presence of IBS and GI symptoms in the participants were associated with each other. Zonulin levels did not differ between participants with or without GI diseases and were not associated with the degree of GI symptoms. The parameters low body weight at birth and small for gestational age were associated with the degree of the symptoms' influence on daily life. IBS and GI symptoms were positively associated with Blautia abundance. Beta‑diversity differed between participants with or without these two conditions. Positive correlations were noted between the degree of diarrhea and the mean 24‑h measurements of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate. Both IBS and GI symptoms were associated with female sex, smoking, stress, poor sleeping habits, unemployment, drug use, and a family history of GI diseases, whereas younger age was inversely associated with IBS and its associated symptoms. In conclusion, only a limited number of medical findings could be identified in participants with IBS and GI symptoms, whereas sociodemographic and environmental conditions were associated with these entities.

  Title: C-reactive protein levels and prevalence of leukopenia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with azathioprine and/or mesalazine: a real-life study.
  Abstract: To examine serum C-reactive protein levels and the prevalence of leukopenia in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis undergoing treatment with azathioprine and/or mesalazine.Retrospective observational study based on clinical and laboratory data collected from medical records of 76 adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with azathioprine, mesalazine or both. Sex, age, diagnosis, number of blood samples and elevated serum C-reactive protein levels during the follow-up period were recorded. The following variables were analyzed in terms of C-reactive protein levels and leukopenia episodes: sex, age, diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease and type of drug. Statistical analyses included multiple logistic regression and the Fisher's exact test for qualitative variables.Leukopenia was observed in 18.4% of patients and was associated with older age and higher doses of medication. In 44% of patients, C-reactive protein levels were high. However, symptoms were not associated with abnormal levels of this marker.Regardless of symptoms, serum C-reactive protein levels were not a reliable indicator of controlled inflammatory bowel disease. Leukopenia was independently associated with older age and higher doses of medication and is a common side effect, which should be routinely monitored.

  Title: Trifolirhizin regulates the balance of Th17/Treg cells and inflammation in the ulcerative colitis mice through inhibiting the TXNIP-mediated activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic and recurrent autoimmune disease, characterized by recurrence and remission of mucosal inflammation. Although the understanding of the pathogenesis of UC has been improved, effective therapeutic drugs are required for treating patients with UC. In current work, the mouse model of colitis was established. Trifolirhizin was demonstrated to improve symptom in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice. The body weight of mice was elevated, whereas the disease activity index (DAI) was reduced. Moreover, trifolirhizin was involved in inhibition of inflammation and regulation of the balance of T helper 17 (Th 17) cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells in DSS-induced colitis mice. Further, the activation NLRP3 inflammasome was suppressed by trifolirhizin in DSS-induced colitis mice. Trifolirhizin was also identified to regulate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) pathway. The trifolirhizin-mediated anti-inflammatory effect was inhibited by suppressing AMPK in DSS-induced UC mice. In summary, the research suggested that administration of trifolirhizin significantly improved the symptoms and the pathological damage in DSS-induced UC mice. Trifolirhizin regulated the balance of Th17/Treg cells and inflammation in the UC mice through inhibiting the TXNIP-mediated activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

  Title: Limited Dose-Dependent Effects of Vedolizumab on Various Leukocyte Subsets.
  Abstract: The anti-α4β7 integrin antibody vedolizumab (VDZ) is successfully used for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. However, only a subgroup of patients respond to therapy. VDZ is administered at a fixed dose, leading to a wide range of serum concentrations in patients. Previous work from our group showed a dose-dependent preferential binding of VDZ to effector compared with regulatory CD4 + T cells. Therefore, we aimed to determine the dose-dependent binding profile of VDZ to other leukocyte subsets.We characterized α4β7 integrin expression on CD8 + T cells, CD19 + B cells, CD14 + monocytes, natural killer cells, and eosinophils from patients with inflammatory bowel disease and healthy controls. We studied the binding of VDZ to these cells at different concentrations and investigated the functional consequences for dynamic adhesion and transmigration in vitro .The expression of α4β7 differed between the analyzed leukocyte subsets and was significantly higher on eosinophils from inflammatory bowel disease patients compared with controls. Almost all α4β7-expressing cells from these subsets were bound by VDZ at a concentration of 10 μg/mL. Dynamic cell adhesion was significantly impaired in all subsets, but there were no dose-dependent differences in the inhibition of adhesion.Our data suggest that α4β7-expressing CD8 + T cells, CD19 + B cells, CD14 + monocytes, natural killer cells, and eosinophils are a target of VDZ. However, there do not seem to be concentration-dependent differences, regarding the effects on these cells in the clinically relevant range. Thus, the reported exposure-efficacy characteristic of VDZ can probably mainly be attributed to CD4 + T-cell subsets.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

  Title: Study on the mechanism of Huangqin Decoction on rats with ulcerative colitis of damp-heat type base on mtDNA, TLR4, p-PI3K, p-Akt protein expression and microbiota.
  Abstract: Huangqin decoction (HQD), composed of Scutellaria(Huangqin), Peony(Shaoyao), Liquorice(Gancao) and Jujube(Dazao), is a traditional Chinese medicine prescription, originated from treatise on Febrile Diseases, has the functions of clearing heat, stopping benefits and relieving pain. It is the original prescription for treating heat and relieving dysentery, and is commonly used in clinic for diarrhea and other diseases. In ulcerative colitis, damp-heat syndrome is the most common. However, its mechanism of action is not completely clear.The purpose of the research is to investigate the protective effect of HQD on ulcerative colitis rats and the regulation effect of mitochondrial DNA, TLR4, p-Akt, p-PI3K protein and microbiota.The effects of HQD anti-UC were investigated by fluorescence quantitative PCR, cytokine level and histopathological analysis in DSS-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) rats. The content of mtDNA in colon epithelial cells of rats in each group was detected by fluorescence quantitative PCR, p-PI3K, p-Akt and TLR4 protein expressions in colon tissues of rats in each group were detected by Western blotting. IL-6, IL-17 and IL-23 inflammatory factors were detected by ELISA. The effect of HQD on intestinal microbiota of rats with ulcerative colitis was studied by high-throughput sequencing technology, and the correlation between mtDNA level and inflammatory factors as well as protein expression in colonic epithelium of rats with ulcerative colitis was analyzed by SPSS23.0.HQD significantly alleviated UC symptoms by improving the mucosal intestinal epithelial cell structure, mental state, hair gloss, fecal occult blood, lamina propria intestinal glands and inflammatory cell infiltration. And HQD reduced the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the colonic epithelium of UC rats Production of IL-6, IL-17 and IL-23. The HE stained section of colon tissue showed a complete intestinal epithelial mucosal layer structure. The structure of epithelial cells was more normal and abundant. There were more goblet cells in lamina propria adenoma, which improved the infiltration of inflammatory cells. HQD significantly inhibited the mtDNA content in rat colonic epithelial tissue, and significantly inhibited the expression of TLR4, p-PI3K and p-Akt inflammatory signaling pathways. The results of the microbiota experiment showed that the abundance of HQD in the phylum Firmicutes increased, and the number of Bacteroides phylum decreased (p < 0.05). At the genus level, HQD significantly increased Lactobacillus and Firmicutes Bacteroides, while Treponema and Bacteroides were significantly reduced (p < 0.05).HQD has a certain protective effect on rats with damp heat ulcerative colitis. Its mechanism may be related to regulating the expression of p-PI3K, p-Akt and TLR4 proteins, mitochond

  Title: Interleukin-23 in the Pathogenesis of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Implications for Therapeutic Intervention.
  Abstract: The interleukin-23 [IL-23] cytokine, derived predominantly from macrophages and dendritic cells in response to microbial stimulation, has emerged as a critical promoter of chronic intestinal inflammation. Genome-wide association studies linking variants in IL23R to disease protection, bolstered by experimental evidence from colitis models, and the successful application of therapies against the IL-12/IL-23 shared p40 subunit in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] all provide compelling evidence of a crucial role for IL-23 in disease pathogenesis. Moreover, targeting the p19 subunit specific for IL-23 has shown considerable promise in recent phase 2 studies in IBD. The relative importance of the diverse immunological pathways downstream of IL-23 in propagating mucosal inflammation in the gut, however, remains contentious. Here we review current understanding of IL-23 biology and explore its pleiotropic effects on T cells, and innate lymphoid, myeloid and intestinal epithelial cells in the context of the pathogenesis of IBD. We furthermore discuss these pathways in the light of recent evidence from clinical trials and indicate emerging targets amenable to therapeutic intervention and translation into clinical practice.© The Author(s) 2022.

The relative importance of the diverse immunological pathways downstream of IL-23 in propagating mucosal inflammation in the gut, however, remains contentious. Here we review current understanding of IL-23 biology and explore its pleiotropic effects on T cells, and innate lymphoid, myeloid and intestinal epithelial cells in the context of the pathogenesis of IBD. We furthermore discuss these pathways in the light of recent evidence from clinical trials and indicate emerging targets amenable to therapeutic intervention and translation into clinical practice.© The Author(s) 2022.

  Title: Preliminary evaluation of serum zonulin in canine chronic enteropathies.
  Abstract: In humans, serum zonulin, a biomarker of intestinal permeability, correlates with underlying enteropathies and has potential application as a therapeutic target. The aim of this study was to evaluate serum zonulin as a biomarker for canine chronic enteropathy.Prospective enrolment of twenty-one client-owned dogs with at least 1 of the following gastrointestinal (GI) signs for at least 3 weeks duration: anorexia, hyporexia, dysrexia, vomiting, weight loss or diarrhea. 21 control dogs, age and breed matched, were also enrolled. Dogs with gastrointestinal signs were diagnosed with chronic enteropathy based on a complete blood count, serum chemistry, specific canine pancreatic lipase, cobalamin, resting cortisol, abdominal ultrasound and gastrointestinal endoscopy with histopathology. Enrolled control dogs had an unremarkable physical examination, complete blood count, serum chemistry and no clinical signs of gastrointestinal disease. Dogs were ineligible if antibiotics or immunosuppressive medications were administered within 1 month of enrolment. Blood samples were analysed using a commercial canine serum zonulin quantitative ELISA.Dogs with chronic enteropathies had median serum zonulin values of 0.28 ng/mL (interquartile range: 0.04-2.59), while control dogs of 0.27 ng/mL (0.05-3.67). There was no significant difference in canine serum zonulin levels between these populations. The estimated difference in the median concentrations was -0.01 ng/mL (95% CI: -0.23 to 0.89).In this study, using a commercial canine zonulin ELISA, serum zonulin levels did not differentiate between dogs with chronic enteropathies and control dogs.© 2022 British Small Animal Veterinary Association.

  Title: Cell division control 42 elevates during infliximab therapy, and its increment relates to treatment response in ulcerative colitis patients.
  Abstract: Cell division control 42 (CDC42) regulates multiple processes of inflammation and/or immunity in autoimmune diseases and also relates to the treatment efficacy of biologic regimens clinically. This study aimed to explore the longitudinal change in CDC42 during infliximab (IFX) treatment and its correlation with IFX response in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients.Active UC patients (N = 48) who received IFX were recruited, and their CDC42 expressions in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were detected before treatment (W0) and at 12 weeks after treatment (W12) using RT-qPCR. Also, CDC42 in PBMCs from UC patients with remission (N = 20) and health controls (HCs) (N = 20) were detected.CDC42 was reduced in active UC patients compared with UC patients with remission (p = 0.014) and HCs (p < 0.001). Besides, CDC42 was negatively correlated with CRP (p = 0.025), TNF-α (p = 0.024), IL-1β (p = 0.045), IL-17A (p = 0.039), and Mayo score (p = 0.015) in active UC patients, but did not relate to ESR, disease duration, or IL-6 (all p > 0.05), while CDC42 was only negatively related to CRP in UC patients with remission (p = 0.046). Interestingly, CDC42 was increased at W12 after IFX treatment in active UC patients (p < 0.001). Specifically, CDC42 was elevated during treatment in active UC patients with IFX response (p < 0.001), but did not obviously change in those without IFX response (p = 0.061). Furthermore, CDC42 at W12 was higher in active UC patients with IFX response compared with those without IFX response (p = 0.049).Cell division control 42 serves as a potential biomarker for monitoring disease progression and IFX response in UC patients.© 2022 The Authors.

  Title: Efficacy and safety of empagliflozin in glycogen storage disease type Ib: Data from an international questionnaire.
  Abstract: This paper aims to report collective information on safety and efficacy of empagliflozin drug repurposing in individuals with glycogen storage disease type Ib (GSD Ib).This is an international retrospective questionnaire study on the safety and efficacy of empagliflozin use for management of neutropenia/neutrophil dysfunction in patients with GSD Ib, conducted among the respective health care providers from 24 countries across the globe.Clinical data from 112 individuals with GSD Ib were evaluated, representing a total of 94 treatment years. The median age at start of empagliflozin treatment was 10.5 years (range = 0-38 years). Empagliflozin showed positive effects on all neutrophil dysfunction-related symptoms, including oral and urogenital mucosal lesions, recurrent infections, skin abscesses, inflammatory bowel disease, and anemia. Before initiating empagliflozin, most patients with GSD Ib were on G-CSF (94/112; 84%). At the time of the survey, 49 of 89 (55%) patients previously treated with G-CSF had completely stopped G-CSF, and another 15 (17%) were able to reduce the dose. The most common adverse event during empagliflozin treatment was hypoglycemia, occurring in 18% of individuals.Empagliflozin has a favorable effect on neutropenia/neutrophil dysfunction-related symptoms and safety profile in individuals with GSD Ib.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

  Title: Modulation of GPCR receptors common to gut inflammatory diseases and neuronal disorders, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases as druggable targets through Withania somnifera bioactives: an in silico study.
  Abstract: Microorganisms in human gastrointestinal tract have profound influence on the transformation of food into metabolites which can impact human health. Along with playing crucial roles in regulating and modulating various metabolic reactions and life processes, dysbiosis of gut microbiota also affects the permeability of gut and blood-brain barrier. This increases the chance of age-related neurological disorders' like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Withania somnifera (W. somnifera) has been proclaimed as a virtuous plant for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and many other problems. We have studied the bioactive components of W. somnifera for combined treatment of gut-dysbiosis led bowel diseases (Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Irritable Bowel Syndrome) and the most common neurodegenerative diseases through common potential targets. This approach can solve along with curing the neurodegenerative diseases, the factors causing these diseases would also be obstructed from entering the brain, consonantly curing Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Our work on GPCR receptors common to gut inflammatory diseases and neuronal disorders through Network Pharmacology, Molecular docking and Dynamic Simulation approach has shown that modulation of these receptors with bioactive compounds present in W. somnifera can result in effective control of these diseases. We have found five proteins (HTR1A, HTR1B, HTR2A, HTR2B & HTR7) and five best lead compounds (Withanolide A, B, E, Q & Anahygrine) against these targets after molecular docking analysis. Our simulation studies have finally shown that amongst these five HTR1A and HTR7 proteins are the best targets with the leads Withanolide E and Withanolide A against them, respectively.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

  Title: Xuanfei Baidu decoction attenuates intestinal disorders by modulating NF-κB pathway, regulating T cell immunity and improving intestinal flora.
  Abstract: A number of studies have shown that gastrointestinal manifestations co-exist with respiratory symptoms in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Xuanfei Baidu decoction (XFBD) was recommended by the National Health Commission to treat mild and moderate COVID-19 patients and proved to effectively alleviate intestinal symptoms. However, the exact mechanisms remain elusive.This study aimed at exploring potential mechanisms of XFBD by utilizing a mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced acute experimental colitis, mimicking the disease conditions of intestinal microecological disorders.The network pharmacology approach was employed to identify the potential targets and pathways of XFBD on the intestinal disorders. Mice with DSS-induced intestinal disorders were utilized to evaluate the protective effect of XFBD in vivo, including body weight, disease activity index (DAI) score, colon length, spleen weight, and serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) level. Colon tissues were used to perform hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, western blot analysis, and transcriptome sequencing. Macrophages, neutrophils and the proportions of T helper cell (Th) 1 and Th2 cells were measured by flow cytometry. Intestinal contents were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing.Network pharmacology analysis indicated that XFBD inhibited the progression of COVID-19-related intestinal diseases by repressing inflammation. In mice with DSS-induced intestinal inflammation, XFBD treatment significantly reduced weight loss, the spleen index, the disease activity index, TNF-α levels, and colonic tissue damage, and prevented colon shortening. Transcriptomics and flow cytometry results suggested that XFBD remodeled intestinal immunity by downregulating the Th1/Th2 ratio. Western blot analysis showed that XFBD exerted its anti-inflammatory effects by blocking the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Indicator analysis of microbiota showed that 75 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were affected after XFBD administration. Among them, Akkermansia, Muribaculaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Enterorhabdus were simultaneously negatively correlated with intestinal disorders' parameters, and Bacteroides, Escherichia-Shigella, Eubacterium nodatum,Turicibacter, and Clostridium sensu stricto 1, showed positive correlations with intestinal disorders' parameters.Our data indicate that XFBD treatment attenuated intestinal disorders associated with inhibiting inflammation, remodeling of intestinal immunity, and improving intestinal flora. These findings provide a scientific basis for the clinical use of XFBD and offer a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with intestinal symptoms.Copyright © 2022.

  Title: Effects of CB2 and TRPV1 Stimulation on Osteoclast Overactivity Induced by Iron in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Abstract: The reduction of bone mineral density and osteoporosis have high impacts on the health of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). We have previously shown that a dysregulated iron metabolism occurs in IBD and leads to a decrease in circulating iron concentration and excessive intracellular sequestration of iron.

  Title: Effects of CB2 and TRPV1 Stimulation on Osteoclast Overactivity Induced by Iron in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Abstract: The reduction of bone mineral density and osteoporosis have high impacts on the health of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). We have previously shown that a dysregulated iron metabolism occurs in IBD and leads to a decrease in circulating iron concentration and excessive intracellular sequestration of iron. Studies suggest that iron overload significantly affects the bone, accelerating osteoclast (OC) differentiation and activation, promoting bone resorption. Moreover, we demonstrated that iron overload causes OC overactivity. The cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2) and the transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 (TRPV1) are potential therapeutic targets for bone diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the roles of CB2 and TRPV1 receptors and of iron in the development of osteoporosis in pediatric IBD.We differentiated OCs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with IBD and healthy donors and evaluated CB2 and TRPV1 receptor expression; OC activity, and iron metabolism by Western blot, TRAP assays, bone resorption assays, and iron assays.

  Title: 1,5-Disubstituted Acylated 2-Amino-4,5-dihydroimidazoles as a New Class of Retinoic Acid Receptor-Related Orphan Receptor (ROR) Inhibitors.
  Abstract: A growing body of evidence suggests a pathogenic role for pro-inflammatory T helper 17 cells (Th17) in several autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, type I diabetes, and psoriasis-diseases for which no curative treatment is currently available. The nuclear retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors alpha and gamma (RORα/γ), in particular the truncated isoform RORγt that is specifically expressed in the thymus, play a critical role in the activation of a pro-inflammatory Th17 response, and RORγ inverse agonists have shown promise as negative regulators of Th17 for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Our study underscores the screening of a large combinatorial library of 1,5-disubstituted acylated 2-amino-4,5-dihydroimidazoles using a demonstrated synthetic and screening approach and the utility of the positional scanning libraries strategy for the rapid identification of a novel class of ROR inhibitors. We identified compound 1295-273 with the highest activity against RORγ (3.3 µM IC50) in this series, and almost a two-fold selectivity towards this receptor isoform, with 5.3 and 5.8 µM IC50 against RORα and RORβ cells, respectively.

  Title: 2', 4'-Dihydroxy-2,3-dimethoxychalcone: A pharmacological inverse agonist of RORγt ameliorating Th17-driven inflammatory diseases by regulating Th17/Treg.
  Abstract: Multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease and organ transplant rejection are related to Th17 cell development and inflammatory respond. RORγt, a specific transcription factor regulating Th17 cell differentiation, is a pivotal target for the treatment of diseases. However, the clinical application of RORγt inverse agonists reported so far has been hindered due to limited efficacy and toxic side effects. Plant-derived natural products with drug-like properties and safety are wide and valuable resources for candidate drug discovery. Herein, structure-based virtual screening was used to find out 2',4'-Dihydroxy-2,3-dimethoxychalcone (DDC), a chalcone derivative rich in plants and food, located in the binding pocket of RORγt and targeted to inhibit RORγt activity. DDC repressed murine Th17 differentiation and promoted Treg differentiation remarkably in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, DDC treatment improved experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis recovery, ameliorated experimental colitis severity, and prevented graft rejection significantly. Mechanically, DDC indirectly stabilized Foxp3 expression by inhibiting RORγt activity and the expression of its target gene profile in vitro and in vivo, which realized its regulation of Th17/Treg balance. In conclusion, our study provides a scientific basis that DDC, as an inverse agonist of RORγt with simple structure, rich sources, low cost, high efficiency, and low toxicity, has great potential for the development of a novel effective immunomodulator for the treatment of Th17-mediated inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

  Title: Eosinophilic Duodenal Ulcer Exacerbation after Helicobacter pylori Eradication in a 14-Year-Old Boy.
  Abstract: Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs) cause various gastrointestinal symptoms due to infiltration of eosinophils into the gastrointestinal tract. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a microorganism that is associated with various diseases such as autoimmune diseases. In recent years, H. pylori is considered protective in inflammatory bowel diseases and gastrointestinal autoimmune disorders but is not known to be protective in EGIDs. A 14-year-old boy presented with epigastric pain and nausea, without diarrhea. His symptoms were not associated with meals. Blood examination showed an eosinophil count of 1,666 cells/µL (17.0%) and an interleukin-5 (IL-5) level of less than 3.9 pg/mL. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed chronic gastritis and duodenal ulcers. Capsule endoscopy and colonoscopy showed no abnormal findings. The patient was diagnosed with chronic gastritis due to H. pylori infection and eosinophilic duodenal ulcers. H. pylori eradication was performed. However, the abdominal pain worsened with elevated peripheral eosinophil count [2,314/µL (26%)] and serum IL-5 level (8.0 pg/mL). Montelukast administration improved the symptoms and laboratory findings [peripheral eosinophil count, 330/µL (5.9%); IL-5, < 3.9 pg/mL]. EGIDs should be considered as a cause of duodenal ulcers. H. pylori may be protective in EGIDs. Montelukast monotherapy may be considered as a first line treatment for eosinophilic duodenal lesions.

  Title: Interleukin-36β exacerbates DSS-induce acute colitis via inhibiting Foxp3+ regulatory T cell response and increasing Th2 cell response.
  Abstract: interleukin (IL)-36β is a member of the IL-36 subfamily of the IL-1 family. Usually, serum levels of IL-36β are higher in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), indicating that IL-36β has a pathophysiological role in IBD. At the time of writing, no studies were published reporting the role of IL-36β in modulating T cell-mediated immune responses in gastrointestinal inflammation. This research aimed to determine the function of IL-36β in regulating T cells in mice with colitis caused by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS).recombinant IL-36β (rIL-36β) was administered by intraperitoneal injection to mice with DSS-induced colitis. Clinical symptoms, colon length, and histological changes were determined. The production of cytokines was measured by ELISA. The help T (Th) cell subsets were measured by flow cytometry. The expression of mRNA of IL-36β was measured by quantitative real-time PCR.there was an increased expression of IL-36 in the inflamed colonic mucosa of mice with DSS-induced acute colitis. Mice treated with recombinant IL-36β (rIL-36β) were more susceptible to DSS-induced colitis than PBS-treated mice. Moreover, spontaneous inflammatory cytokines produced by neutrophils greatly increased in the lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL) of rIL-36β-treated animals with DSS-induced colitis. Besides, rIL-36β-treatment dramatically elevated Th2 cell responses but significantly downregulated Foxp3+ regulatory T cell (Treg) responses.these findings indicate that IL-36β enhances the pathology of DSS-induced colitis in mice by promoting Th2 responses in LPL while decreasing Foxp3+ Treg responses. Thus, we propose the regulation of the IL-36β/IL-36R signaling pathway as a potential biological treatment for IBD.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

  Title: The role of AMPK-dependent pathways in cellular and molecular mechanisms of metformin: a new perspective for treatment and prevention of diseases.
  Abstract: Metformin can suppress gluconeogenesis and reduce blood sugar by activating adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inducing small heterodimer partner (SHP) expression in the liver cells. The main mechanism of metformin's action is related to its activation of the AMPK enzyme and regulation of the energy balance. AMPK is a heterothermic serine/threonine kinase made of a catalytic alpha subunit and two subunits of beta and a gamma regulator. This enzyme can measure the intracellular ratio of AMP/ATP. If this ratio is high, the amino acid threonine 172 available in its alpha chain would be activated by the phosphorylated liver kinase B1 (LKB1), leading to AMPK activation. Several studies have indicated that apart from its significant role in the reduction of blood glucose level, metformin activates the AMPK enzyme that in turn has various efficient impacts on the regulation of various processes, including controlling inflammatory conditions, altering the differentiation pathway of immune and non-immune cell pathways, and the amelioration of various cancers, liver diseases, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), kidney diseases, neurological disorders, etc. Metformin's activation of AMPK enables it to control inflammatory conditions, improve oxidative status, regulate the differentiation pathways of various cells, change the pathological process in various diseases, and finally have positive therapeutic effects on them. Due to the activation of AMPK and its role in regulating several subcellular signalling pathways, metformin can be effective in altering the cells' proliferation and differentiation pathways and eventually in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.© 2022.

  Title: Composite Sophora Colon-Soluble Capsule Ameliorates DSS-Induced Ulcerative Colitis in Mice via Gut Microbiota-Derived Butyric Acid and NCR+ ILC3.
  Abstract: To investigate the effects of composite Sophora colon-soluble Capsule (CSCC) on gut microbiota-mediated short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production and downstream group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) mice model.The main components of CSCC were analyzed by hybrid ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography ion mobility spectromety quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-IM-QTOF/MS). Twenty-four male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=6) by using a computer algorithm-generated random digital, including control, DSS model, mesalazine, and CSCC groups. A DSS-induced colitis mice model was established to determine the effects of CSCC by recording colonic weight, colonic length, index of colonic weight, and histological colonic score. The variations in ILC3s were assessed by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. The results of gut microbiota and SCFAs were acquired by 16s rDNA and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The expression levels of NCR+ ILC3-, CCR6+ Nkp46- (Lti) ILC3-, and ILCreg-specific markers were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively.The main components of CSCC were matrine, ammothamnine, Sophora flavescens neoalcohol J, and Sophora oxytol U. After 7 days of treatment, CSCC significantly alleviated colitis by promoting the reproduction of intestinal probiotics manifested as upregulation of the abundance of Bacteroidetes species and specifically the Bacteroidales_S24-7 genus (P<0.05). Among the SCFAs, the content of butyric acid increased the most after CSCC treatment. Meanwhile, compared with the model group, Lti ILC3s and its biomarkers were significantly downregulated and NCR+ ILC3s were significantly elevated in the CSCC group (P<0.01). Further experiments revealed that ILC3s were differentiated from Lti ILC3s to NCR+ ILC3s, resulting in interleukin-22 production which regulates gut epithelial barrier function.CSCC may exert a therapeutic effect on UC by improving the gut microbiota, promoting metabolite butyric acid production, and managing the ratio between NCR+ ILC3s and Lti ILC3s.© 2022.

  Title: Composite Sophora Colon-Soluble Capsule Ameliorates DSS-Induced Ulcerative Colitis in Mice via Gut Microbiota-Derived Butyric Acid and NCR+ ILC3.
  Abstract: To investigate the effects of composite Sophora colon-soluble Capsule (CSCC) on gut microbiota-mediated short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production and downstream group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) mice model.The main components of CSCC were analyzed by hybrid ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography ion mobility spectromety quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-IM-QTOF/MS). Twenty-four male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=6) by using a computer algorithm-generated random digital, including control, DSS model, mesalazine, and CSCC groups. A DSS-induced colitis mice model was established to determine the effects of CSCC by recording colonic weight, colonic length, index of colonic weight, and histological colonic score. The variations in ILC3s were assessed by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. The results of gut microbiota and SCFAs were acquired by 16s rDNA and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The expression levels of NCR+ ILC3-, CCR6+ Nkp46- (Lti) ILC3-, and ILCreg-specific markers were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively.The main components of CSCC were matrine, ammothamnine, Sophora flavescens neoalcohol J, and Sophora oxytol U. After 7 days of treatment, CSCC significantly alleviated colitis by promoting the reproduction of intestinal probiotics manifested as upregulation of the abundance of Bacteroidetes species and specifically the Bacteroidales_S24-7 genus (P<0.05).

  Title: Bupi Yichang Pill alleviates dextran sulfate sodium-induced ulcerative colitis in mice by regulating the homeostasis of follicular helper T cells.
  Abstract: Follicular helper T (Tfh) cells-based therapy represents a new treatment option for inflammatory bowel disease. Bupi Yichang Pill (BPYCP), a traditional Chinese formula for the treatment of dysentery and diarrhea, exhibits potential anti-inflammatory activities in treating various kinds of inflammation. However, its anti-inflammatory effect on colitis and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown.To explore the protective role and underlying immunomodulatory effects of BPYCP in the treatment of UC.The dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) free-drinking method induced UC in C57BL/6 mice, and BPYCP was orally administrated at a dosage of 1.5, 3.0, or 6.0 g/kg/day. Throughout the experimental period, the effects of BPYCP on DSS-induced clinical symptoms and disease activity index (DAI) were monitored and analyzed. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to observe the histopathological injury of the colon. Flow cytometry was used to detect the levels of Tfh cells, Tfh cell subpopulations, and memory Tfh cells. ELISA, Western blot, and qRT-PCR were used to detect the expression of inflammatory cytokines and Tfh cell-related biomarkers.Medium and high dosages of BPYCP effectively alleviated DSS-induced experimental colitis with increased body weight, survival rate and colonic length, and decreased DAI, colonic weight, and colonic index, as well as less ulcer formation and inflammatory cell infiltration, increased anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17A, IL-6, and TNF-ɑ. Moreover, BPYCP administration significantly decreased the percentage of Tfh cells and the expression of Tfh markers ICOS, PD-1 and Bcl-6 in the mesenteric lymph nodes of colitis mice. In addition, BPYCP treatment obviously decreased the percentages of Tfh1, Tfh17 and Tem-Tfh cells and upregulated Tfr cells in colitis mice. However, there were no significant regulatory effects of BPYCP on Tfh cell response in normal mice.Taken together, these results demonstrated a protective effect of BPYCP against DSS-induced experimental colitis by regulating Tfh cell homeostasis.Copyright © 2022.

  Title: Association between preoperative biologic use and surgical morbidity in patients with Crohn's disease.
  Abstract: We evaluated the influence of preoperative treatments with biologics on surgical morbidity in patients with Crohn's disease (CD).We reviewed the surveillance data of patients with CD who underwent surgery between April 2018 and April 2021. The possible risk factors for morbidity were analyzed.A total of 305 surgically treated patients were included. Anti-TNF alpha agents and ustekinumab were used in 92 and 27 patients, respectively, within 12 weeks before surgery. There were no cases of mortality. In total, 70/305 (23.0%) patients developed a complication, and 42/305 (13.8%) patients developed a surgical site infection (SSI) (17 incisional SSIs and 35 organ/space SSIs). Current smoking status (OR 3.44), emergent/urgent surgery (OR 6.85), and abdominoperineal resection (APR) (OR 14.93) were identified as risk factors for total complications. Penetrating disease (OR 14.55) was identified as a risk factor for incisional SSIs. Current smoking status (OR 7.09), an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score greater than 3 (OR 5.85), a postoperative blood sugar level over 155 mg/dL (OR 4.37), and APR (OR 207.95) were identified as risk factors for organ/space SSIs.No correlation between preoperative treatment with biologics and surgical mortality or morbidity was found. However, we should perform further analyses on a larger number of patients because the analyses may be limited by selection bias for treatment and several confounding factors.© 2022.

  Title: Correlation Between Crohn's Disease Activity and Serum Selenium Concentration.
  Abstract: Accurate and reliable evaluation of Crohn's disease (CD) activity is crucial for monitoring and treating the disease; however, it is challenging. There is a high demand for new, reliable, and noninvasive biomarkers for estimating CD activity. Selenium deficiency is common in patients with CD; however, its correlation with disease severity remains unclear. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of using serum selenium concentration as an additional biomarker for determining the severity of CD.This retrospective study included consecutive Asian patients aged 18 to 60 years and hospitalized for CD between May 2020 and December 2020 at the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center (Hangzhou, China). Patients with a history of extensive small intestinal surgery and/or short bowel syndrome were excluded from analysis. Serum selenium concentration was determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Disease severity was evaluated based on inflammatory markers (simple endoscopic score for CD, CD activity index, Harvey-Bradshaw index, serum C-reactive protein level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and platelet count) and markers of nutrition status (body mass index; blood hemoglobin and hematocrit; as well as serum levels of albumin, folic acid, and vitamin D). The correlations between serum selenium level and disease severity-related parameters were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses.The study included 94 men and 41 women. Serum selenium level was significantly and inversely associated with all tested disease activity-related parameters by univariate analysis (all, P < 0.05). Further multivariate analysis showed that the simple endoscopic score for CD and serum levels of albumin and folic acid were significantly and independently correlated with serum selenium level (all, P < 0.05).Serum selenium concentration was inversely correlated with endoscopic disease severity in these Asian patients with CD. It is feasible to use serum selenium level as an additional biomarker for assessing and monitoring disease activity. The present results might have been influenced by geographic region, sample size, and/or dietary factors. Serum selenium level and other indicators of CD activity measured before and after treatment may provide more useful clinical information.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

  Title: AJM300 (carotegrast methyl), an oral antagonist of α4-integrin, as induction therapy for patients with moderately active ulcerative colitis: a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study.
  Abstract: AJM300 is an oral, small-molecule α4-integrin antagonist. We assessed the efficacy and safety of AJM300 in patients with moderately active ulcerative colitis.This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study consisted of two phases: a treatment phase and an open-label re-treatment phase. The study was done at 82 hospitals and clinics in Japan. Patients with a Mayo Clinic score of 6-10, endoscopic subscore of 2 or more, rectal bleeding subscore of 1 or more, and an inadequate response or intolerance to mesalazine were enrolled. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) via a website to either AJM300 (960 mg) or placebo by the minimisation method, which was adjusted centrally by dynamic assignment against the Mayo Clinic score (≥6 to ≤7, ≥8 to ≤10 points), any use of corticosteroid, anti-TNFα antibody, or immunosuppressants during the disease-active period (yes vs no), duration of induction therapy until randomisation (<4 weeks vs ≥4 weeks) as the minimisation factors. Patients, investigators, site staff, assessors, and the sponsor were masked to treatment assignments. The study drug was administered orally, three times daily, for 8 weeks, and continued for up to 24 weeks if endoscopic remission was not achieved or rectal bleeding did not stop. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a clinical response at week 8, and was analysed in the full analysis set. Clinical response was defined as a reduction in Mayo Clinic score of 30% or more and 3 or more, a reduction in rectal bleeding score of 1 or more or rectal bleeding subscore of 1 or less, and an endoscopic subscore of 1 or less at week 8. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03531892, and is closed to recruitment.Between June 6, 2018, and July 22, 2020, 203 patients were randomly assigned to AJM300 (n=102) or placebo (n=101). At week 8, 46 (45%) patients in the AJM300 group and 21 (21%) patients in the placebo group had a clinical response (odds ratio 3·30, 95% CI 1·73-6·29; p=0·00028). During the 8-week treatment and 16-week extension treatment periods, adverse events occurred in 39 (39%) of 101 patients in the placebo group and 39 (38%) of 102 patients in the AJM300 group. We found no difference in the incidence of adverse events between groups or after repeated administration of AJM300. The most common adverse event was nasopharyngitis (11 [11%] of 101 patients in the placebo group and ten [10%] of 102 patients in the AJM300 group). The most common treatment-related adverse event was also nasopharyngitis (four [4%] of 101 patients in the placebo group and three [3%] of 102 patients in the AJM300 group).

  Title: Acute transverse myelitis in an adult-patient with underlying ulcerative colitis: a case report.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease that limits to colon mucosa, which characterised by relapsing and remitting abdominal pain and diarrhea. Neurological complications in UC patients are usually underestimated. The most frequently reported neurological disorders associated with UC are peripheral neuropathy, cerebrovascular disease and demyelinating disease. However, acute transverse myelitis (TM) is rarely reported in UC patients.We report a case of a 39-year-old man presented with fatigue, muscle weakness, numbness in the lower limbs and fingers with underlying UC. Laboratory results revealed elevated neutrophil count, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Strip-shaped high signal intensity was identified in the cervical and thoracic spinal cord on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Acute TM was diagnosed. Significant improvements after intravenous high-dose methylprednisolone were observed.We speculate that acute TM may be the extraintestinal manifestation of UC, which may be related to the abnormalities of cell-mediated and humoral immunity rather than the side effect of mesalazine.© 2022.

Significant improvements after intravenous high-dose methylprednisolone were observed.We speculate that acute TM may be the extraintestinal manifestation of UC, which may be related to the abnormalities of cell-mediated and humoral immunity rather than the side effect of mesalazine.© 2022.

  Title: Vedolizumab Antagonizes MAdCAM-1-Dependent Human Placental Cytotrophoblast Adhesion and Invasion In Vitro.
  Abstract: Anti-α4β7 (Vedolizumab) treats inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by blocking the interaction between integrin α4β7 on leukocytes and mucosal addressin cell-adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) on the gut endothelium. Women with IBD often require continuing biologic therapy during pregnancy to avoid disease flare. To date, there have been no reports of an increase in adverse events with Vedolizumab use during pregnancy. Notably, integrins play a major role in human placental development during pregnancy. It is unknown whether Vedolizumab disrupts placental cell (cytotrophoblast) invasion and/or adhesion by blocking interactions with MAdCAM-1. We therefore investigated human placental expression of MAdCAM-1, the role of MAdCAM-1/α4β7 interactions in cytotrophoblast invasion/adhesion in vitro, and whether Vedolizumab administration in vivo alters the placental structure.Histological sections of placentas from normal pregnancies were evaluated for MAdCAM-1 expression by immunofluorescence. The impacts of Vedolizumab or anti-integrin β7 on human cytotrophoblast invasion and adhesion were assessed. Histology results from term placentas of 2 patients with IBD receiving Vedolizumab were compared to those of untreated healthy controls.Placental MAdCAM-1 expression was predominantly associated with invading extravillous cytotrophoblasts at the maternal-fetal interface. Treatment of isolated primary cytotrophoblasts with Vedolizumab or anti-integrin β7 significantly reduced Matrigel invasion, adherence to a MAdCAM-1-coated substrate, and interactions with HuT-78 cells. Placentas from 2 Vedolizumab-treated patients with IBD exhibited pronounced pathologic features as compared to healthy control specimens.This study revealed a previously unrecognized role for α4β7 and MAdCAM-1 in human placentation. More clinical and histological data from Vedolizumab-treated pregnant patients will be necessary to determine whether this medication poses any risk to the mother and fetus.© The Author(s) 2022.

  Title: Possible Curative Effects of Boric Acid and Bacillus clausii Treatments on TNBS-Induced Ulcerative Colitis in Rats.
  Abstract: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are two chronic relapsing inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Although there are several treatment options available to improve the symptoms of IBD patients, there is no effective treatment that provides a definitive solution. In the present study, we aim to investigate the antioxidative/anti-inflammatory effects of oral administration of boric acid and Bacillus clausii in a rat trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis model. The effects of boric acid and B. clausii were examined in serum and colon tissues with the help of some biochemical and histological analyses. Elevated inflammation and oxidative damage were found in the blood and colon tissue samples in the TNBS-induced group according to the complete blood count (CBC), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, interleukin-35 (IL-35), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), myeloperoxidase (MPO), nitric oxide (NO), and histological findings. Particularly, the highest IL-35 level (70.09 ± 12.62 ng/mL) in the combined treatment group, highest catalase activity (5322 ± 668.1 U/mg protein) in the TNBS-induced group, and lower relative expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in the TNBS-induced group than the control group were striking findings. According to our results, it can be concluded that boric acid showed more curative effects, even if B. clausii probiotics was partially ameliorative.© 2022.

  Title: [Effect of Sishen Pills and its split prescriptions on Tfr/Tfh9/Tfh17 cells in colitis mice].
  Abstract: This study aims to investigate the regulatory effect of Sishen Pills(SSP) and its split prescriptions Ershen Pills(EP) and Wuweizi Powder(WP) on T follicular helper(Tfh) cell subset in the dextran sodium sulfate(DSS)-induced colitis mice and the mechanism. A total of 60 male SPF BALB/c mice were used, 10 of which were randomly selected as the normal group. The rest 50 were induced with 3% DSS solution for colitis modeling. After modeling, they were randomized into 5 groups: model group, SSP group, EP group, WP group, and mesalazine group. Body mass, colon mass, colon mass index, colon length, and unit colon mass index in each group were observed. After hematoxylin-eosin(HE) staining, the pathological injury of colon tissue was scored. The expression levels of molecules related to the STAT/SOCS signaling pathway in colon tissues were analyzed by Western blot. Differentiation levels of Tfh cells such as CD4~+CXCR5~+IL-9~+(Tfh9), CD4~+CXCR5~+IL-17~+(Tfh17), and CD4~+CXCR5~+Foxp3~+(Tfr) in peripheral blood of mice were detected by flow cytometry. The results showed each treatment group demonstrated significant increase in body mass and colon length, decrease in colon mass, colon mass index, unit colon mass index, and histopathological score(P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01), reduction of the expression of p-STAT3, STAT3, p-STAT6, and STAT6(P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01), rise of the expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3(P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01), decrease of Tfh9 and Tfh17 cells, and increase of Tfr cells(P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01) compared with the model group. These results indicated that SSP and the split EP and WP may alleviate ulcerative colitis by inhibiting the activation of STAT/SOCS signaling pathway and regulating the balance of Tfr/Tfh9/Tfh17 cells.

  Title: No increased risk of flare in ulcerative colitis patients in corticosteroid-free remission after stopping 5-aminosalicylic acid: A territory-wide population-based study.
  Abstract: Whether 5-aminosalicylic acid (ASA) can be stopped in patients with stable ulcerative colitis (UC) remains unclear. We aimed to examine whether 5-ASA can be safely withdrawn in UC patients who have been in corticosteroid-free clinical remission for ≥ 1 year.This is a retrospective cohort study using territory-wide healthcare database in Hong Kong. Primary outcome was development of UC flare, defined as new corticosteroid use or UC-related hospitalizations within 5 years. UC patients on oral 5-ASA ≥ 2 g daily for ≥ 1 year with C-reactive protein (CRP) < 10 mg/dL and no 5-ASA dosage escalation, UC-related hospitalization or corticosteroid use in the past year were included. Patients on biological agents were excluded. Patients were classified as "stopping" if 5-ASA was withdrawn for ≥ 90 days within follow-up period. We performed multivariable Cox regression models adjusting for demographics, blood parameters and immunosuppressants used. Adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was reported comparing stopping and continuous-use groups.A total of 1408 patients were included with a median follow-up duration of 41.8 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 17.2-60.0 months). Stopping 5-ASA was not associated with an increased risk of UC flare (aHR 0.91; 95% CI 0.64-1.31; P = 0.620). A higher CRP levels at the time of stopping 5-ASA (aHR 1.15; 95% CI: 1.01-1.30; P = 0.037) were associated with increased risk of flare.Stopping 5-ASA in UC patients in corticosteroid-free remission for ≥ 1 year was not associated with increased risk of flare. Future prospective trials should evaluate the role of stopping 5-ASA in stable UC patients.© 2022 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

  Title: Neutrophils and micronuclei: An emerging link between genomic instability and cancer-driven inflammation.
  Abstract: Two recent studies by Bui and Butin-Israeli et al. have established the novel contribution of neutrophils to genomic instability induction and aberrant shaping of the DNA repair landscape, particularly observed in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and/or progressive colorectal cancer (CRC). In addition, these back-to-back studies uncovered a sharp increase in the numbers of micronuclei and lagging chromosomes in pre-cancerous and cancerous epithelium in response to prolonged PMN exposure. Given the emerging link between neutrophils and micronuclei as well as the established role of micronuclei in cGAS/STING activation, this special commentary aims to elaborate on the mechanisms by which CRC cells may adapt to neutrophil-driven genomic instability while concurrently sustain an inflamed tumor niche. We postulate that such tumor microenvironment with constant immune cell presence, inflammatory milieu, and cumulative DNA damage can drive tumor adaptation and resistance to therapeutic interventions. Finally, we discuss potential novel therapeutic approaches that can be leveraged to target this emerging neutrophil-micronuclei pathological axis, thereby preventing perpetual CRC inflammation and unwanted tumor adaptation.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

  Title: Exogenous Annexin 1 inhibits Th17 cell differentiation induced by anti-TNF treatment via activating FPR2 in DSS-induced colitis.
  Abstract: Anti-TNF treatment has played a vital role in treating Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). However, T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which facilitate the development of IBD, are not reduced and even increased during anti-TNF clinical studies. Therefore, inhibition of Th17 cells is of great significance for improving anti-TNF treatment.DSS-induced colitis mice were treated with the anti-TNF nanobody V7 and ANX1, and the variation in intestinal Th17 cells and DCs was estimated by flow cytometry. RAW264.7 cells were used to study the differentiation mechanism of Th17 cells from colon and mesenteric lymphocyte nodes (mLN).Intestinal Th17 cells increased after DSS-induced colitis was well treated with V7 (10 mg/kg). Th17 cell differentiation induced by V7 was accounted for by the accumulation of the V7-TNF complex, which was phagocytized by lamina propria (LP) DCs and induced the upregulation of MHCII. V7-TNF complex phagocytized RAW264.7 (CPR) was constructed and directly induced Th17 cell differentiation in colon LPLs and mLN in vitro. After knocking down CIITA in RAW264.7 cells, the induction was inhibited. Furthermore, Annexin 1 (ANX1) was upregulated and activated the FPR2-STAT3 pathway to inhibit the differentiation of Th17 cells. Then, animal assay demonstrated that ANX1 (500 μg/kg) enhanced the therapeutic effect of V7 (10 mg/kg) on DSS-induced colitis accompanied by a decrease in Th17 cells in mLN and colon.The differentiation of Th17 cells induced by V7 was mediated by phagocytosis of V7-TNF complexes by DCs and regulated by exogenous ANX1 via activation of the FPR2-STAT3 pathway. The combination of V7 and ANX1 presented a better therapeutic effect than monotherapy on DSS-induced colitis.Copyright © 2022. Published by Elsevier B.V.

  Title: Exogenous Annexin 1 inhibits Th17 cell differentiation induced by anti-TNF treatment via activating FPR2 in DSS-induced colitis.
  Abstract: Anti-TNF treatment has played a vital role in treating Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). However, T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which facilitate the development of IBD, are not reduced and even increased during anti-TNF clinical studies. Therefore, inhibition of Th17 cells is of great significance for improving anti-TNF treatment.DSS-induced colitis mice were treated with the anti-TNF nanobody V7 and ANX1, and the variation in intestinal Th17 cells and DCs was estimated by flow cytometry. RAW264.7 cells were used to study the differentiation mechanism of Th17 cells from colon and mesenteric lymphocyte nodes (mLN).Intestinal Th17 cells increased after DSS-induced colitis was well treated with V7 (10 mg/kg). Th17 cell differentiation induced by V7 was accounted for by the accumulation of the V7-TNF complex, which was phagocytized by lamina propria (LP) DCs and induced the upregulation of MHCII. V7-TNF complex phagocytized RAW264.7 (CPR) was constructed and directly induced Th17 cell differentiation in colon LPLs and mLN in vitro. After knocking down CIITA in RAW264.7 cells, the induction was inhibited. Furthermore, Annexin 1 (ANX1) was upregulated and activated the FPR2-STAT3 pathway to inhibit the differentiation of Th17 cells. Then, animal assay demonstrated that ANX1 (500 μg/kg) enhanced the therapeutic effect of V7 (10 mg/kg) on DSS-induced colitis accompanied by a decrease in Th17 cells in mLN and colon.The differentiation of Th17 cells induced by V7 was mediated by phagocytosis of V7-TNF complexes by DCs and regulated by exogenous ANX1 via activation of the FPR2-STAT3 pathway. The combination of V7 and ANX1 presented a better therapeutic effect than monotherapy on DSS-induced colitis.Copyright © 2022. Published by Elsevier B.V.

  Title: Efficacy of Wumei Baijiang prescription on regulatory T cells / helper T cells Immune balance in mice with ulcerative coliti.
  Abstract: To observe the therapeutic effect of Wumei Baijiang prescription empirical prescription of Lu Zhizheng, on experimental ulcerative colitis (UC) mice, and to investigate the mechanism of the prescription in UC from the perspective of the immune balance of regulatory T cells (Treg) and helper T cells (Th17).Sixty C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into 6 groups: normal group, model group, Chinese medicine group (high, medium and low dose group of Wumei Baijiang prescription) and control group (mesalazine sustained-release granules). Except for the normal group, the other groups used 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium to induce UC mice model. At the end of the model, the Chinese medicine group was given high, medium and low dose administration of Wumei Baijiang prescription, the control group was given slow-release granules of mesalazine, and the model group was given equal volume saline for 10 d. The changes of food intake, body weight, disease activity index (DAI) score, length of large intestine and histopathology were observed. The number of Treg, Th17, CD4+, CD8+ cells in spleen was detected by flow cytometry. The expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in serum was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.The middle and high-dose groups of Wumei Baijiang prescription were superior to the model group in terms of increasing food intake and body weight of colitis mice, restoring colon morphology, improving pathological damage, and reducing DAI (P < 0.05). There was no statistical difference with the mesalazine group (P > 0.05). Compared with the model group, the spleen Treg and CD4+ of the mice in the high and middle dose groups of Wumei Baijiang prescription were higher, while Th17 and CD8+ were lower (P < 0.05), and there was no statistical difference compared with the mesalazine group (P > 0.05). In addition, compared with the model group, the serum levels of TNF- and CRP in mice with high and middle doses of Wumei Baijiang prescription and mesalazine group were lower (P < 0.05), and IL-10 content was higher ( P < 0.05).Wumei Baijiang prescription can improve the general conditions of colitis mice, such as diarrhea, hematochezia, weight loss, and mucosal damage. The mechanism may be related to the regulation of Treg/Th17 immune balance.

  Title: Nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15) loss-of-function variants in an Australian inflammatory bowel disease population.
  Abstract: Thiopurine-related adverse events such as leukopenia, liver dysfunction and pancreatitis are associated with variants in the NUDT15 gene. Loss-of-function (low or no enzyme activity) alleles are more common in Asian and Hispanic populations. The prevalence of these variants in the Australian inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) population has not yet been reported.To evaluate the presence of NUDT15 loss-of-function alleles *2,*3,*9 in the Australian IBD population.The NUDT15 screening cohort included 423 IBD patients from Brisbane, Australia. Study patients were recruited by: (i) retrospective review of clinical charts for thiopurine-related severe adverse events; (ii) pathology data (white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts). NUDT15 genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-high-resolution melt (HRM), TaqMan genotyping and Sanger sequencing.NUDT15 mutation R139C (allele *3) was identified in 8 of 423 (1.9%) IBD patients. Seven of eight patients were R139C heterozygous (C/T) and one patient was R139C homozygous (T/T). One of the C/T group and the T/T patient developed thiopurine-induced myelosuppression (TIM) within 60 days of dosing. One patient in the C/T group developed TIM after 60 days of thiopurine dosing. The remaining five patients in the C/T group did not show TIM; however, other thiopurine-related events could not be ruled out and therefore careful monitoring over a long period is recommended.This is the first study to report the frequency of NUDT15 haplotypes *2,*3,*9 in an Australian IBD population. The most common variant detected was the R139C mutation. PCR and Sanger sequencing are efficient and cost-effective approaches for NUDT15 genotyping.© 2022 The Authors.

  Title: Berberine ameliorates DSS-induced intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction through microbiota-dependence and Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an idiopathic, chronic inflammatory disorder of the colon, and it has become one of the world-recognized medical problems as it is recurrent and refractory. Berberine (BBR) is an effective drug for UC treatment. However, the underlying mechanism and targets remain obscure. In this study, we systematically investigated the therapeutic effect and its mechanism of BBR in ameliorating DSS-induced mouse colitis. Expectedly, the colon inflammation was significantly relieved by BBR, and microbiota depletion by antibiotic cocktail significantly reversed the therapeutic effect. Further studies showed that BBR can regulate the abundance and component of bacteria, reestablish the broken chemical and epithelial barriers. Meanwhile, BBR administration dramatically decreased ILC1 and Th17 cells, and increased Tregs as well as ILC3 in colonic tissue of DSS-induced mice, and it was able to regulate the expression of various immune factors at the mRNA level. Moreover, a proteomic study revealed that Wnt/β-catenin pathway was remarkably enhanced in colonic tissue of BBR-treated mice, and the therapeutic effect of BBR was disappeared after the intervention of Wnt pathway inhibitor FH535. These results substantially revealed that BBR restores DSS-induced colon inflammation in a microbiota-dependent manner, and BBR performs its protective roles in colon by maintaining the structure and function of the intestinal mucosal barrier, regulating the intestinal mucosal immune homeostasis and it works through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Importantly, these findings also provided the proof that BBR serves as a potential gut microbiota modulator and mucosal barrier protector for UC prevention and therapy.© The author(s).

  Title: Chronic Use of Proton Pump Inhibitors Is Associated With an Increased Risk of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Colitis in Renal Cell Carcinoma.
  Abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become a standard of care in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) but are associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs) including colitis. Growing evidence suggests proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) increase the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Given the pathophysiological overlap between IBD and ICI colitis, we sought to evaluate the relationship between PPI use and ICI colitis in mRCC patients.We performed a retrospective study of adult patients who received ICI therapy for mRCC between 2015 and 2018 at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center affiliated hospitals. Clinical characteristics, oncological outcomes, ICI colitis details, and PPI use details were collected by manual chart review. The diagnosis of ICI colitis was made via biopsy when available, or by clinical criteria (symptoms and response to immunosuppressive therapy) when biopsy specimens were unavailable or inconclusive. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the potential contribution of PPIs to ICI colitis.A total of 176 patients received ICI therapy for mRCC, of which 16 (9.1%) were diagnosed with ICI colitis. Patients with ICI colitis presented with elevated stool lactoferritin and calprotectin and a wide range of endoscopic and histologic findings. There were no significant differences between patients with and without ICI colitis in age, gender, medical comorbidities, RCC history, and overall survival. However, exposure to ipilimumab and PPI use were more frequently observed in patients with ICI colitis than those without. In univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses, exposure to ipilimumab and chronic use of PPIs > 8 weeks were significantly associated with ICI colitis.In addition to ipilimumab use, chronic use of PPIs may be associated with ICI colitis in patients with mRCC.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

  Title: Prognostic Value of Colonic Tissue and Blood Eosinophils in Ulcerative Colitis.
  Abstract: It has been suggested that eosinophils may be a prognostic marker of disease outcome in ulcerative colitis (UC), but conflicting data exist. The objective was to investigate the extent of mucosal eosinophils and peripheral blood eosinophil count in newly diagnosed UC patients and to investigate its predictive value in short- and long-term disease outcomes.The degree of eosinophilia in baseline colonic biopsies and blood of newly diagnosed UC patients was retrospectively analyzed. It was investigated if tissue and blood eosinophilia could be a marker of a severe phenotype of UC, defined as the need for corticosteroids or immunomodulators in the first year or treatment with therapeutic monoclonal antibodies or colectomy during follow-up. Time to therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and time to colectomy were also evaluated as outcomes.There were 103 UC patients (median age 26 years) included. Median tissue peak eosinophil count (PEC) was 70.0 and median peripheral blood eosinophil count was 0.3 × 109/L at diagnosis. Tissue PEC (r = -0.161, P = .104) and blood eosinophil count (r = 0.022, P = .877) were not correlated with the severity of histologic inflammation. Logistic regression analyses did not identify PEC and blood eosinophil count as predictors of more severe disease outcomes. Tissue PEC and peripheral blood eosinophil count did not predict the time the initiation of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies or colectomy.Baseline tissue or peripheral blood eosinophils are not markers of disease activity and cannot be used as a predictor of severe disease outcomes in both adults and children with UC.© 2022 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

  Title: MAdCAM-1 Costimulates T Cells through Integrin α4β7 to Cause Gene Expression Events Resembling Costimulation through CD28.
  Abstract: Successful treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with the anti-integrin α4β7 mAb vedolizumab suggests that interaction of this integrin with addressin mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) is central to IBD pathogenesis. Although this was presumed to be due to an inhibition of lymphocyte trafficking to the gut, as has been observed in animal models, we report no depletion of CD4 T cells from the colonic mucosa as a consequence of vedolizumab treatment in humans, regardless of efficacy. Likewise, no upregulation of alternative trafficking mechanisms was observed as a consequence of therapy to suggest that this homeostasis is maintained in patients by a mechanistic escape from inhibition. Instead, we explore a role for MAdCAM-integrin interaction as a gut-specific costimulatory signal, demonstrating that it can replace CD28 ligation to activate human T cells in vitro. This activation through integrin α4β7 is mediated through the gut-restricted molecule MAdCAM-1, and it cannot be replicated by matrix molecules or proteins that bind other integrins. A detailed analysis of mRNA expression by human T cell subsets following suboptimal TCR stimulation in the presence or absence of CD28 versus MAdCAM-1 costimulation reveals marked similarity in the effect that these two signals have upon T cells, with temporal or quantitative differences detected in the expression of cytokines associated with Th17 cells or pyogenic inflammation. Thus, we describe an alternative costimulatory pathway for T cells in the intestine, through ligation of integrin α4β7 by MAdCAM-1, which may explain the therapeutic efficacy of vedolizumab and have implications concerning the treatment of IBD.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

  Title: Lycium barbarum Polysaccharides and Capsaicin Inhibit Oxidative Stress, Inflammatory Responses, and Pain Signaling in Rats with Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Colitis.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory disease with chronic relapsing symptoms. This study investigated the effects of Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBP) and capsaicin (CAP) in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC rats. Rats were divided into normal, DSS-induced UC, and UC treated with 100 mg LBP/kg bw, 12 mg CAP/kg bw, or 50 mg LBP/kg bw and 6 mg CAP/kg bw. Rats were fed LBP or CAP orally by gavage for 4 weeks, and UC model was established by feeding 5% DSS in drinking water for 6 days during week 3. Oral CAP and mixture significantly reduced disease activity index. Oral LBP significantly decreased serum malondialdehyde, interleukin (IL)-6, colonic tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels, and protein expression of transient receptor potential cation channel V1 (TRPV1) and transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), but increased serum catalase activity. Oral CAP significantly suppressed serum IL-6, colonic TRPV1 and TRPA1 protein expression, but elevated IL-10 levels, serum superoxide dismutase and catalase activities. The mixture of LBP and CAP significantly reduced serum IL-6, colonic TNF-α and TRPA1 protein. In conclusion, administration of LBP and/or CAP attenuate DSS-induced UC symptoms through inhibiting oxidative stress, proinflammatory cytokines, and protein expression of TRPV1 and TRPA1.

  Title: Cyanidin-3-O-Glucoside Supplement Improves Sperm Quality and Spermatogenesis in a Mice Model of Ulcerative Colitis.
  Abstract: Impaired fertility and low sperm quality are the global health problem with high attention. It has been noted that inflammation may impact fertility by affecting testicular spermatogenesis. Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside is a natural functional pigment with various health benefits. Nevertheless, studies on the mechanism by which C3G protects male reproduction in mice with ulcerative colitis remain scarce. The purpose of this study is to illustrate the potential mechanism of C3G for improving impaired fertility caused by colitis. A DSS-induced colitis model was applied to assess the effects of sperm quality with colitis and the health benefit role of C3G. Results indicated that C3G-treated mice exhibited higher body weight, longer colon length, less crypt damage and focal inflammation infiltration. Being consistent with that, low sperm count, low testis weight, high inflammation levels and abnormal thickness of seminiferous epithelium also observed in the DSS group were significantly recovered upon C3G treatment. These findings suggested that colitis has a close link to impaired fertility. Further analysis found that C3G could significantly suppress the inflammatory mediators in serum. Results conjointly indicated that C3G might improve the impaired fertility of mice with colitis by inhibiting inflammatory cytokines through the blood-testis barrier. C3G could be a promising daily supplement for ameliorating impaired fertility caused by colitis.

  Title: Safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic study of sibofimloc, a novel FimH blocker in patients with active Crohn's disease.
  Abstract: Expression of FimH adhesin by invasive Escherichia coli in the gastrointestinal tract of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) facilitates binding to epithelial glycoproteins and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Sibofimloc is a first-in-class FimH blocker that showed little systemic absorption in healthy volunteers. The current study evaluated systemic absorption, safety, and effect on inflammatory biomarkers of sibofimloc in patients with CD.This was an open-label, multicenter phase 1b study in adults with active CD. In part 1, two patients received a single oral dose of 3000-mg sibofimloc followed by 1500 mg b.i.d. for 13 days. In part 2, six patients received 1500-mg sibofimloc b.i.d. for 13 days. Blood was drawn for pharmacokinetic and biomarker analysis, and stool was collected for biomarker and microbiome analysis.Eight patients with active ileal or ileocolonic CD were enrolled into the study. Systemic sibofimloc exposure was low. Sibofimloc was well tolerated with only grade 1-2 events observed. Several pro-inflammatory biomarkers, including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and calprotectin, were decreased in stool by end of study.This first study of the novel FimH blocker, sibofimloc, in patients with active CD demonstrated minimal systemic exposure with good tolerance, while decreasing several inflammatory biomarkers.

  Title: Protective effect of naringin ameliorates TNBS-induced colitis in rats via improving antioxidant status and pro-inflammatory cytokines.
  Abstract: Aim: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that disturbs the colon mucosal lining and is characterized by oxido-nitrosative stress and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Naringin (NG) belongs to a group of chemicals called bioflavonoids derived from grapefruit and related citrus species. NG has been widely used as folk medicine in many countries, due to its several health benefits.Method: This study examined the effect of NG on 2,4,6 trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in rats. Forty-two male Wistar rats were divided into seven groups like Normal Control (NC), Ethanol Control (EC), Disease Control (DC), NG 20 (20 mg/kg, p.o.), NG 40 (40 mg/kg, p.o.), NG 80 (80 mg/kg, p.o.), and Dexamethasone (DEX) (2 mg/kg, p.o.). Colitis was induced in Wistar albino rats by administering TNBS intra-rectally (in 50% ethanol). The rats were then given 14 days of NG (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg) and DEX (2 mg/kg) treatment. Several behavioral, biochemical, molecular, and histological analyses were performed.Result: The treatment of rats with NG significantly increased the body weight (p < .05, p < .01), hematological parameters like hemoglobin (p < .05, p < .01, p < .001), red blood cells (p < .01, p < .001), and platelets count (p < .01, p < .001) and decreased in spleen weight (p < .01, p < .001), colon weight (p < .01, p < .001), colon weight to length ratio (p < .05, p < .01, p < .001), macroscopic score (p < .01, p < .001), adhesion score (p < .01, p < .001), diarrhea score (p < .05, p < .001), stool consistency (p < .01, p < .001), rectal bleeding score (p < .05, p < .01, p < .001), white blood cells count (p < .01, p < .001). NG significantly (p < .01, p < .001) increased colonic superoxide, glutathione, and catalase levels and decreased malondialdehyde and myeloperoxidase levels. It also significantly (p < .01, p < .001) decreased the biochemical parameters, proinflammatory cytokines and reduced the histological damage in the colon tissue caused by TNBS.Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that NG treatment attenuated pathologic changes of TNBS-induced colitis in rats through restoring colonic damage and reducing inflammatory response in the colon tissue. Thus, NG might be considered as an effective candidate for the treatment of UC patients.

  Title: Protective effect of naringin ameliorates TNBS-induced colitis in rats via improving antioxidant status and pro-inflammatory cytokines.
  Abstract: Aim: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that disturbs the colon mucosal lining and is characterized by oxido-nitrosative stress and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Naringin (NG) belongs to a group of chemicals called bioflavonoids derived from grapefruit and related citrus species. NG has been widely used as folk medicine in many countries, due to its several health benefits.Method: This study examined the effect of NG on 2,4,6 trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in rats. Forty-two male Wistar rats were divided into seven groups like Normal Control (NC), Ethanol Control (EC), Disease Control (DC), NG 20 (20 mg/kg, p.o.), NG 40 (40 mg/kg, p.o.), NG 80 (80 mg/kg, p.o.), and Dexamethasone (DEX) (2 mg/kg, p.o.). Colitis was induced in Wistar albino rats by administering TNBS intra-rectally (in 50% ethanol). The rats were then given 14 days of NG (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg) and DEX (2 mg/kg) treatment. Several behavioral, biochemical, molecular, and histological analyses were performed.Result: The treatment of rats with NG significantly increased the body weight (p < .05, p < .01), hematological parameters like hemoglobin (p < .05, p < .01, p < .001), red blood cells (p < .01, p < .001), and platelets count (p < .01, p < .001) and decreased in spleen weight (p < .01, p < .001), colon weight (p < .01, p < .001), colon weight to length ratio (p < .05, p < .01, p < .001), macroscopic score (p < .01, p < .001), adhesion score (p < .01, p < .001), diarrhea score (p < .05, p < .001), stool consistency (p < .01, p < .001), rectal bleeding score (p < .05, p < .01, p < .001), white blood cells count (p < .01, p < .001). NG significantly (p < .01, p < .001) increased colonic superoxide, glutathione, and catalase levels and decreased malondialdehyde and myeloperoxidase levels. It also significantly (p < .01, p < .001) decreased the biochemical parameters, proinflammatory cytokines and reduced the histological damage in the colon tissue caused by TNBS.Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that NG treatment attenuated pathologic changes of TNBS-induced colitis in rats through restoring colonic damage and reducing inflammatory response in the colon tissue. Thus, NG might be considered as an effective candidate for the treatment of UC patients.

  Title: Curcumin regulates the homeostasis of Th17/Treg and improves the composition of gut microbiota in type 2 diabetic mice with colitis.
  Abstract: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common complications in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Curcumin has a wide range of bioactive and pharmacological properties and is commonly used as an adjunct to the treatment of UC and DM. However, the role of curcumin in UC complicated by DM has not been elucidated. Therefore, this study was conducted to construct a model of UC complicating diabetes by inducing UC in DB mice (spontaneously diabetic) with dextran sodium sulfate. In this study, curcumin (100 mg/kg/day) significantly improved the symptoms of diabetes complicated by UC, with a lower insulin level, heavier weight, longer and lighter colons, fewer mucosal ulcers and less inflammatory cell infiltration. Moreover, compared to untreated DB mice with colitis, curcumin-treated mice showed weaker Th17 responses and stronger Treg responses. In addition, curcumin regulated the diversity and relative abundance of intestinal microbiota in mice with UC complicated by DM at the phylum, class, order, family and genus levels. Collectively, curcumin effectively alleviated colitis in mice with type 2 diabetes mellitus by restoring the homeostasis of Th17/Treg and improving the composition of the intestinal microbiota.© 2022 The Authors.

  Title: Anti-inflammatory effect of Rhein on ulcerative colitis via inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and regulating gut microbiota.
  Abstract: This study aimed to analyze the therapeutic effect of Rhein on ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice and its possible mechanism. LPS-induced UC cell model and DSS-induced UC mouse model were used to analyze the antiinflammatory effect of Rhein on UC in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Network pharmacology analysis was conducted to identify potential signaling pathways involved in Rhein treating UC, and the results were further confirmed through western blotting assay. 16sRNA sequencing was performed to study the regulatory effect of Rhein on gut microbiota in UC mice. As indicated by the results, Rhein could significantly inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β) in vivo and in vitro, and alleviate DSS-induced UC-associated symptoms in mice (e.g., colon shortening, weight loss, diarrhea and hematochezia). The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway was predicted as the potential interacting protein of Rhein in the treatment of UC through network pharmacology analysis. It was found through western blotting assay that the Rhein treatment could significantly inhibit the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway by decreasing the phosphorylated protein levels of PI3K, Akt, mTOR and p70S6K1. By 16sRNA gene sequencing analysis, Rhein administration could partially reverse the gut dysbacteriosis of mice induced by DSS and decrease pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Enterobacteriaceae and Turicibacter). It was positively correlated with the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines above, whereas the increase in probiotics (e.g., Unspecified-S24-7 and Rikenellaceae) was negatively correlated with the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, Rhine had anti-UC efficacy, which was demonstrated by mitigating the UC symptoms and reducing intestinal inflammation by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and modulating gut microbiota.© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

  Title: Subcutaneous injection of infliximab CT-P13 results in stable drug levels within 14-day treatment cycle in Crohn's disease.
  Abstract: The new subcutaneous (sc) formulation of the infliximab (IFX) biosimilar CT-P13 results in homogeneous serum trough concentrations of IFX at steady state. The present study aimed to investigate in Crohn's disease (CD) patients the intra-individual variations of IFX drug levels at multiple time-points during 2 consecutive cycles of maintenance therapy with CT-P13 sc.CD patients in clinico-biological remission under maintenance therapy with intravenous (iv) IFX/CT-P13 were switched to CT-P13 sc 8 weeks (W) after the last infusion. They were treated with CT-P13 sc, 120 mg every 2 W. Assessments were performed from 8 W after starting CT-P13 sc and patients had to attend 6 visits on 2 consecutive cycles of treatment (cycles A and B). Visits were scheduled on days 4-6 (visit 1), days 7-9 (visit 2) and day 14 (visit 3) of each cycle, where days 1 and 14 were the days of sc injection of CT-P13. At each visit, peripheral blood was collected to measure serum IFX levels and anti-drug antibodies.Twenty patients underwent 120 evaluations. Large intra-individual variations of serum drug levels of IFX were observed. When pooling the 120 evaluations, the mean drug level was 11.3 ± 4.9 μg/ml, and the median drug level was 10.9 μg/ml (IQR 7.5-15.5). During each cycle, the median drug levels were similar between visits 1 and 2 as well as between visits 1 and 3 and between visits 2 and 3. In cycle A, median drug levels were 11.1 μg/ml (7.8-14.5), 12.0 μg/ml (7.2-16.1) and 11.0 μg/ml (7.5-15.1) at V1, V2 and V3, respectively. Similar results were obtained in cycle B, where median drug levels were 11.6 μg/ml (7.9-14.9), 11.4 μg/ml (8.1-15.2) and 10.9 μg/ml (7.9-15.6) at V1, V2 and V3, respectively. In univariate analysis, we failed to identify factors predictive of low drug levels.IFX drug levels are quite stable within 14-day treatment cycle, without trough levels in CD patients in remission during the maintenance therapy with CT-P13 sc. In patients with inactive CD under maintenance therapy with CT-P13 sc, therapeutic drug monitoring of IFX can be performed at any time between two CT-P13 sc injections.© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

  Title: Phosphodiesters as GPR84 Antagonists for the Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis.
  Abstract: GPR84 is a proinflammatory G protein-coupled receptor associated with several inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. GPR84 antagonists have been evaluated in clinical trials to treat ulcerative colitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. However, the variety of potent and selective GPR84 antagonists is still limited. Through high-throughput screening, a novel phosphodiester compound hit 1 was identified as a GPR84 antagonist. The subsequent structural optimization led to the identification of compound 33 with improved potency in the calcium mobilization assay and the ability to inhibit the chemotaxis of neutrophils and macrophages upon GPR84 activation. In a DSS-induced mouse model of ulcerative colitis, compound 33 significantly alleviated colitis symptoms and reduced the disease activity index score at oral doses of 25 mg/kg qd, with an efficacy similar to that of positive control 5-aminosalicylic acid (200 mg/kg, qd, po), suggesting that compound 33 is a promising candidate for further drug development.

  Title: Anti-inflammatory and Immunomodulatory Potency of Selenium-Enriched Probiotic Mutants in Mice with Induced Ulcerative Colitis.
  Abstract: Selenium-enriched Lactobacillus plantarum and Bifidobacterium longum mutants were used as a protector against Piroxicam-induced ulcerative colitis (UC). In this study, 32 BALB/c male mice were distributed to four groups: the control group, the Piroxicam group which was given 0.8 mg Piroxicam, SP and SB groups which were given 0.8 mg Piroxicam, and plus Lactobacillus plantarum and Bifidobacterium longum selenium-enriched mutants, respectively. Bodyweight; serum content of IgG, IgM, TNF-α, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10; CBC; myeloperoxidase enzyme activity; histopathological examination of colon and spleen; and expression of TNF-α, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10 genes in colon and spleen with qRT-PCR were determined. Bodyweight was found to reduce in the Piroxicam group and then recovery in the SB group. Serum content of IgG, IL-2, and IL-10 reduced in the Piroxicam group, whereas IgG, TNF-α, and IL-6 increased in the Piroxicam group in comparison to the other groups. Myeloperoxidase activity witnessed a significant increase in the Piroxicam group compared with the other groups. No significant differences were observed between all groups in measurements of red cells, hemoglobin, neutrophil, monocyte, eosinophil, and basophil in blood. Meanwhile, the white blood cells and platelets recorded the highest and lowest value, respectively, in the Piroxicam group. The colon of the Piroxicam group showed a noticeably massive infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lamina propria. These inflammations were mildly reduced in the SP group, while the reduction in the SB group was significant. In the Piroxicam group, splenic parenchyma saw an increase in the number of melanomacrophages, while hypertrophic plasma cells were observed in the SP group. The spleen of the SB group exhibits a nearly normal form. TNF-α and IL-6 genes had significantly upregulated in the colon of the Piroxicam group compared to the control group, while they were significantly downregulated in the SB group. In contrast, IL-2 and IL-10 genes had upregulated in the colon of the SB group compared to the control groups, while they had downregulated in the Piroxicam group. The expression of these genes had not recorded significant differences between all groups in the spleen. Therefore, this study recommends Bifidobacterium longum selenium-enriched mutants as anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory supplements.© 2022. The Author(s).

In the Piroxicam group, splenic parenchyma saw an increase in the number of melanomacrophages, while hypertrophic plasma cells were observed in the SP group. The spleen of the SB group exhibits a nearly normal form. TNF-α and IL-6 genes had significantly upregulated in the colon of the Piroxicam group compared to the control group, while they were significantly downregulated in the SB group. In contrast, IL-2 and IL-10 genes had upregulated in the colon of the SB group compared to the control groups, while they had downregulated in the Piroxicam group. The expression of these genes had not recorded significant differences between all groups in the spleen. Therefore, this study recommends Bifidobacterium longum selenium-enriched mutants as anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory supplements.© 2022. The Author(s).

  Title: Glucosylceramide in T cells regulates the pathology of inflammatory bowel disease.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease in the colon characterized by excessive activation of T cells. Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) are composed of lipid rafts in cellular membranes, and their content is linked to immune cell function. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of GSLs in IBD. Microarray data showed that in IBD patients, the expression of only UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase (UGCG) decreased among the GSLs synthases. Ad libitum access to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) resulted in decreased UGCG and glucosylceramide (GlcCer) content in mesenteric lymph nodes and T cells from the spleen. Furthermore, the knockdown of Ugcg in T cells exacerbated the pathogenesis of colitis, which was accompanied by a decrease in Treg levels. Treatment with GlcCer nanoparticles prevented DSS-induced colitis. These results suggested that GlcCer in T cells is involved in the pathogenesis of IBD. Furthermore, GlcCer nanoparticles are a potential efficacious therapeutic target for IBD patients.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

  Title: Identification of Corosolic and Oleanolic Acids as Molecules Antagonizing the Human RORγT Nuclear Receptor Using the Calculated Fingerprints of the Molecular Similarity.
  Abstract: RORγT is a protein product of the RORC gene belonging to the nuclear receptor subfamily of retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptors (RORs). RORγT is preferentially expressed in Th17 lymphocytes and drives their differentiation from naive CD4+ cells and is involved in the regulation of the expression of numerous Th17-specific cytokines, such as IL-17. Because Th17 cells are implicated in the pathology of autoimmune diseases (e.g., psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis), RORγT, whose activity is regulated by ligands, has been recognized as a drug target in potential therapies against these diseases. The identification of such ligands is time-consuming and usually requires the screening of chemical libraries. Herein, using a Tanimoto similarity search, we found corosolic acid and other pentacyclic tritepenes in the library we previously screened as compounds highly similar to the RORγT inverse agonist ursolic acid. Furthermore, using gene reporter assays and Th17 lymphocytes, we distinguished compounds that exert stronger biological effects (ursolic, corosolic, and oleanolic acid) from those that are ineffective (asiatic and maslinic acids), providing evidence that such combinatorial methodology (in silico and experimental) might help wet screenings to achieve more accurate results, eliminating false negatives.

  Title: The Ketogenic Diet Improves Gut-Brain Axis in a Rat Model of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Impact on 5-HT and BDNF Systems.
  Abstract: Altered gut-brain communication can contribute to intestinal dysfunctions in the intestinal bowel syndrome. The neuroprotective high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD) modulates the levels of different neurotransmitters and neurotrophins. The aim was to evaluate the effects of KD on levels of 5-HT, the receptors 5-HT3B and 5-HT4, the 5-HT transporter SERT, the neurotrophin BDNF, and its receptor TrkB in the colon and brain of a rat model of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Samples from Wistar rats exposed to maternal deprivation as newborns and then fed with a standard diet (IBS-Std) or KD (IBS-KD) for ten weeks were analyzed. As controls, unexposed rats (Ctrl-Std and Ctrl-KD) were studied. IBS-Std rats had a disordered enteric serotoninergic signaling shown by increased mucosal 5-HT content and reduced SERT, 5-HT3B, and 5-HT4 levels compared to controls. In the brain, these animals showed up-regulation of the BDNF receptor TrkB as a counteracting response to the stress-induced reduction of the neurotrophin. KD showed a dual effect in improving the altered 5-HT and BDNF systems. It down-regulated the increased mucosal 5-HT without affecting transporter and receptor levels. KD improved brain BDNF levels and established negative feedback, leading to a compensatory downregulation of TrkB to maintain a physiological steady state.

  Title: Berberine suppresses cecal ligation and puncture induced intestinal injury by enhancing Treg cell function.
  Abstract: The gut is hypothesized to be the "motor" of critical illness and plays an important role in the development of sepsis. Berberine (BBR) is an alkaloid compound extracted from herbs, which has anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative effects and can be used in intestinal infectious diseases and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). BBR could promote differentiation of Treg cells which play a key role in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis. However, its effect on sepsis-induced intestinal injury remains poorly understood. This study investigated the effect of BBR on cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced intestinal injury and explained the underlying mechanism. These results showed that BBR treatment decreased the mortality of septic mice, alleviated intestinal injury and reduced serum endotoxin level; at the same time, BBR had a protective effect on CLP-induced lung and liver apoptosis. Meanwhile, BBR treatment increased the proportion of Treg cells and CTLA-4 in Treg cells. Treg cells from BBR treatment mice could decrease the pro-inflammatory response by inhibiting the activation of macrophages, thus exerting a protective effect on CLP-induced intestinal injury, and CTLA-4 mediated cell-cell contact pathway is required for this protective effect.Copyright © 2022.

  Title: Misdiagnosis of sphincter of Oddi disorder treated as familial Mediterranean fever for ten years: A case report.
  Abstract: Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction is a rare disease caused by sphincter of Oddi functional or mechanical abnormality. Misdiagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever is very high due to overlapping symptoms with many diseases. Our case is the first case report in the medical literature which describes the misdiagnosis of Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction as familial Mediterranean fever.A 46-year-old woman presented with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain and arthralgia. The patient had familial Mediterranean fever for ten years which was diagnosed clinically without performing genetic tests. Analysis of the mutation in the MEFV gene was performed and was negative. Thereby, the diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever was eliminated and colchisine was discontinued. Afterward, laboratory and radiological tests were performed, and the diagnosis of sphincter of Oddi disfunction was confirmed. The patient underwent biliary sphincterotomy and take sulpiride daily.The most common diseases were misdiagnosed with familial Mediterranean fever are appendicitis, acute rheumatic fever, gastrointestinal diseases and inflammatory arthritis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with Manometry of the Sphincter of Oddi is the gold-standard test.Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction may interfere with many other disorders and should be considered as a differential diagnosis for any recurrent abdominal pain. Misdiagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever is common in endemic countries due to the reliance on clinical symptoms without analysis of the mutations in the MEFV genes particularly, before 1997.© 2022 The Authors.

  Title: Ethanolic extract from Lepidium virginicum L. ameliorates DNBS-induced colitis in rats.
  Abstract: Lepidium virginicum L. (Brassicaceae) is a plant widely used in traditional Mexican medicine as an expectorant, diuretic, and as a remedy to treat diarrhea and dysentery, infection-derived gastroenteritis. However, there is no scientific study that validates its clinical use as an anti-inflammatory in the intestine.This study aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory properties of the ethanolic extract of Lepidium virginicum L. (ELv) in an animal model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-like colitis.The 2,4-dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS) animal model of IBD was used. Colitis was induced by intrarectal instillation of 200 mg/kg of DNBS dissolved vehicle, 50% ethanol. Control rats only received the vehicle. Six hours posterior to DNBS administration, ELv (3, 30, or 100 mg/kg) was administered daily by gavage or intraperitoneal injection. The onset and course of the inflammatory response were monitored by assessing weight loss, stool consistency, and fecal blood. Colonic damage was evaluated by colon weight/length ratio, histopathology, colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 1 (CXCL-1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6).Rats treated with DNBS displayed significant weight loss, diarrhea, fecal blood, colon shortening, a significant increase in immune cell infiltration and MPO activity, as well as increased proinflammatory cytokine expression. Intraperitoneal administration of ELv significantly reduced colon inflammation, whereas oral treatment proved to be ineffective. In fact, intraperitoneal ELv significantly attenuated the clinical manifestations of colitis, immune cell infiltration, MPO activity, and pro-inflammatory (CXCL-1, TNF-α, and IL-1β) gene expression in a dose-dependent manner.Traditional medicine has employed ELv as a remedy for common infection-derived gastrointestinal symptoms; however, we hereby present the first published study validating its anti-inflammatory properties in the mitigation of DNBS-induced colitis.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

In fact, intraperitoneal ELv significantly attenuated the clinical manifestations of colitis, immune cell infiltration, MPO activity, and pro-inflammatory (CXCL-1, TNF-α, and IL-1β) gene expression in a dose-dependent manner.Traditional medicine has employed ELv as a remedy for common infection-derived gastrointestinal symptoms; however, we hereby present the first published study validating its anti-inflammatory properties in the mitigation of DNBS-induced colitis.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

  Title: Natural Herbal Remedy Wumei Decoction Ameliorates Intestinal Mucosal Inflammation by Inhibiting Th1/Th17 Cell Differentiation and Maintaining Microbial Homeostasis.
  Abstract: Evidence has shown that the traditional Chinese herbal medicine Wumei decoction (WMD) has a protective effect on ulcerative colitis. Here, we studied the anti-inflammatory effects and potential mechanisms of WMD on chronic colitis in mice.A dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced chronic colitis model and CD45RBhighCD4+ T cell transfer model were established in mice. Body weight, Disease Activity Index, and colon length were assessed, and histopathology was confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Colon tissue samples were collected to detect the frequencies of various immune cells, expression of cytokines, and tight junction-related proteins using flow cytometry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing was performed to distinguish differential microbiota of fecal samples.Severe chronic colitis was observed in mice after DSS exposure and in Rag1-/- mice reconstituted with CD45RBhighCD4+ T cells, as manifested by weight loss, hematochezia, and shortening and thickening of the colon, which were reversed by WMD treatment. WMD markedly suppressed intestinal mucosal CD4+ T cell differentiation and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin-1β, interferon γ, and IL-17A) by flow cytometry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Moreover, WMD promoted the expression of occludin, zonula occludens-1, and E-cadherin, thereby maintaining the epithelial barrier function. Additionally, 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing revealed that WMD regulated the dysbiosis of gut microbiota in CD45RBhighCD4+ T cell-reconstituted Rag1-/- mice, evidenced by an increase of Allobaculum and Bacteroides and a decrease of Ileibacterium.WMD ameliorates chronic colitis in mice induced by DSS or reconstituted with CD45RBhighCD4+ T cells through suppressing Th1/Th17 cell differentiation and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, maintaining epithelial barrier function, and improving the dysbiosis.© The Author(s) 2022.

  Title: Transcriptional regulation of chemokine network by biologic monotherapy in ileum of patients with Crohn's disease.
  Abstract: Crohn's disease (CD) exacerbation is marked by an intense cellular trafficking. We set out to determine the specific impact of biologic therapies on regulating chemokine network gene expression in healthy, mildly and severely inflamed tissue of CD patients.Twenty CD patients on biologics (adalimumab, ustekinumab, vedolizumab) or untreated undergoing colonoscopy due to clinical symptoms of flare. Healthy, mildly and severely inflamed ileum biopsies from each patient were collected. Chemokines and receptors gene expression was analyzed and a STRING analysis for functional enrichment was performed.The chemokine network exhibited wide transcriptional differences among tissues in active untreated patients, whereas all biologic treatments reduced these differences and homogenized their transcriptional activity. In mildly inflamed tissue, all treatments showed gene upregulation while ustekinumab additionally maintained the downregulation of genes such as CCL2, CCL3, CCL17 or CCL23, involved in T cell chemotaxis, inflammatory monocyte and NK trafficking. In severely inflamed tissue, all treatments shared a downregulatory effect on chemokines controlling T cell response (i.e. CXCL16, CXCR3). Adalimumab and vedolizumab significantly reduced the expression of genes promoting antigen presentation by DCs and the initiation of leukocyte extravasation (i.e. CXCL12, CCL25, CCR7). Ustekinumab significantly reduced genes positively regulating Th1 cytokine production and IL-8 mediated signaling (i.e. IL1B, XCL1, CXCR1, CXCR2).Biologic therapies differentially target the chemokine network gene expression profile in the ileal tissue of active CD patients. These results may contribute to better understanding cell homing and to defining future personalized therapeutic strategies for CD patients.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

  Title: High oncostatin M predicts lack of clinical remission for patients with inflammatory bowel disease on tumor necrosis factor α antagonists.
  Abstract: The interleukin-6 family cytokine, oncostatin-M (OSM) has been associated with response to tumor necrosis factor-α antagonists (anti-TNFs) in small cohorts of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to evaluate the association between plasma OSM concentrations and response to anti-TNFs (infliximab and adalimumab) in both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). A retrospective cohort study was conducted in patients with IBD with a history of anti-TNF exposure. Blood samples, collected prior to anti-TNF exposure, were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the presence and quantity of OSM. Clinical remission was assessed at 1-year post anti-TNF exposure in addition to the occurrence of surgery, hospitalization, corticosteroid use, and adverse drug events. Lastly the threshold OSM plasma concentration associated with anti-TNF non-response was assessed by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Patients with IBD (CD, n = 82; UC, n = 40) were assessed. In both UC and CD, mean pre-treatment OSM concentrations were significantly lower in those who achieved clinical remission at 1-year (p < 0.0001). A threshold plasma OSM concentration of 168.7 pg/ml and 233.6 pg/ml respectively separated those who achieved clinical remission at 1-year on an anti-TNF from those who did not in CD and UC respectively (CD: area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, AUROC = 0.880, 95% CI 0.79-0.96; UC: AUROC = 0.938, 95% CI 0.87-1.00). High OSM concentrations were associated with anti-TNF discontinuation and use of rescue steroids in CD and UC. High pre-treatment OSM concentrations identify IBD patients at-risk of anti-TNF non-response at 1-year as well as other deleterious clinical outcomes.© 2022. The Author(s).

  Title: Role of Vitamin K in Intestinal Health.
  Abstract: Intestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and colorectal cancer (CRC) generally characterized by clinical symptoms, including malabsorption, intestinal dysfunction, injury, and microbiome imbalance, as well as certain secondary intestinal disease complications, continue to be serious public health problems worldwide. The role of vitamin K (VK) on intestinal health has drawn growing interest in recent years. In addition to its role in blood coagulation and bone health, several investigations continue to explore the role of VK as an emerging novel biological compound with the potential function of improving intestinal health. This study aims to present a thorough review on the bacterial sources, intestinal absorption, uptake of VK, and VK deficiency in patients with intestinal diseases, with emphasis on the effect of VK supplementation on immunity, anti-inflammation, intestinal microbes and its metabolites, antioxidation, and coagulation, and promoting epithelial development. Besides, VK-dependent proteins (VKDPs) are another crucial mechanism for VK to exert a gastroprotection role for their functions of anti-inflammation, immunomodulation, and anti-tumorigenesis. In summary, published studies preliminarily show that VK presents a beneficial effect on intestinal health and may be used as a therapeutic drug to prevent/treat intestinal diseases, but the specific mechanism of VK in intestinal health has yet to be elucidated.Copyright © 2022 Lai, Masatoshi, Ma, Guo and Zhang.

  Title: ROS-Sensitive Polymer Micelles for Selective Degradation in Primary Human Monocytes from Patients with Active IBD.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in inflamed areas of the gastrointestinal tract and in circulating immune cells, providing novel opportunities for targeted drug delivery. In the recent experiments, oxidation-responsive polymeric nanostructures selectively degrade in the presence of H2 O2 . Based on these results, it is hypothesized that such degradation process can be triggered in a similar way by the incubation with stimulated monocytes isolated from patients with IBD. A first indication is given by a significant correlation between excessive ROS and degradation of micelles in monocytes isolated from healthy individuals after phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation. But even if the ROS-sensitive micelles are incubated with nonstimulated monocytes from patients with active IBD, a spontaneous degradation is observed in contrast to micelles incubated with monocytes from healthy donors. The findings indicate that the thioether-based micelles are indeed promising for selective drug release in the presence of activated immune cells.© 2022 The Authors.

  Title: Metformin ameliorates chronic colitis in a mouse model by regulating interferon-γ-producing lamina propria CD4+ T cells through AMPK activation.
  Abstract: Metformin, a commonly prescribed drug for type 2 diabetes mellitus, has been shown to activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Notably, AMPK activation has recently been observed to be associated with anti-inflammatory responses. Metformin is also reported to elicit anti-inflammatory responses in CD4+ T cells, resulting in improvement in experimental chronic inflammatory diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. To investigate the effect of metformin on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we developed a T cell-transfer model of chronic colitis in which SCID mice were injected with CD4+ CD45RBhigh T cells to induce colitis. We examined the effects of metformin via in vitro and in vivo experiments on lamina propria (LP) CD4+ T cells. We observed that metformin suppresses the frequency of interferon (IFN) -γ-producing LP CD4+ T cells in vitro, which were regulated by AMPK activation, a process possibly induced by the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, we examined the effects of metformin on an in vivo IBD model. Metformin-treated mice showed AMPK activation in LP CD4+ T cells and ameliorated colitis. Our study demonstrates that metformin-induced AMPK activation in mucosal CD4+ T cells contributes to the improvement of IBD by suppressing IFN-γ production. Moreover, our results indicate that AMPK may be a target molecule for the regulation of mucosal immunity and inflammation. Thus, AMPK-activating drugs such as metformin may be potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of IBD.© 2022 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.

  Title: Analyzing the Role of Gut Microbiota on the Onset of Autoimmune Diseases Using TNFΔARE Murine Model.
  Abstract: Very little is known about disease transmission via the gut microbiome. We hypothesized that certain inflammatory features could be transmitted via the gut microbiome and tested this hypothesis using an animal model of inflammatory diseases. Twelve-week-old healthy C57 Bl/6 and Germ-Free (GF) female and male mice were fecal matter transplanted (FMT) under anaerobic conditions with TNFΔARE-/+ donors exhibiting spontaneous Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) or with conventional healthy mice control donors. The gut microbiome analysis was performed using 16S rRNA sequencing amplification and bioinformatics analysis with the HIVE bioinformatics platform. Histology, immunohistochemistry, ELISA Multiplex analysis, and flow cytometry were conducted to confirm the inflammatory transmission status. We observed RA and IBD features transmitted in the GF mice cohort, with gut tissue disruption, cartilage alteration, elevated inflammatory mediators in the tissues, activation of CD4/CD8+ T cells, and colonization and transmission of the gut microbiome similar to the donors' profile. We did not observe a change or transmission when conventional healthy mice were FMT with TNFΔARE-/+ donors, suggesting that a healthy microbiome might withstand an unhealthy transplant. These findings show the potential involvement of the gut microbiome in inflammatory diseases. We identified a cluster of bacteria playing a role in this mechanism.

  Title: Role of Serum Proteinase 3 Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies in the Diagnosis, Evaluation of Disease Severity, and Clinical Course of Ulcerative Colitis.
  Abstract: Proteinase 3 antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (PR3-ANCA) is a serologic marker for granulomatosis with polyangiitis. However, recent studies have also shown their role as diagnostic markers for ulcerative colitis (UC). This study was performed to investigate the clinical roles of PR3-ANCAs in the disease severity, disease extension, and clinical course of UC.Serum PR3-ANCAs were measured in 173 UC patients including 77 patients with new-onset patients UC diagnosed within 1 month, 110 patients with Crohn's disease, 48 patients with other intestinal diseases, and 71 healthy controls. Associations between the PR3-ANCA titer and clinical data, such as disease severity, disease extension, and clinical course, were assessed. The clinical utility of PR3-ANCA measurement was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.PR3-ANCA ≥3.5 U/mL demonstrated 44.5% sensitivity and 95.6% specificity for the diagnosis of UC in all patients. PR3-ANCA positivity was more prevalent in the 77 new-onset UC patients (58.4%). In this group, the disease severity and extension were more severe in PR3-ANCA positive patients than in PR3-ANCA negative group (p<0.001). After treatment, the partial Mayo scores were significantly decreased with the PR3-ANCA titers. The proportion of patients who required steroids for induction therapy was significantly higher among PR3-ANCA positive than negative group. ROC analysis revealed that PR3-ANCA ≥3.5 U/mL had 75% sensitivity and 69.0% specificity for steroid requirement in new-onset UC patients.Our results indicate that PR3-ANCA measurement is useful not only for diagnosing UC but also for evaluating disease severity and extension and predicting the clinical course.

  Title: Anti-TNF Agents Restrict Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli Replication Within Macrophages Through Modulation of Chitinase 3-like 1 in Patients with Crohn's Disease.
  Abstract: The mechanism of action of anti-tumour necrosis factor [anti-TNF] agents could implicate macrophage modulation in Crohn's disease [CD]. As CD macrophages are defective in controlling CD-associated adherent-invasive Escherichia coli [AIEC], anti-TNF agents could limit AIEC replication within macrophages. We assessed the effect of anti-TNF agents on AIEC survival within monocyte-derived macrophages [MDMs] from CD patients and attempted to identify the proteins involved.Peripheral blood MDMs were obtained from 44 CD patients [22 with and 22 without anti-TNF agents]. MDMs were infected with reference strain AIEC-LF82. Proteomic analysis was performed before and 6 h after AIEC-LF82 infection.AIEC-LF82 survival was lower in MDMs from CD patients receiving anti-TNF agents compared to those who did not [-73%, p = 0.006]. After AIEC-LF82 infection, the levels of CD82 [p = 0.007], ILF3 [Interleukin enhancer-binding factor 3; p = 0.001], FLOT-1 [Flotillin-1; p = 0.007] and CHI3L1 [Chitinase 3-like 1; p = 0.035] proteins were different within CD-MDMs depending on anti-TNF exposure. FLOT-1 [ϱ = -0.44; p = 0.038] and CHI3L1 [ϱ = 0.57, p = 0.006] levels were inversely and positively correlated with AIEC survival within MDMs from CD patients with or without anti-TNF, respectively. We observed a dose-dependent decrease of AIEC-LF82 survival after adjunction of anti-TNF within MDMs, inducing an increase of FLOT-1 and decrease of CHI3L1 mRNA levels. Neutralization of intra-macrophagic CHI3L1 protein using anti-CHI3L1 antibodies reduced AIEC survival within macrophages 6 h after infection [p < 0.05].Anti-TNF agents are able to restrict replication of pathobionts, such as AIEC, within macrophages by modulating FLOT-1 and CHI3L1 expression in CD patients.© The Author(s) 2022.

  Title: Bioactive fish collagen peptides weaken intestinal inflammation by orienting colonic macrophages phenotype through mannose receptor activation.
  Abstract: Particular interest is now given to the potential of dietary supplements as alternative non-pharmacological approaches in intestinal inflammation handling. In this aim, this study evaluates the efficiency of fish collagen peptides, Naticol®Gut, on colonic inflammation.Wild type and Mannose receptor-deficient in the myeloid lineage C57BL/6 mice were administered with Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS), Naticol®Gut, DSS, and Naticol®Gut or only water for 4 or 8 days. Inflammatory status was evaluated by establishing macroscopic and microscopic scores, by measuring cytokine and calprotectin production by ELISA and the myeloperoxidase activity by chemiluminescence. Colonic macrophages were phenotyped by measuring mRNA levels of specific markers of inflammation and oxidative status. Colonic immune populations and T-cell activation profiles were determined by flow cytometry. Mucosa-associated gut microbiota assessment was undertaken by qPCR. The phenotype of human blood monocytes from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) subjects was characterized by RT-qPCR and flow cytometry and their oxidative activity by chemiluminescence.Naticol®Gut-treated DSS mice showed attenuated colonic inflammation compared to mice that were only exposed to DSS. Naticol®Gut activity was displayed through its ability to orient the polarization of colonic macrophage towards an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant phenotype after its recognition by the mannose receptor. Subsequently, Naticol®Gut delivery modulated CD4 T cells in favor of a Th2 response and dampened CD8 T-cell activation. This immunomodulation resulted in an intestinal eubiosis. In human monocytes from IBD subjects, the treatment with Naticol®Gut also restored an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant phenotype.Naticol®Gut acts as a protective agent against colitis appearing as a new functional food and an innovative and complementary approach in gut health.© 2022.

  Title: Lymphoid and myeloid proliferative disorders associated with inflammatory bowel disease: a clinicopathological study of 15 cases.
  Abstract: Lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD) can occur in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). On rare occasions, patients with IBD develop myeloid neoplasms; however, the frequency and clinicopathological features of IBD-associated lymphoid and myeloid proliferative disorder (LMPD) in Japanese patients are still unclear. In this study, we reviewed 2474 Japanese patients with IBD and found that LMPD occurred in 12 (0.5%) patients with UC (n = 7) or CD (n = 5). Together with an additional 3 cases, we analyzed a total of 15 cases of LMPD for clinicopathological and histological features. Based on the status of using immunosuppressants such as biologics and immunomodulators, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, and histopathology, the 15 cases were classified into Group I (high-grade LPD; n = 7), Group II (low-grade LPD; n = 5), and Group III (myeloid neoplasms; n = 3). Most patients in Group I were undergoing strong immunosuppressive therapy, and the LPD lesions corresponded to high-grade B-cell or T cell/natural killer cell lymphoma often with EBV infection. Discontinuation of immunosuppressive drugs alone did not resolve these LPDs; Group I patients required chemotherapy, and eventually 4 of them (57%) died of the tumor. Most cases in Group II were low-grade B-cell lymphoma without EBV infection and had an indolent clinical course with excellent prognosis. All patients in Group III developed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) during the course of CD. Two (67%) of these patients died of AML. Our study suggests that IBD-associated LMPD is very rare but can follow an aggressive clinical course.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

  Title: Discovery of Orally Available Retinoic Acid Receptor-Related Orphan Receptor γ-t/Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase Dual Inhibitors for the Treatment of Refractory Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease, representing a major clinical challenge. Herein, a strategy of dual-targeting approach employing retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor γ-t (RORγt) and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) was proposed for the treatment of IBD. Dual RORγt/DHODH inhibitors are expected not only to reduce RORγt-driven Th17 cell differentiation but also to mitigate the expansion and activation of T cells, which may enhance anti-inflammatory effects. Starting from 2-aminobenzothiazole hit 1, a series of 2-aminotetrahydrobenzothiazoles were discovered as potent dual RORγt/DHODH inhibitors. Compound 14d stands out with IC50 values of 0.110 μM for RORγt and of 0.297 μM for DHODH. With acceptable mouse pharmacokinetic profiles, 14d exhibited remarkable in vivo anti-inflammatory activity and dose-dependently alleviated the severity of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced acute colitis in mice. Taken together, the present study provides a novel framework for the development of therapeutic agents for the treatment of IBD.

  Title: Prebiotics, Probiotics, Synbiotics, Paraprobiotics and Postbiotic Compounds in IBD.
  Abstract: The increasing incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and the increasing severity of the course of these diseases create the need for developing new methods of therapy. The gut microbiome is extensively studied as a factor influencing the development and course of IBD. The composition of intestinal microbiota can be relatively easily modified by diet (i.e., prebiotics, mainly dietary fibers) and bacterial supplementation using beneficial bacteria strains called probiotics. Additionally, the effects of the improved microbiome could be enhanced or gained by using paraprobiotics (non-viable, inactivated bacteria or their components) and/or postbiotics (products of bacterial metabolism or equal synthetic products that beneficially modulate immunological response and inflammation). This study summarizes the recent works on prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics (products merging pre- and probiotics), paraprobiotics and postbiotics in IBD.

  Title: Management of inflammatory bowel disease and serum level of infliximab in newborn exposed to anti-TNF therapy during pregnancy: Case report and literature review.
  Abstract: Heightened inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) activity during pregnancy is associated with higher rates of preterm birth, miscarriage, and low birth weight. Therefore, its adequate treatment is essential, considering the risk-benefit of medication use. Although previous literature has described the management of IBD during pregnancy, few studies have assessed the pharmacokinetics of IBD drugs in the newborn. In this case report, we describe the management of ulcerative colitis during pregnancy and discuss the benefits of checking serum levels of infliximab in newborns exposed to the medication during pregnancy.A 37-year-old patient with ulcerative colitis in clinical and endoscopic remission had been undergoing treated with infliximab since 2008. The patient became pregnant in 2018.Infliximab medication was discontinued at the 29th week of pregnancy.The pregnancy was uneventful, and the levels of infliximab in the umbilical cord were >20 μg/dL. Live vaccinations were postponed until the baby was 6 months old, when a new serum drug level proved to be undetectable.Our case suggests that the use of infliximab is safe in pregnancy, and drug discontinuation could be considered from the 24th week of pregnancy onward to reduce placental transfer to the newborn in patients at low risk of relapse. Vaccines with live attenuated organisms should be delayed for at least 6 months or until the serum level of the medication is undetectable.Copyright © 2021 the Author(s).

  Title: Curcumin Inhibits T Follicular Helper Cell Differentiation in Mice with Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS)-Induced Colitis.
  Abstract: Follicular helper T cells (Tfh) regulate the differentiation of germinal center B cells and maintain humoral immunity. Notably, imbalances in Tfh differentiation often lead to the development of autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Curcumin, a natural product derived from Curcuma longa, is effective in relieving IBD in humans and animals, and its mechanisms of immune regulation need further elaboration. In this study, dextran sodium sulfate induced ulcerative colitis in BALB/c mice, and curcumin was administered simultaneously for 7 days. Curcumin effectively upregulated the change rate of mouse weight, colonic length, down-regulated colonic weight, index of colonic weight, colonic damage score and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-12, IL-23 and TGF-[Formula: see text]1 in colonic tissues of colitis mice. Importantly, curcumin regulated the differentiation balance of Tfh and their subpopulation in colitis mice; the percentages of Tfh (CD4[Formula: see text]CXCR5[Formula: see text]BCL-6[Formula: see text], CD4[Formula: see text]CXCR5[Formula: see text]PD-1[Formula: see text], CD4[Formula: see text]CXCR5[Formula: see text]PD-L1[Formula: see text], CD4[Formula: see text]CXCR5[Formula: see text]ICOS[Formula: see text], Tfh17 and Tem-Tfh were downregulated significantly, while CD4[Formula: see text]CXCR5[Formula: see text]Blimp-1[Formula: see text], Tfh1, Tfh10, Tfh21, Tfr, Tcm-Tfh and Tem-GC Tfh were upregulated. In addition, curcumin inhibited the expression of Tfh-related transcription factors BCL-6, p-STAT3, Foxp1, Roquin-1, Roquin-2 and SAP, and significantly upregulated the protein levels of Blimp-1 and STAT3 in colon tissue. In conclusion, curcumin may be effective in alleviating dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis by regulating Tfh differentiation.

  Title: Hyperactive neutrophil chemotaxis contributes to anti-tumor necrosis factor-α treatment resistance in inflammatory bowel disease.
  Abstract: Anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF-α) agents have been used for inflammatory bowel disease; however, it has up to 30% nonresponse rate. Identifying molecular pathways and finding reliable diagnostic biomarkers for patient response to anti-TNF-α treatment are needed.Publicly available transcriptomic data from inflammatory bowel disease patients receiving anti-TNF-α therapy were systemically collected and integrated. In silico flow cytometry approaches and Metascape were applied to evaluate immune cell populations and to perform gene enrichment analysis, respectively. Genes identified within enrichment pathways validated in neutrophils were tracked in an anti-TNF-α-treated animal model (with lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation). The receiver operating characteristic curve was applied to all genes to identify the best prediction biomarkers.A total of 449 samples were retrieved from control, baseline, and after primary anti-TNF-α therapy or placebo. No statistically significant differences were observed between anti-TNF-α treatment responders and nonresponders at baseline in immune microenvironment scores. Neutrophil, endothelial cell, and B-cell populations were higher in baseline nonresponders, and chemotaxis pathways may contribute to the treatment resistance. Genes related to chemotaxis pathways were significantly upregulated in lipopolysaccharide-induced neutrophils, but no statistically significant changes were observed in neutrophils treated with anti-TNF-α. Interleukin 13 receptor subunit alpha 2 (IL13RA2) is the best predictor (receiver operating characteristic curve: 80.7%, 95% confidence interval: 73.8-87.5%), with a sensitivity of 68.13% and specificity of 84.93%, and significantly higher in nonresponders compared with responders (P < 0.0001).Hyperactive neutrophil chemotaxis influences responses to anti-TNF-α treatment, and IL13RA2 is a potential biomarker to predict anti-TNF-α treatment response.© 2021 The Authors.

  Title: Clinical features of 44 patients with small bowel Crohn's disease.
  Abstract: At present, there are many studies on Crohn's disease of terminal ileum and colon, but few studies on Crohn's disease of small intestine alone. This study aims to analyze the clinical features and therapeutic effect of small bowel in adult patients with Crohn's disease so as to strengthen the diagnosis and treatment for this disease.From July 1, 2015 to October 31, 2018, patients with small bowel Crohn's disease at Department of Gastroenterology, Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, were enrolled. At the same time, patients' demographics and clinical data were collected.A total of 44 patients were small bowel Crohn's disease. Among them, 40 patients were male. The age at diagnosis was (35.8±10.3) years old and disease duration was (35.2±59.5) months. The subtypes included 29(65.9%) of ileum, 7(15.9%) of jejunum, 8(18.2%) of ileum with jejunum. There were 27(61.4%) of stricture behavior, 4(9.1%) of penetrating behavior, and 13(29.5%) of non-stricture and non-penetrating behavior. Endoscopic visible stricture (29/85, 34.1%) was common, followed by longitudinal ulcers (27/85, 31.8%). Non-caseate granulomatous were found in 2 cases (4.5%). The score of Crohn's disease activity index was correlated to hemoglobin, hematocrit, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (all P<0.05). Among the most common symptom of abdominal pain (34/44, 77.3%), 11 patients (25.0%) developed complications (eg. intestinal obstruction) during the follow-up, and 66.7% of patients treated with mesalazine had complications.Patients with ileum account for a large proportion in patients with small bowel Crohn's disease. Stricture is more common in small bowel Crohn's disease. Stricture and longitudinal ulcer are more common under enteroscopy. Crohn's disease activity index is correlated to hemoglobin, red blood cell specific volume, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The most common complication is intestinal obstruction. Mesalazine is less effective on small bowel Crohn's disease.

  Title: Protein Kinase CK2 Maintains Reciprocal Balance Between Th17 and Treg Cells in the Pathogenesis of UC.
  Abstract: T helper 17 and regulatory T cells balance have crucial effects on the development of ulcerative colitis (UC). Currently, how to break this balance has not yet been found. Protein kinase CK2 is involved in the pathogenesis of immune-related disorders. However, its effects on the development of UC are obscure.The level of CK2 in the colonic tissues of UC patients was quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immune-histochemistry. Peripheral blood CD4+ T cells were treated with CK2 inhibitor CX4945 or transfected with Csnk2-interfering lentivirus; the mRNA expression and protein levels of inflammatory cytokines were detected by qRT-PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and flow cytometry. Moreover, CX4945 was administered to trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis mice model for determining the function of CK2 on the regulation of intestinal inflammation.The CK2 level was markedly increased in inflamed mucosa of UC and highly expressed in CD4+ T cells. Blockade of CK2 by CX4945 inhibited Th17 but promoted regulatory T-cell (Treg) immune responses in CD4+ T cells from patients with UC. Moreover, CK2 blockade alleviated TNBS-induced colitis in mice. Inhibition of CK2 suppressed Th17 but promoted Treg differentiation by decreasing the phosphorylation level of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 and increasing the phosphorylation level of STAT5. The RNA-Seq and co-immunoprecipitation analysis further showed that CK2 could interact with Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and downregulate SIRT1 expression, which participated in Th17 inhibition but promoted Treg differentiation. Sirtuin 1 upregulation ameliorated TNBS-induced colitis, whereas SIRT1 blockade aggravated TNBS-induced colitis in mice.CK2 have crucial effects on the development of UC by maintaining reciprocal balance between Th17 and Treg cells. Protein kinase CK2 blockade might be considered as a new therapeutic approach for UC treatment.© 2021 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

  Title: Protein Kinase CK2 Maintains Reciprocal Balance Between Th17 and Treg Cells in the Pathogenesis of UC.
  Abstract: T helper 17 and regulatory T cells balance have crucial effects on the development of ulcerative colitis (UC). Currently, how to break this balance has not yet been found. Protein kinase CK2 is involved in the pathogenesis of immune-related disorders. However, its effects on the development of UC are obscure.The level of CK2 in the colonic tissues of UC patients was quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immune-histochemistry. Peripheral blood CD4+ T cells were treated with CK2 inhibitor CX4945 or transfected with Csnk2-interfering lentivirus; the mRNA expression and protein levels of inflammatory cytokines were detected by qRT-PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and flow cytometry. Moreover, CX4945 was administered to trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis mice model for determining the function of CK2 on the regulation of intestinal inflammation.The CK2 level was markedly increased in inflamed mucosa of UC and highly expressed in CD4+ T cells. Blockade of CK2 by CX4945 inhibited Th17 but promoted regulatory T-cell (Treg) immune responses in CD4+ T cells from patients with UC. Moreover, CK2 blockade alleviated TNBS-induced colitis in mice. Inhibition of CK2 suppressed Th17 but promoted Treg differentiation by decreasing the phosphorylation level of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 and increasing the phosphorylation level of STAT5. The RNA-Seq and co-immunoprecipitation analysis further showed that CK2 could interact with Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and downregulate SIRT1 expression, which participated in Th17 inhibition but promoted Treg differentiation. Sirtuin 1 upregulation ameliorated TNBS-induced colitis, whereas SIRT1 blockade aggravated TNBS-induced colitis in mice.CK2 have crucial effects on the development of UC by maintaining reciprocal balance between Th17 and Treg cells. Protein kinase CK2 blockade might be considered as a new therapeutic approach for UC treatment.© 2021 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

  Title: Plasma creatinine below limit of quantification in a patient with acute kidney injury.
  Abstract: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an infrequent complication of inflammatory bowel disease and can be exceptionally linked to interstitial nephritis secondary to anti-inflammatory drugs, such as Pentasa® (5-ASA).We present an case of an 80-year-old man who presented chronic diarrheas treated by Pentasa®. He developed AKI, evidenced by high plasma creatinine dosed in his local laboratory. At the hospital admission, plasma creatinine was exceptionally undetectable by the enzymatic method while Jaffe's method successfully determined it. Creatinine measurement by the enzymatic method was gradually restored during hospital stay, concomitant with the discontinuation of 5-ASA administration, suggesting that this drug could interfere with creatinine enzymatic assay. Creatinine enzymatic assays combine serial reactions. The last one called Trinder reaction, catalyzed by a peroxidase, uses H2O2 to convert uncolored dye in a colored compound, proportionally to creatinine concentration. We showed that AKI related-plasma accumulation of 5-ASA, could participate in the negative interference observed on creatinine measurement, by scavenging H2O2. Interestingly, all Trinder reaction-based measurements (uric acid, lipase, lactate, triglycerides and cholesterol) were affected. Negative interference of 5-ASA was confirmed by interferogram experiments on all Trinder reaction-dependent assays.All Trinder-dependent parameters should be interpreted with the patient's treatment knowledge, in particular salicylate derivatives.Copyright © 2021.

  Title: Kidney function monitoring in inflammatory bowel disease: The MONITORED consensus.
  Abstract: Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are exposed to drug-related nephrotoxicity and kidney-related extra-intestinal manifestations (EIMs). Patients should be monitored but guidance is lacking in current international recommendations. The objective of the Kidney Function Monitoring in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (MONITORED) initiative was to achieve an expert consensus about monitoring kidney function in IBD.A literature review was first conducted. Then, an expert consensus meeting, involving 28 attendees representing French-speaking gastroenterologists and nephrologists, was held as part of an academic initiative on May 28, 2021. An anonymous Delphi process was used to discuss and vote on statements. Agreement was defined as at least 75% of participants voting for any one statement.Experts reached consensus on 11 criteria for referral to the nephrologist. Concerning kidney function monitoring, participants unanimously validated the use of serum creatinine with estimation of the glomerular filtration rate via the MDRD or CKD-EPI equations. A blood ionogram and a urine sample with measurement of a protein-to-creatinine ratio were also broadly agreed validated. Experts recommended performing this monitoring at IBD diagnosis, prior introducing a new treatment, and annually for EIMs screening and evaluation of treatment tolerance. An evaluation 3 months after starting mesalamine and then every 6 months was felt necessary, while for biologics an annually monitoring was deemed sufficient.The MONITORED consensus proposed guidelines on how to monitor kidney function in IBD. These recommendations should be considered in clinical practice to preserve kidney function and ensure the best approach to our patients.Copyright © 2021 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

  Title: Study of the therapeutic effects of Painong powder on ulcerative colitis and the role of Platycodonis Radix in the prescription based on pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, and tissue distribution analyses.
  Abstract: Herbal formulas have unique efficacy and are of great significance to the theory and practice of Chinese medicine and are therefore gaining increasing attention in research. Painong powder (PNS), composed of Aurantii fructus immaturus (Zhishi in Chinese, ZS), Paeoniae Radix Alba (Baishao in Chinese, BS), and Platycodonis Radix (Jiegeng in Chinese, JG), has remarkable effects on the detoxification and discharge of pus. JG is traditionally used to treat pulmonary carbuncles and is considered a 'medicinal guide'. According to the composition theory of prescriptions, JG is an 'assistant and guide' medicine. The role of JG as an adjuvant has gained increasing attention.The study was designed to prove the efficacy of PNS in ulcerative colitis (UC) and to study the role of JG in PNS via pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, and tissue distribution analyses.For the pharmacodynamic study, the UC rat model was induced using 5% trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). The results of the macroscopic characterization, histological analysis, and cytokine levels, including those of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), were integrated to evaluate the treatment of UC with PNS. In addition, an LC-MS/MS method was established and validated to analyze the blood pharmacokinetic parameters and tissue distribution of naringin and paeoniflorin.After the administration of high-dose PNS, the UC rats showed amelioration of macroscopic damage at the lesion site. The cytokine levels in the plasma, colon, and lung tissues were also decreased. The pharmacokinetic parameters showed that compared with UC rats administered with PNS-JG, those administered with PNS showed an increase in the AUC, MRT, and Tmax of naringin and paeoniflorin, and a decrease in their clearance rate. Furthermore, naringin and paeoniflorin had higher concentrations in the colon and lung tissues in the normal and model groups administered with PNS than in those administered with PNS-JG.PNS was shown to have marked therapeutic efficacy against TNBS-induced UC in rats. The effect of JG in PNS was reflected by the differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters and tissue distribution of the active components, providing valuable information for the clinical application of PNS in the treatment of UC. However, knowledge about how JG works as an adjuvant medicine in PNS is still lacking.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

  Title: Iron Deficiency Anemia in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases-A Narrative Review.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. IBD has been associated with numerous symptoms and complications, with the most common being iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Iron deficiency in IBD is caused by inadequate intake, malabsorption (including duodenal involvement and surgical removal), and chronic blood loss by mucosal ulcerations. Therefore, an appropriate diet should be enforced. Iron deficiency and iron supplementation have been associated with alterations to gut microbiota. IBD-associated anemia, in particular iron deficiency anemia, is associated with a significant decrease in quality of life and with clinical symptoms such as chronic fatigue, headaches and dizziness, reduced exercise tolerance, pale skin, nails, conjunctiva, and fainting. However, despite these numerous adverse symptoms, IDA remains undertreated. The European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) guidelines state that patients should be monitored for anemia. Adequate treatment, whether oral or intravenous, should be implemented while taking into consideration C-reactive protein values (CRP), hemoglobin levels, and therapeutic response. It should be stressed that every case of anemia in IBD patients should be treated. Intravenous iron formulations, which are more superior compared to the oral form, should be used. There is a need to increase awareness and implementation of international guidelines on iron supplementation in patients with IBD.

  Title: Impairment of CD4+ T and Memory B Cell Responses but Normal Memory CD8+T-Cell Activation on Crohn's Disease after COVID-19 Vaccination: A Twin Case.
  Abstract: Vaccines to prevent the impact of SARS-CoV-2 are now available, including for patients with autoimmune diseases. However, there is no information about how inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment could impact the cellular and humoral immune responses. This study evaluated SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular responses after vaccination with a two-dose schedule in a Crohn's disease patient treated with Infliximab (10 mg/kg); we included comparisons with a monozygotic twin. The results showed that the Crohn's disease's twin (twin 2) had no antibody detection and reduced activation of CD4+ T cell responses, unlike the twin without the autoimmune disease (twin 1). Twin 2 developed antigen-specific central memory CD8+ T-cells and IFNγ production after the second dose of COVID-19 vaccination, similar to twin 1. These findings elucidated the role of T-cell immunity after COVID-19 immunization on IBD patients despite the lack of antibody production. Finally, our observation supports the consensus recommendation for IBD patients to receive COVID-19 vaccines.

  Title: The herbal preparation STW 5 affects serotonergic pathways in the brain and colon as well as stress parameters in experimental irritable bowel syndrome.
  Abstract: Exposure to stress has been related to disturbance in 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) signaling in the brain-gut axis and is considered as a major predisposing factor for the development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The present study aimed to investigate the possible involvement of 5-HT and some other stress-related parameters in the effectiveness of STW 5 against stress-induced IBS.Rats were subjected to restraint stress (RS) for 1 h/day for 14 consecutive days to induce IBS-like symptoms and were given STW 5 orally at the same time. At the end of the experiment, blood samples were withdrawn, then animals were euthanized and the brain hippocampi, cerebral cortices, as well as colons were isolated for biochemical and histopathological assessments.RS increased the plasma corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) with concomitant increase in hippocampal and cortical 5-HT levels, as well as mast cell inflammatory mediators, oxidative stress biomarkers, and histopathological inflammatory changes observed in rat colon. It also decreased the colonic content of 5-HT with consequent decrease in fecal pellet output (FPO). Treatment with STW 5 protected against these changes.The protective effect of STW 5 against RS-induced IBS is related to its ability to normalize the induced changes in 5-HT in the brain-gut axis and counteract the stress-induced oxidative stress and inflammation.© 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

  Title: Inhibitor of Differentiation-2 Protein Ameliorates DSS-Induced Ulcerative Colitis by Inhibiting NF-κB Activation in Neutrophils.
  Abstract: The loss of inhibitor of differentiation-2 (ID2) could lead to the development of colitis in mice, supplementation with exogenous ID2 protein might be a potential strategy to ameliorate colitis. In this study, the effects of ID2 protein supplementation on Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis were investigated. Firstly, we confirmed that the expression of ID2 was reduced in the colon tissues of DSS-induced colitis mice and patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Then, we constructed a recombinant plasmid containing the human Id2 gene and expressed it in Escherichia coli (E. coli) successfully. After purification and identification, purified hID2 could ameliorate DSS-induced colitis efficiently in mice by improving disease symptoms, decreasing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in colon tissues, maintaining the integrity of intestinal barrier and reducing the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages in the colon. Further study showed that hID2 could be endocytosed efficiently by neutrophils and macrophages, and hID2 lost its protection function against colitis when neutrophils were depleted with an anti-Gr-1 antibody. hID2 decreased the mRNA levels of IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-stimulated neutrophils and efficiently inhibited the activation of NF-κB signalling pathway in neutrophils. Interestingly, hID2 showed a synergistic role in inhibition of NF-κB activation with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamic acid (PDTC), an inhibitor of NF-κB activation. Therefore, this study demonstrated the potential use of hID2 to treat UC, and hID2 protein might be a promising anti-inflammatory agent that targets the NF-κB signalling pathway in neutrophils.Copyright © 2021 Ren, Yan, Wang, Zhang, Li, Xiong, Jing, Li, Zhao, Xiong, Wu and Zhong.

  Title: Research-Based Product Innovation to Address Critical Unmet Needs of Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.
  Abstract: Despite progress in recent decades, patients with inflammatory bowel diseases face many critical unmet needs, demonstrating the limitations of available treatment options. Addressing these unmet needs will require interventions targeting multiple aspects of inflammatory bowel disease pathology, including disease drivers that are not targeted by available therapies. The vast majority of late-stage investigational therapies also focus primarily on a narrow range of fundamental mechanisms. Thus, there is a pressing need to advance to clinical stage differentiated investigational therapies directly targeting a broader range of key mechanistic drivers of inflammatory bowel diseases. In addition, innovations are critically needed to enable treatments to be tailored to the specific underlying abnormal biological pathways of patients; interventions with improved safety profiles; biomarkers to develop prognostic, predictive, and monitoring tests; novel devices for nonpharmacological approaches such as minimally invasive monitoring; and digital health technologies. To address these needs, the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation launched IBD Ventures, a venture philanthropy-funding mechanism, and IBD Innovate®, an innovative, product-focused scientific conference. This special IBD Innovate® supplement is a collection of articles reflecting the diverse and exciting research and development that is currently ongoing in the inflammatory bowel disease field to deliver innovative and differentiated products addressing critical unmet needs of patients. Here, we highlight the pipeline of new product opportunities currently advancing at the preclinical and early clinical development stages. We categorize and describe novel and differentiated potential product opportunities based on their potential to address the following critical unmet patient needs: (1) biomarkers for prognosis of disease course and prediction/monitoring of treatment response; (2) restoration of eubiosis; (3) restoration of barrier function and mucosal healing; (4) more effective and safer anti-inflammatories; (5) neuromodulatory and behavioral therapies; (6) management of disease complications; and (7) targeted drug delivery.© 2021 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

  Title: Risk of Cancer in Paediatric onset Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Nation-wide Study From the epi-IIRN.
  Abstract: Paediatric onset IBD [PIBD] is characterised by a more extensive phenotype than adult-onset IBD and a higher utilisation of immunosuppressive medications; both may be associated with malignancy. We aimed to assess the risk of cancer in a nationwide cohort of PIBD and to explore the risks associated with medical treatments.PIBD patients [<18 years old] were included from the epi-IIRN cohort, covering 98% of the Israeli population from 2005, linked to the national cancer registry. We matched PIBD children to non-IBD children for calculating the cumulative incidence of cancer.In all, 3944 PIBD cases were included (2642 [67%] Crohn's disease, 1302 [33%] ulcerative colitis) translating into 23 635 person-years of follow-up, individually matched to 13 005 non-IBD children. By 30 years of age, 14 IBD patients [0.35%, 5.9/10 000 patient-years] were diagnosed with cancer and one [0.03%] with haemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis [HLH], compared with 14 [0.11%, 1.9/10 000 patient-years] cases of cancer {relative risk (RR) 2.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-6.2); p = 0.04} and no HLH in the comparison-group. There were no cases of hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma, adenocarcinoma, or cholangiocarcinoma. Cancer risk was 15.6 cases/10 000 person-years in those treated with thiopurines alone (RR compared with IBD patients never exposed to either thiopurines or anti-tumuor necrosis factor [TNF] 1.8 [95% CI 0.6-6.1]; p = 0.2), 11.1/10 000 in those treated with anti-TNF alone (RR 1.3 [95% CI 0.3-6.6]; p = 0.5), and 23.1/10 000 treated with combination therapy of anti-TNF and thiopurines (RR 2.8 [95% CI 0.6-13.8]; p = 0.2).PIBD confers an increased risk for malignancy compared with non-IBD in children. However, the absolute risk is very low and no differences in risk with specific therapies were apparent in our data.© The Author(s) 2021.

  Title: High-dose vitamin C therapy for symptomatic deficiency in a patient with myasthenia gravis and Crohn's disease.
  Abstract: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is an essential water-soluble antioxidant, and deficiency (ie, plasma level <11 μmol/L) can result in scurvy. People at the highest risk for vitamin C deficiency (ie, scurvy) are those with inadequate intake, such as patients with alcohol abuse disorder, malnutrition, psychiatric disorders, restrictive eating habits, and food insecurity, as well as those with malabsorptive syndromes. We present a case of a 26-year-old woman with Crohn's colitis, myasthenia gravis, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis who presented with frequent bruising, epistaxis, and excessive bleeding from small cuts and who was found to be deficient in vitamin C. Plasma levels initially normalized with oral vitamin C supplementation, but bleeding symptoms eventually returned despite high-dose oral supplementation with 2000 mg daily. She ultimately required routine intravenous supplementation in the home setting for the normalization of levels and the resolution of symptoms. Case reports of vitamin C deficiency typically involve patients with an inadequate intake of vitamin C-containing foods or inadequate absorption. In contrast, our patient reported a regular intake of vitamin C-containing foods, in addition to oral supplementation, but continued to have difficulty maintaining normal vitamin C levels. Scurvy should be considered for any patient with symptoms of bleeding, petechiae, or ecchymosis and, although it can typically be treated with oral vitamin C, intravenous repletion may be necessary in some cases.© 2021 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.

  Title: Development and In Vivo Evaluation of Pectin Based Enteric Coated Microparticles Loaded with Mesalamine and Saccharomyces boulardii for Management of Ulcerative Colitis.
  Abstract: Mesalamine is the first-line choice of drug for ulcerative colitis management. However, due to the nontargeted delivery of mesalamine, it shows side effects. The possible impact of mesalamine can be improved by coated microparticles in combination with S. boulardii for targeted delivery to the colon with the prevention of unwanted side effects. In this work, pectin-based mesalamine and S. boulardii loaded microparticles were prepared by dehydration technique and coated by an oil-in-oil solvent evaporation method and characterized by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction, and zeta analysis. 2, 4, 6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid was used for the induction of colitis. The anti-inflammatory effects of coated microparticles on Caco-2 cells were assessed by the determination of interleukin (IL)-8 concentration. In addition, the impact of coated microparticles on the concentration of colonic enzymes, including myeloperoxidase (MPO), lipid peroxides, and glutathione (GSH), were also evaluated. Moreover, hematological parameters, including white blood cell (WBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP), were assessed. SEM data revealed that all the prepared coated microparticles had an almost spherical shape. The X-ray powder diffraction analysis of uncoated and coated microparticles showed maximum stability without any interaction. The particle size of uncoated and coated microparticles was 9.14 and 15.61 μm, respectively. The zeta potential of uncoated and coated microparticles was observed to be -26.78 and -29.36 mV, respectively. The prepared coated microparticles decreased the levels of lipid peroxides, MPO, and GSH significantly in colitis. In the Caco-2 cell culture model, the concentration of IL-8 is decreased significantly. The hematological observations confirmed that the prepared formulation showed a promising decrease in the levels of WBC, CRP, and ESR in diseased animals. Animal experiments revealed that cellulose acetate phthalate coated microparticles of mesalamine and S. boulardii significantly improved the colitis disease conditions of Wistar rats. Hence, cellulose acetate phthalate-coated microparticles of mesalamine and S. boulardii could be recommended as adjuvant therapy to achieve a synergistic effect in the management of UC.

  Title: Development and In Vivo Evaluation of Pectin Based Enteric Coated Microparticles Loaded with Mesalamine and Saccharomyces boulardii for Management of Ulcerative Colitis.
  Abstract: Mesalamine is the first-line choice of drug for ulcerative colitis management. However, due to the nontargeted delivery of mesalamine, it shows side effects. The possible impact of mesalamine can be improved by coated microparticles in combination with S. boulardii for targeted delivery to the colon with the prevention of unwanted side effects. In this work, pectin-based mesalamine and S. boulardii loaded microparticles were prepared by dehydration technique and coated by an oil-in-oil solvent evaporation method and characterized by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction, and zeta analysis. 2, 4, 6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid was used for the induction of colitis. The anti-inflammatory effects of coated microparticles on Caco-2 cells were assessed by the determination of interleukin (IL)-8 concentration. In addition, the impact of coated microparticles on the concentration of colonic enzymes, including myeloperoxidase (MPO), lipid peroxides, and glutathione (GSH), were also evaluated. Moreover, hematological parameters, including white blood cell (WBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP), were assessed. SEM data revealed that all the prepared coated microparticles had an almost spherical shape. The X-ray powder diffraction analysis of uncoated and coated microparticles showed maximum stability without any interaction. The particle size of uncoated and coated microparticles was 9.14 and 15.61 μm, respectively. The zeta potential of uncoated and coated microparticles was observed to be -26.78 and -29.36 mV, respectively. The prepared coated microparticles decreased the levels of lipid peroxides, MPO, and GSH significantly in colitis. In the Caco-2 cell culture model, the concentration of IL-8 is decreased significantly. The hematological observations confirmed that the prepared formulation showed a promising decrease in the levels of WBC, CRP, and ESR in diseased animals. Animal experiments revealed that cellulose acetate phthalate coated microparticles of mesalamine and S. boulardii significantly improved the colitis disease conditions of Wistar rats. Hence, cellulose acetate phthalate-coated microparticles of mesalamine and S. boulardii could be recommended as adjuvant therapy to achieve a synergistic effect in the management of UC. Lay summary Mesalamine is the drug of choice for the management of ulcerative colitis (UC), which inhibits mediators responsible for inflammation. We investigated the in vivo effects of cellulose acetate phthalate-coated microparticles of mesalamine with Saccharomyces boulardii (probiotic) for their efficacy against UC. Our findings evidenced that the combination of mesalamine with S. boulardii showed a synergistic effect in the 2,4,6- trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis model

  Title: Intrarectal Xyloglucan Administration Reduces Disease Severity in the Dextran Sodium Sulfate Model of Mouse Colitis.
  Abstract: The pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel diseases remains poorly understood and treatment remains suboptimal for many patients. We hypothesize that the inflammatory milieu secondarily prolongs the injury and attenuates healing. We propose primary or adjuvant therapy with biocompatible adhesives to restore a barrier to protect submucosal structures, particularly stem cells.We used the well-described mouse dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of colitis resembling human ulcerative colitis to test the therapeutic efficacy of intrarectal administration of the tamarind plant-derived xyloglucan (TXG) polymer adhesive which underwent extensive analytic characterization. Mice in control, DSS-only, TXG-only, and DSS + TXG groups were studied for gross (weight, blood in stool, length of colon) and multiple histologic parameters.Compared to DSS-only mice, TXG prevented the weight loss, occurrence of blood in the stool and colon shortening, with all those parameters not being statistically different from treatment naïve animals. Histologically, there was dramatic and highly statistically significant reduction in the total inflammatory index and protection from goblet cell loss, cellular infiltration, crypt abscess formation, epithelial erosion, granulation tissue, epithelial hyperplasia crypt irregularity and crypt loss. The TXG purity and characterization were established by nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and texture analysis.The striking attenuation of disease severity by intrarectal TXG use warrants future investigations of natural bioadhesives with well-established high safety profiles, and which could potentially be derivatized to include therapeutically active moieties for local drug delivery.© 2021 Ross et al.

  Title: Digestive Toxicities Secondary to Immune Checkpoint Inhibition Therapy - Reports of Rare Events. A Systematic Review.
  Abstract: While immune checkpoint inhibitors therapy (ICI) is exceedingly effective, these drugs are associated with various immune-related adverse effects. As gastrointestinal, hepatic or pancreatic toxicity becomes more common, various reports of rare adverse effects have emerged, leading to a significant clinical and prognostic impact. We aimed to provide a systematic review of mainly case-reports on rare events, to help physicians to make an accurate and fast diagnosis.We performed a systematic review of the literature, using established MeSH terms: "immune checkpoint inhibitors", "gastrointestinal tract", "gastrointestinal diseases", "liver", "pancreas", "nivolumab", "ipilimumab", the subheadings "adverse effects", "toxicity" and the supplementary concepts "pembrolizumab", "tremelimumab", "atezolizumab", "avelumab", "durvalumab", with defined inclusion criteria.From 419 manuscripts initially selected, 74 reports of rare adverse events were included in our review. Special cases of neutrophilic gastritis, hemorrhagic gastritis, or even perforations were described at upper digestive tract. Different types of colitis were found secondary to ICI such as pseudomembranous, granulomatous, collagenous and microscopic colitis or even inflammatory bowel disease. In terms of liver toxicity, we found rare reports of cholangitis, granulomatous hepatitis, lipodystrophy and hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. Pancreas toxicity was rarely reported as severe pancreatitis, exocrine failure and diabetes mellitus.Although a complete check-up of every organ at every routine visit may not be practical, focus on symptoms, targeted laboratory and imaging testing may reveal rare organ damage. Raising awareness of the uncommon toxicities related to the immunotherapy is essential, as some rare events can lead to fatal outcomes.

  Title: A New Role for Conivaptan in Ulcerative Colitis in Mice: Inhibiting Differentiation of CD4+T Cells into Th1 Cells.
  Abstract: Conivaptan, a nonselective antagonist of vasopressin receptors V1a and V2, is the first drug of this class to be used for treating euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. Recently, increasing evidence supports the involvement of vasopressin in immune responses.In this study, we investigated the effect of conivaptan on the modulation of CD4+ T cell homeostasis and the progression of experimental colitis.The expression of the V1a receptor on CD4+ T cells was detected by immunofluorescence and western blot. The subset of isolated CD4+ T cells were examined after arginine vasopressin (AVP) incubation. CD4+ T cells were injected into DNBS-induced mice through the tail vein. The severity of colitis was evaluated according to weight, disease activity index (DAI), and morphological injury. Intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) signaling in CD4+ T cells was measured using the Fluo-3 AM loading method. T-bet and IFN-γ mRNAs in the colon were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).We found that CD4+ T cells expressed the V1a receptor. Activation of the V1a receptor significantly promoted the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into T helper 1 (Th1) cells. This process was blocked by conivaptan treatment. However, the activation of the V1a receptor did not evoke an increase in [Ca2+]i in CD4+ T cells. Notably, conivaptan markedly alleviated body weight loss, pathological damage, and expression of T-bet and IFN-γ in the colon of DNBS-treated mice.For the first time, we report that conivaptan attenuated colitis by inhibiting the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into Th1 cells. Mechanistically, the anti-inflammatory role of conivaptan is independent of [Ca2+]i.© 2021. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

  Title: Classification and clinical features of adverse drug reactions in patients with ulcerative colitis treated with 5-aminosalicylate acid: a single-center, observational study.
  Abstract: 5-Aminosalicylate acid (5-ASA) is a crucial drug for ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. 5-ASA has several side effects. However, the types of side effects vary and are sometimes severe.A single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted from September 2001 to June 2020. We surveyed consecutive UC patients who visited our hospital and investigated adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to 5-ASA formulations. We grouped patients into four subgroups: (1) lupus-like symptoms, (2) blood test abnormalities, (3) mimicking IBD exacerbation and (4) others. Their clinical courses were evaluated.We surveyed 288 consecutive UC patients, 35 of whom developed ADRs of any grade (12.9%), and analyzed 27 patients. The median age and 5-ASA doses were 43 years and 4000 mg, respectively, and 48% were male. The ADR triggers were the first use of 5-ASA (n = 17, 63%), 5-ASA switch (n = 9, 33%) and 5-ASA dose escalation (n = 1, 3.7%). The median time to ADR was 15 days (IQR: 7, 63). Ten patients (37%) had grade 3/4 ADRs. Fever was the most common ADR (n = 6, 23%), followed by hyperamylasemia and headache (n = 4, 15%). Lupus-like symptoms accounted for 56% (n = 15), blood test abnormalities for 26% (n = 7), mimicking IBD exacerbation for 15% (n = 4) and others for 3.7% (n = 1). The time to ADR was shorter in the mimicking IBD exacerbation group (median 11 days) than in the lupus-like symptoms (22 days) and blood test abnormalities (55 days) groups.Classification of ADRs related to 5-ASA into four groups might lead to early recognition of ADRs.

  Title: Crohn's Disease and Early Exposure to Thiopurines are Independent Risk Factors for Mosaic Chromosomal Alterations in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.
  Abstract: Mosaic chromosomal alterations [mCAs] increase the risk for haematopoietic malignancies and may be risk factors for several other diseases. Inflammatory bowel diseases [IBDs], including Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC], are associated with mCAs, and patients may be at risk for haematopoietic malignancy development and/or modification of IBD phenotypes. In the present study, we screened patients with IBD for the presence of mCAs and explored the possible pathophysiological and genetic risk factors for mCAs.We analysed mCAs in peripheral blood from 3339 patients with IBD and investigated the clinical and genetic risk factors for mCAs.CD and exposure to thiopurines before the age of 20 years were identified as novel independent risk factors for mCAs [odds ratio = 2.15 and 5.68, p = 1.17e-2 and 1.60e-3, respectively]. In contrast, there were no significant associations of disease duration, anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha antibodies, or other clinical factors with mCAs. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that genes specifically located in the mCAs in patients with CD were significantly associated with factors related to mucosal immune responses. A genome-wide association study revealed that ERBIN, CD96, and AC068672.2 were significantly associated with mCAs in patients with CD [p = 1.56e-8, 1.65e-8, and 4.92e-8, respectively].The difference in mCAs between patients with CD and UC supports the higher incidence of haematopoietic malignancies in CD. Caution should be exercised when using thiopurines in young patients with IBD, particularly CD, in light of possible chromosomal alterations.© The Author(s) 2021.

We profiled circulating biomarkers and whole blood transcriptional pathway activity to identify those associated with CD using data from the phase 2 FITZROY study with filgotinib, an oral preferential janus kinase-1 inhibitor.Patients with serum and whole blood samples taken from the induction period were included. Serum cytokines were measured (ELISA), whole blood RNA sequenced, and stool samples taken to measure fecal calprotectin (FC). Spearman's Rank correlations were assessed between biomarkers and baseline disease activity; post-treatment endoscopic improvement was measured by the Simplified Endoscopy Score for CD (SES-CD), FC and the Crohn's Disease Activity Index. Effect of filgotinib on circulating biomarkers was also evaluated.Serum biomarkers (n = 168) and whole blood RNA sequencing (n = 104) were assessed. Moderate correlation between serum analytes with SES-CD and FC was noted; most highly correlated were acute phase proteins CRP (rho = 0.35 [SES-CD] and 0.47 [FC]), serum amyloid A (rho = 0.40 and 0.39, respectively) and pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 (rho = 0.31 and 0.30, respectively), IL-22 (rho = 0.36 and 0.35, respectively), and oncostatin M (rho = 0.35 and 0.33, respectively). Filgotinib treatment was associated with reduction of many candidate biomarkers, particularly in patients with treatment response. Early changes in IL-6 and IL-10 may be prognostic for endoscopic response.Several circulating factors with potential as CD activity biomarkers were identified. Larger studies are necessary to investigate the best utility of these markers for CD.© 2021 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

  Title: Fullerene nanoparticles for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a long-term, recurrent inflammatory bowel disease for which no effective cure is yet available in the clinical setting. Repairing the barrier dysfunction of the colon and reducing intestinal inflammation are considered key objectives to cure UC. Here we demonstrate a novel therapeutic strategy based on a C60 fullerene suspension (C60FS) to treat dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced UC in an animal model. C60FS can repair the barrier dysfunction of UC and effectively promote the healing of ulcers; it also manifests better treatment effects compared with mesalazine enema. C60FS can reduce the numbers of basophils in the blood of UC rats and mast cells in the colorectal tissue, thereby effectively alleviating inflammation. The expression of H1R, H4R, and VEGFR2 receptors in colorectal tissues is inhibited by C60FS, and the levels of histamine and prostaglandin in the rat blood are reduced. This work presents a reliable strategy based on fullerene to cure UC and provides a novel guide for UC treatment.© 2021. Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

  Title: Macrophage-Biomimetic Nanoparticles Ameliorate Ulcerative Colitis through Reducing Inflammatory Factors Expression.
  Abstract: Inflammatory mediator S100A9 is dramatically elevated in ulcerative colitis and correlates with disease severity. S100A9 is a potential molecule to target for the treatment of colitis, but to date, there is no effective targeting method. The aim of this study was to develop a safe and effective nano-delivery system targeting S100A9 and to evaluate its therapeutic efficacy in ulcerative colitis mouse model.We designed an oral nano-delivery system using poly (lactic acid-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-loaded S100A9 inhibitor tasquinimod to synthesize PLGA-TAS nanoparticles. TLR4-overexpressing macrophage membranes (MMs) were used to wrap the nanoparticles to make MM-PLGA-TAS, which allowed the nanoparticles to acquire the ability to specifically enrich the colitis region.MM-PLGA-TAS was endocytosed by inflammatory phenotype RAW264.7 cells in vitro and can efficiently enrich in inflamed mouse colitis tissue in vivo. A chemically induced ulcerative colitis mouse model was used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of oral MM-PLGA-TAS. MM-PLGA-TAS significantly alleviated the symptoms of ulcerative colitis, and mechanically, MM-PLGA-TAS achieved immunomodulatory and suppressive effects by reducing S100a9 and other cytokines in the colitis region.We describe a convenient, orally targeted colitis drug delivery system that cures the disease in ulcerative colitis mice. This system substantially increases drug accumulation in inflamed colonic tissue, reduces the risk of systemic exposure, and is a promising therapeutic approach against ulcerative colitis.© 2021 The Author(s) Published by S.

  Title: Therapeutic Advantage of Tyk2 Inhibition for Treating Autoimmune and Chronic Inflammatory Diseases.
  Abstract: Tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) is a member of the Janus family of protein tyrosine kinases (Jaks). Tyk2 associates with interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-β, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-23 receptors and mediates their downstream signaling pathways. Based on our data using Tyk2-deficient mice and cells, Tyk2 plays crucial roles in the differentiation, maintenance, and function of T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells, and its dysregulation may promote autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases. IFN-α-induced growth inhibition of B lymphocyte progenitors is dependent on Tyk2-mediated signals to regulate death-associated protein (Daxx) nuclear localization and Daxx-promyelocytic leukemia protein interactions. Tyk2-deficient mice show impaired constitutive production of type I IFNs by macrophages under steady-state conditions. When heat-killed Cutibacterium acnes is injected intraperitoneally, Tyk2-deficient mice show less granuloma formation through enhanced prostaglandin E2 and protein kinase A activities, leading to high IL-10 production by macrophages. Thus, Tyk2 is widely involved in the immune and inflammatory response at multiple events; therefore, Tyk2 is likely to be a suitable target for treating patients with autoimmune and/or chronic inflammatory diseases. Clinical trials of Tyk2 inhibitors have shown higher response rates and improved tolerability in the treatment of patients with psoriasis and inflammatory bowel diseases. Taken together, Tyk2 inhibition has great potential for clinical application in the management of a variety of diseases.

  Title: Lower Serologic Response to COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Treated With Anti-TNFα.
  Abstract: Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), specifically those treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α biologics, are at high risk for vaccine-preventable infections. Their ability to mount adequate vaccine responses is unclear. The aim of the study was to assess serologic responses to messenger RNA-Coronavirus Disease 2019 vaccine, and safety profile, in patients with IBD stratified according to therapy, compared with healthy controls (HCs).Prospective, controlled, multicenter Israeli study. Subjects enrolled received 2 BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) doses. Anti-spike antibody levels and functional activity, anti-TNFα levels and adverse events (AEs) were detected longitudinally.Overall, 258 subjects: 185 IBD (67 treated with anti-TNFα, 118 non-anti-TNFα), and 73 HCs. After the first vaccine dose, all HCs were seropositive, whereas ∼7% of patients with IBD, regardless of treatment, remained seronegative. After the second dose, all subjects were seropositive, however anti-spike levels were significantly lower in anti-TNFα treated compared with non-anti-TNFα treated patients, and HCs (both P < .001). Neutralizing and inhibitory functions were both lower in anti-TNFα treated compared with non-anti-TNFα treated patients, and HCs (P < .03; P < .0001, respectively). Anti-TNFα drug levels and vaccine responses did not affect anti-spike levels. Infection rate (∼2%) and AEs were comparable in all groups. IBD activity was unaffected by BNT162b2.In this prospective study in patients with IBD stratified according to treatment, all patients mounted serologic response to 2 doses of BNT162b2; however, its magnitude was significantly lower in patients treated with anti-TNFα, regardless of administration timing and drug levels. Vaccine was safe. As vaccine serologic response longevity in this group may be limited, vaccine booster dose should be considered.Copyright © 2022 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

  Title: Small bowel adenocarcinoma in Crohn's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence, manifestation, histopathology, and outcomes.
  Abstract: Small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) is a rare neoplasm that is associated with Crohn's disease (CD). This study aims to quantify the prevalence of CD-SBA, review the current evidence of histopathology and molecular analysis findings, and identify the clinical presentation and outcomes of CD-SBA.Electronic databases Medline and Embase were searched for articles describing SBA in inflammatory bowel disease patients. The histopathology, molecular analysis findings, clinical presentation, prevalence, and outcomes of CD-SBA were extracted, and results were pooled with random effects.In total, 33 articles were included in the analysis. Prevalence of SBA was 1.15 (CI: 0.31-2.33) per 1000 CD patients. Only 11% (CI: 0.04-0.21) of CD-SBA patients had observable radiological features. CD-SBA was most commonly found in the ileum (84%), diagnosed at stage 2 (36%), with main presenting complaints including obstruction, weight loss, and abdominal pain. Significant histopathological findings included adjacent epithelial dysplasia, and an equal distribution of well-differentiated (49%) and poorly differentiated subtypes (46%). Most prevalent genetic mutation was KRAS mutation (18%), followed by mismatch repair deficiency (9.7%). The 5-year overall survival for CD-SBA patients was 29% (CI: 0.18-0.41), and 33% (CI: 0.26-0.41) for de novo SBA. No statistically significant increase in risk for CD-SBA was noted for treatment with thiopurines, steroids, and 5-ASA.Our meta-analysis found the prevalence of CD-SBA to be 1.15 per 1000 CD patients. The 5-year overall survival for CD-SBA was poor. The presenting symptoms were non-specific, and therefore the diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion.© 2021.

  Title: Alterations in MAdCAM1-Positive Mucosal Capillaries and Integrin a4b7-Positive Lymphocytes in Crohn's Disease Treated with Anti-TNFα Biologics.
  Abstract: To elucidate the reasons for the decreased effectiveness of Vedolizumab (VDZ) treatment in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) previously treated (CD-T) with anti-TNF-α biologics.Immunohistochemical staining was performed on sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ileocolonic biopsies using antibodies for the mucosal addressin molecule (MAdCAM-1) and Etrolizumab.The mean number of MAdCAM-1 positive capillaries (MAdCAM-1-C) was 3 in controls, 8.5 in CD, 5.37 in CD-T, 5.7 in ulcerative colitis (UC), and 3.1 in lymphocytic colitis (LC) (p=0.0032). When all biopsies with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in this series were considered together, the number of MAdCAM-1-C increased with an increased histologic activity score (HAS) (p<0.001). The mean MAd-CAM-1-C was lower in CD-T than CD (5.37 vs. 8.5, p=0.0362), even in cases with high HAS (6.46 vs. 9.5, p=0.073). Two of 6 (33%) controls, 4 of 6 (67%) CD, 9 of 16 (56%) CD-T, 6 of 7 (86%) UC, and 0 of 8 (0%) LC showed Etrolizumab-positive lymphocytes (E-Ly, p=0.0106). IBD biopsies positive for E-Ly were associated with higher HAS (p=0.0546). MAdCAM-1-C was heterogenous in some IBD cases.Our results suggest that treatment with anti-TNF-α reduces the number of MAdCAM-1-C in CD, even in biopsies with high HAS. This suggests that high inflammation in such cases obviously failed to respond to anti-TNF-α, may be less dependent on the migration of a4b7-lymphocytes to the inflamed mucosa, and therefore may not optimally respond to VDZ treatment.Presented in part at the Digestive Diseases Week meeting, San Diego, CA, May 2019.

  Title: Prebiotic Galactooligosaccharide Supplementation in Adults with Ulcerative Colitis: Exploring the Impact on Peripheral Blood Gene Expression, Gut Microbiota, and Clinical Symptoms.
  Abstract: Prebiotics may promote immune homeostasis and reduce sub-clinical inflammation in humans. This study investigated the effect of prebiotic galactooligosaccharide (GOS) supplementation in colonic inflammation. Seventeen patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC) consumed 2.8 g/d GOS for 6 weeks. At baseline and 6 weeks, gene expression (microarray), fecal calprotectin (ELISA), microbiota (16S rRNA), short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs; gas-liquid chromatography), and clinical outcomes (simple clinical colitis activity index (SCCAI), gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS), and Bristol stool form scale (BSFS)) were measured. Following prebiotics, clinical scores (SCCAI), fecal calprotectin, SCFAs, and pH were unchanged. Five genes were upregulated and two downregulated. Normal stool proportion (BSFS) increased (49% vs. 70%, p = 0.024), and the incidence (46% vs. 23%, p = 0.016) and severity (0.7 vs. 0.5, p = 0.048) of loose stool (GSRS), along with urgency (SCCAI) scores (1.0 vs. 0.5, p = 0.011), were reduced. In patients with a baseline SCCAI ≤2, prebiotics increased the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium from 1.65% (1.97) to 3.99% (5.37) (p = 0.046) and Christensenellaceae from 0.13% (0.33) to 0.31% (0.76) (p = 0.043). Prebiotics did not lower clinical scores or inflammation but normalized stools. Bifidobacterium and Christensenellaceae proportions only increased in patients with less active diseases, indicating that the prebiotic effect may depend on disease activity. A controlled study is required to validate these observations.

  Title: Active Targeted Nanoemulsions for Repurposing of Tegaserod in Alzheimer's Disease Treatment.
  Abstract: The activation of 5-HT4 receptors with agonists has emerged as a valuable therapeutic strategy to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) by enhancing the nonamyloidogenic pathway. Here, the potential therapeutic effects of tegaserod, an effective agent for irritable bowel syndrome, were assessed for AD treatment. To envisage its efficient repurposing, tegaserod-loaded nanoemulsions were developed and functionalized by a blood-brain barrier shuttle peptide.The butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activity of tegaserod and its neuroprotective cellular effects were highlighted, confirming the interest of this pleiotropic drug for AD treatment. In regard to its drugability profile, and in order to limit its peripheral distribution after IV administration, its encapsulation into monodisperse lipid nanoemulsions (Tg-NEs) of about 50 nm, and with neutral zeta potential characteristics, was performed. The stability of the formulation in stock conditions at 4 °C and in blood biomimetic medium was established. The adsorption on Tg-NEs of peptide-22 was realized. The functionalized NEs were characterized by chromatographic methods (SEC and C18/HPLC) and isothermal titration calorimetry, attesting the efficiency of the adsorption. From in vitro assays, these nanocarriers appeared suitable for enabling tegaserod controlled release without hemolytic properties.The developed peptide-22 functionalized Tg-NEs appear as a valuable tool to allow exploration of the repurposed tegaserod in AD treatment in further preclinical studies.

  Title: Baicalein ameliorates ulcerative colitis by improving intestinal epithelial barrier via AhR/IL-22 pathway in ILC3s.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, which is closely related to gut barrier dysfunction. Emerging evidence shows that interleukin-22 (IL-22) derived from group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) confers benefits on intestinal barrier, and IL-22 expression is controlled by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Previous studies show that baicalein protects the colon from inflammatory damage. In this study we elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effect of baicalein on intestinal barrier function in colitis mice. Mice were administered baicalein (10, 20, 40 mg·kg-1·d-1, i.g.) for 10 days; the mice freely drank 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) on D1-D7 to induce colitis. We showed that baicalein administration simultaneously ameliorated gut inflammation, decreased intestinal permeability, restored tight junctions of colons possibly via promoting AhR/IL-22 pathway. Co-administration of AhR antagonist CH223191 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) partially blocked the therapeutic effects of baicalein in colitis mice, whereas AhR agonist FICZ (1 μg, i.p.) ameliorated symptoms and gut barrier function in colitis mice. In a murine lymphocyte line MNK-3, baicalein (5-20 μM) dose-dependently increased the expression of AhR downstream target protein CYP1A1, and enhanced IL-22 production through facilitating AhR nuclear translocation, these effects were greatly diminished in shAhR-MNK3 cells, suggesting that baicalein induced IL-22 production in AhR-dependent manner. To further clarify that, we constructed an in vitro system consisting of MNK-3 and Caco-2 cells, in which MNK-3 cell supernatant treated with baicalein could decrease FITC-dextran permeability and promoted the expression of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occluding in Caco-2 cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that baicalein ameliorates colitis by improving intestinal epithelial barrier via AhR/IL-22 pathway in ILC3s, thus providing a potential therapy for UC.© 2021.

Previous studies show that baicalein protects the colon from inflammatory damage. In this study we elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effect of baicalein on intestinal barrier function in colitis mice.

We showed that baicalein administration simultaneously ameliorated gut inflammation, decreased intestinal permeability, restored tight junctions of colons possibly via promoting AhR/IL-22 pathway.

  Title: A First Report of HCTZ and Dicyclomine Induced Uncharacteristic Contraction Alkalosis.
  Abstract: Background: Contraction alkalosis is characterized by low serum sodium and chloride and high serum carbon dioxide and bicarbonate levels. Case Report: A 28-year-old Caucasian active-duty male with a history of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and diarrhea-predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (D-IBS) presented to his primary care provider (PCP) with elevated blood pressure (136/96 mmHg), was diagnosed with stage-2 hypertension, and started oral HCTZ (25 mg/day). His medications included dicyclomine (10 mg oral three times daily). Subsequently, (Visit 1), his blood pressure was 130/91 mmHg and he was started on telmisartan (20 mg/day). At Visit 2, 4 weeks later, his blood pressure improved (121/73 mmHg); however, blood chemistry revealed elevated serum CO2 (32 mEq/L) and chloride (94 mmol/L). Four days later, the patient presented to the Emergency Department with dyspnea and swallowing difficulty. The patient returned to his PCP 3 days later complaining of cough, congestion, vomiting, and mild dyspnea, blood pressure of 124/84 mmHg. Two months later, sudden onset of projectile vomiting and abdominal pain while running was reported, resolved by rehydration and a single oral dose of prochlorperazine 25 mg. Three months later, (Visit 3), he complained of lightheadedness and cloudy judgment, suggesting contraction alkalosis. HCTZ was discontinued and telmisartan was increased to 20 mg twice daily. A follow-up blood chemistry panel 2 weeks later revealed serum chloride and CO2 levels within normal limits and blood pressure under 130/80 mmHg. Conclusion: This is the first known report of contraction alkalosis driven by drug-drug interaction between dicyclomine and HCTZ.

  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, although its etiology has largely been unclear. Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNF-I) are effective for the treatment. Recently, biosimilars of TNF-I, such as CT-P13, have been developed and are thought to possess equal efficacy and safety to the original TNF-I. Sarcoidosis is also a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. In steroid-resistant cases of sarcoidosis, TNF-I have been reported effective for achieving resolution. However, the progression of sarcoidosis due to the TNF-I also has been reported. We herein report a case of pulmonary sarcoidosis with a Crohn's disease (CD) patient developed after a long period administration (15 years) of TNF-I.A 37-year-old woman with CD who had been diagnosed at 22 years old had been treated with the TNF-I (original infliximab; O-IFX and infliximab biosimilar; IFX-BS). Fifteen years after starting the TNF-I, she developed a fever and right chest pain. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed clustered small nodules in both lungs and multiple enlarged hilar lymph nodes. Infectious diseases including tuberculosis were negative. Bronchoscopic examination was performed and the biopsy specimens were obtained. A pathological examination demonstrated noncaseating granulomatous lesions and no malignant findings. TNF-I were discontinued because of the possibility of TNF-I-related sarcoidosis. After having discontinued for four months, her symptoms and the lesions had disappeared completely. Fortunately, despite the discontinuation of TNF-I, she has maintained remission.To our knowledge, this is the first case in which sarcoidosis developed after switching from O-IFX to IFX-BS. To clarify the characteristics of the cases with development of sarcoidosis during administration of TNF-I, we searched PubMed and identified 106 cases. When developing an unexplained fever, asthenia, uveitis and skin lesions in patients with TNF-I treatment, sarcoidosis should be suspected. Once the diagnosis of sarcoidosis due to TNF-I was made, the discontinuation of TNF-I and administration of steroid therapy should be executed promptly. When re-starting TNF-I, another TNF-I should be used for disease control. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of sarcoidosis in patients under anti-TNF therapy.© 2021. The Author(s).

  Title: Carboxylesterase-1 Assisted Targeting of HDAC Inhibitors to Mononuclear Myeloid Cells in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Abstract: Histone deacetylase inhibitors [HDACi] exert potent anti-inflammatory effects. Because of the ubiquitous expression of HDACs, clinical utility of HDACi is limited by off-target effects. Esterase-sensitive motif [ESM] technology aims to deliver ESM-conjugated compounds to human mononuclear myeloid cells, based on their expression of carboxylesterase 1 [CES1]. This study aims to investigate utility of an ESM-tagged HDACi in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD].CES1 expression was assessed in human blood, in vitro differentiated macrophage and dendritic cells, and Crohn's disease [CD] colon mucosa, by mass cytometry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction [PCR], and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. ESM-HDAC528 intracellular retention was evaluated by mass spectrometry. Clinical efficacy of ESM-HDAC528 was tested in dextran sulphate sodium [DSS]-induced colitis and T cell transfer colitis models using transgenic mice expressing human CES1 under the CD68 promoter.CES1 mRNA was highly expressed in human blood CD14+ monocytes, in vitro differentiated and lipopolysaccharide [LPS]-stimulated macrophages, and dendritic cells. Specific hydrolysis and intracellular retention of ESM-HDAC528 in CES1+ cells was demonstrated. ESM-HDAC528 inhibited LPS-stimulated IL-6 and TNF-α production 1000 times more potently than its control, HDAC800, in CES1high monocytes. In healthy donor peripheral blood, CES1 expression was significantly higher in CD14++CD16- monocytes compared with CD14+CD16++ monocytes. In CD-inflamed colon, a higher number of mucosal CD68+ macrophages expressed CES1 compared with non-inflamed mucosa. In vivo, ESM-HDAC528 reduced monocyte differentiation in the colon and significantly improved colitis in a T cell transfer model, while having limited potential in ameliorating DSS-induced colitis.We demonstrate that monocytes and inflammatory macrophages specifically express CES1, and can be preferentially targeted by ESM-HDAC528 to achieve therapeutic benefit in IBD.© The Author(s) 2021.

  Title: GPR65 (TDAG8) inhibits intestinal inflammation and colitis-associated colorectal cancer development in experimental mouse models.
  Abstract: GPR65 (TDAG8) is a proton-sensing G protein-coupled receptor predominantly expressed in immune cells. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified GPR65 gene polymorphisms as an emerging risk factor for the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Patients with IBD have an elevated risk of developing colorectal cancer when compared to the general population. To study the role of GPR65 in intestinal inflammation and colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC), colitis and CAC were induced in GPR65 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and azoxymethane (AOM)/DSS, respectively. Disease severity parameters such as fecal score, colon shortening, histopathology, and mesenteric lymph node enlargement were aggravated in GPR65 KO mice compared to WT mice treated with DSS. Elevated leukocyte infiltration and fibrosis were observed in the inflamed colon of GPR65 KO when compared to WT mice which may represent a cellular mechanism for the observed exacerbation of intestinal inflammation. In line with high expression of GPR65 in infiltrated leukocytes, GPR65 gene expression was increased in inflamed intestinal tissue samples of IBD patients compared to normal intestinal tissues. Moreover, colitis-associated colorectal cancer development was higher in GPR65 KO mice than WT mice when treated with AOM/DSS. Altogether, our data demonstrate that GPR65 suppresses intestinal inflammation and colitis-associated tumor development in murine colitis and CAC models, suggesting potentiation of GPR65 with agonists may have an anti-inflammatory therapeutic effect in IBD and reduce the risk of developing colitis-associated colorectal cancer.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

  Title: An optimally designed anti-human CD40 antibody with potent B cell suppression for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.
  Abstract: Antibodies targeting the CD40-CD40L pathway have great potential for treating autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), lupus nephritis (LN), and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). However, in addition to the known difficulty in generating a purely antagonistic CD40 antibody, the presence of CD40 and CD40L on platelets creates additional unique challenges for the safety, target coverage, and clearance of antibodies targeting this pathway. Previously described therapeutic antibodies targeting this pathway have various shortcomings, and the full therapeutic potential of this axis has yet to be realized. Herein, we describe the generation and characterization of BI 655064, a novel, purely antagonistic anti-CD40 antibody that potently neutralizes CD40-CD40L-dependent B-cell stimulation without evidence of impacting platelet functions. This uniquely optimized antibody targeting a highly challenging pathway was obtained by applying stringent functional and biophysical criteria during the lead selection process. BI 655064 has favorable target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD)-saturation pharmacokinetics, consistent with that of a high-quality therapeutic monoclonal antibody.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

  Title: CD127+ CD94+ innate lymphoid cells expressing granulysin and perforin are expanded in patients with Crohn's disease.
  Abstract: Phenotypic definition of helper ILC1 and NK cells is problematic due to overlapping markers. Recently we showed the identification of cytotoxic ILC3s characterized by expression of CD94. Here we analyse CD127+ ILCs and NK cells in intestinal lamina propria from healthy donors and Crohn's disease patients and identify two populations of CD127+CD94+ ILCs, designated population A and B, that can be distinguished on the expression of CD117, CD18 and cytotoxic molecules. Population B expresses granulysin, a cytotoxic molecule linked to bacterial lysis and/or chemotaxis of monocytes. Granulysin protein is secreted by population B cells upon stimulation with IL-15. Activation of population B in the presence of TGF-β strongly reduces the expression of cytotoxic effector molecules of population B. Strikingly, samples from individuals that suffer from active Crohn's disease display enhanced frequencies of granulysin-expressing effector CD127+CD94+ ILCs in comparison to controls. Thus this study identifies group 1 ILC populations which accumulate in inflamed intestinal tissue of Crohn's disease patients and may play a role in the pathology of the disease.© 2021.

  Title: Formyl Peptide Receptors and Annexin A1: Complementary Mechanisms to Infliximab in Murine Experimental Colitis and Crohn's Disease.
  Abstract: Non-responsiveness to anti-TNF-α therapies presents relevant rates in inflammatory bowel disease patients, presenting the need to find biomarkers involved in therapeutic efficacy. Herein, we demonstrate that higher levels of colonic formyl peptide receptor 1 and annexin A1 correlate with histological recovery in Crohn's disease patients under remission. Using the dextran sulfate sodium colitis model in mice, we suggest that infliximab induces annexin A1 expression and secretion in activated intestinal leukocytes. Conversely, this mechanism might stimulate epithelial formyl peptide receptors, inducing wound healing and consequent histological remission. Our data indicate that assessing intestinal expressions of formyl peptide receptors and annexin A1 might provide precious information on the disease activity and responsiveness to infliximab in inflammatory bowel disease patients.Copyright © 2021 de Paula-Silva, da Rocha, Broering, Queiroz, Sandri, Loiola, Oliani, Vieira, Perretti and Farsky.

  Title: Neobavaisoflavone-mediated TH9 cell differentiation ameliorates bowel inflammation.
  Abstract: Neobavaisoflavone (Neo), is the active constituent of the herb Psoralea corylifolial, used in the traditional Chinese medicine, and has anti-inflammatory activity, but whether Neo could regulate colitis remains unclear. T helper 9 (TH9) cells, a subset of CD4+ T helper cells characterized by secretion of IL-9, have been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, but whether Neo could control TH9 cell differentiation also remains unclear. Here, we found that Neo could decrease IL-9 production of CD4+ T cells by targeting PU.1 in vitro. Importantly, Neo had therapeutic effects on DSS-induced colitis. Furthermore, we identified TH9 cells as the direct target of Neo for attenuating bowel inflammation. Therefore, Neo could serve as a lead for developing new therapeutics against inflammatory bowel disease.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

  Title: Relationship between IGF-1 and body weight in inflammatory bowel diseases: Cellular and molecular mechanisms involved.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), represented by ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, what leads to diarrhea, malnutrition, and weight loss. Depression of the growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor-1 axis (GH-IGF-1 axis) could be responsible of these symptoms. We demonstrate that long-term treatment (54 weeks) of adult CD patients with adalimumab (ADA) results in a decrease in serum IGF-1 without changes in serum IGF-1 binding protein (IGF1BP4). These results prompted us to conduct a preclinical study to test the efficiency of IGF-1 in the medication for experimental colitis. IGF-1 treatment of rats with DSS-induced colitis has a beneficial effect on the following circulating biochemical parameters: glucose, albumin, and total protein levels. In this experimental group we also observed healthy maintenance of colon size, body weight, and lean mass in comparison with the DSS-only group. Histological analysis revealed restoration of the mucosal barrier with the IGF-1 treatment, which was characterized by healthy quantities of mucin production, structural maintenance of adherers junctions (AJs), recuperation of E-cadherin and β-catenin levels and decrease in infiltrating immune cells and in metalloproteinase-2 levels. The experimentally induced colitis caused activation of apoptosis markers, including cleaved caspase 3, caspase 8, and PARP and decreases cell-cycle checkpoint activators including phosphorylated Rb, cyclin E, and E2F1. The IGF-1 treatment inhibited cyclin E depletion and partially protects PARP levels. The beneficial effects of IGF-1 in experimental colitis could be explained by a re-sensitization of the IGF-1/IRS-1/AKT cascade to exogenous IGF-1. Given these results, we postulate that IGF-1 treatment of IBD patients could prove to be successful in reducing disease pathology.Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

  Title: Relationship between IGF-1 and body weight in inflammatory bowel diseases: Cellular and molecular mechanisms involved.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), represented by ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, what leads to diarrhea, malnutrition, and weight loss. Depression of the growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor-1 axis (GH-IGF-1 axis) could be responsible of these symptoms. We demonstrate that long-term treatment (54 weeks) of adult CD patients with adalimumab (ADA) results in a decrease in serum IGF-1 without changes in serum IGF-1 binding protein (IGF1BP4). These results prompted us to conduct a preclinical study to test the efficiency of IGF-1 in the medication for experimental colitis. IGF-1 treatment of rats with DSS-induced colitis has a beneficial effect on the following circulating biochemical parameters: glucose, albumin, and total protein levels. In this experimental group we also observed healthy maintenance of colon size, body weight, and lean mass in comparison with the DSS-only group. Histological analysis revealed restoration of the mucosal barrier with the IGF-1 treatment, which was characterized by healthy quantities of mucin production, structural maintenance of adherers junctions (AJs), recuperation of E-cadherin and β-catenin levels and decrease in infiltrating immune cells and in metalloproteinase-2 levels. The experimentally induced colitis caused activation of apoptosis markers, including cleaved caspase 3, caspase 8, and PARP and decreases cell-cycle checkpoint activators including phosphorylated Rb, cyclin E, and E2F1.

  Title: Rac1/pSTAT3 expression: A pharmacodynamic marker panel as a first step toward optimization of thiopurine therapy in inflammatory bowel disease patients.
  Abstract: Thiopurine derivatives, such as azathioprine and mercaptopurine, are standard conventional treatment options in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Unfortunately, approximately half of patients discontinue thiopurine therapy within 2 years. To improve the prediction of clinical effectiveness, thiopurine therapy is currently optimized using therapeutic drug monitoring. Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) has been suggested as a potential pharmacodynamic marker of the thiopurine effect in lymphocytes. The active thiopurine metabolite 6-thioguanine triphosphate (6-Thio-GTP) causes T cell apoptosis via Rac1 and the downstream transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). The aim of this study was to develop and validate a functional pharmacodynamic multiparameter flow cytometric assay to determine Rac1/pSTAT3 expression in the various leukocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood in order to predict therapeutic response in IBD patients in the future. Peripheral blood samples of healthy subjects (no fever or clinical complaints of active disease, C-reactive protein < 10 mg/L) were used for immunocytochemical labeling, applying an optimized fixation and permeabilization strategy. A gating procedure was performed to separate all leukocyte subpopulations. Quantitative data were obtained by measuring presence and median fluorescent intensity. In vitro, Rac1 presence and expression were detectable in all leukocyte subpopulations. After IL-6 stimulation, used as proxy for inflammation, a distinct pSTAT3 signal could be detected in T lymphocytes of healthy subjects. In vivo, an upregulated pSTAT3 signal was detected in nearly all IBD patients with active disease and differed substantially from the signal found in IBD patients in remission on thiopurines and healthy subjects. We developed and validated a functional flow cytometric assay to assess Rac1 and pSTAT3 presence and expression. This opens a venue for a pharmacodynamic assay to predict thiopurine effectiveness in IBD patients.© 2021 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.

  Title: Olaparib: A Clinically Applied PARP Inhibitor Protects from Experimental Crohn's Disease and Maintains Barrier Integrity by Improving Bioenergetics through Rescuing Glycolysis in Colonic Epithelial Cells.
  Abstract: Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory disorder of the intestines characterized by epithelial barrier dysfunction and mucosal damage. The activity of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is deeply involved in the pathomechanism of inflammation since it leads to energy depletion and mitochondrial failure in cells. Focusing on the epithelial barrier integrity and bioenergetics of epithelial cells, we investigated whether the clinically applied PARP inhibitor olaparib might improve experimental CD. We used the oral PARP inhibitor olaparib in the 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid- (TNBS-) induced mouse colitis model. Inflammatory scoring, cytokine levels, colon histology, hematological analysis, and intestinal permeability were studied. Caco-2 monolayer culture was utilized as an epithelial barrier model, on which we used qPCR and light microscopy imaging, and measured impedance-based barrier integrity, FITC-dextran permeability, apoptosis, mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate, and extracellular acidification rate. Olaparib reduced the inflammation score, the concentration of IL-1β and IL-6, enhanced the level of IL-10, and decreased the intestinal permeability in TNBS-colitis. Blood cell ratios, such as lymphocyte to monocyte ratio, platelet to lymphocyte ratio, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio were improved. In H2O2-treated Caco-2 monolayer, olaparib decreased morphological changes, barrier permeability, and preserved barrier integrity. In oxidative stress, olaparib enhanced glycolysis (extracellular acidification rate), and it improved mitochondrial function (mitochondrial coupling efficiency, maximal respiration, and spare respiratory capacity) in epithelial cells. Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor used in human cancer therapy, improved experimental CD and protected intestinal barrier integrity by preventing its energetic collapse; therefore, it could be repurposed for the therapy of Crohn's disease.Copyright © 2021 Dominika Kovács et al.

  Title: GPR120 Inhibits Colitis Through Regulation of CD4+ T Cell Interleukin 10 Production.
  Abstract: G protein-coupled receptor (GPR) 120 has been implicated in regulating metabolic syndromes with anti-inflammatory function. However, the role of GPR120 in intestinal inflammation is unknown. Here, we investigated whether and how GPR120 regulates CD4+ T cell function to inhibit colitis development.Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis model, Citrobacter rodentium infection model, and CD4+ T cell adoptive transfer model were used to analyze the role of GPR120 in regulating colitis development. The effect of GPR120 on CD4+ T cell functions was analyzed by RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, and Seahorse metabolic assays. Mice were administered GPR120 agonist for investigating the potential of GPR120 agonist in preventing and treating colitis.Deficiency of GPR120 in CD4+ T cells resulted in more severe colitis in mice upon dextran sodium sulfate insult and enteric infection. Transfer of GPR120-deficient CD4+CD45Rbhi T cells induced more severe colitis in Rag-/- mice with lower intestinal interleukin (IL) 10+CD4+ T cells. Treatment with the GPR120 agonist CpdA promoted CD4+ T cell production of IL10 by up-regulating Blimp1 and enhancing glycolysis, which was regulated by mTOR. GPR120 agonist-treated wild-type, but not IL10-deficient and Blimp1-deficient, T helper 1 cells induced less severe colitis. Furthermore, oral administration of GPR120 agonist protected mice from intestinal inflammation in both prevention and treatment schemes. Gpr120 expression was positively correlated with Il10 expression in the human colonic mucosa, including patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.Our findings show the role of GPR120 in regulating intestinal CD4+ T cell production of IL10 to inhibit colitis development, which identifies GPR120 as a potential therapeutic target for treating inflammatory bowel diseases.Copyright © 2022 AGA Institute.

  Title: Akkermansia muciniphila and its outer protein Amuc_1100 regulates tryptophan metabolism in colitis.
  Abstract: Dietary interventions, including dietary ingredients, nutrients and probiotics, exert anti-inflammatory effects in ulcerative colitis (UC). Our previous study showed that Akkermansia muciniphila (Akk), a promising probiotic, could protect against colitis via the regulation of the immune response. However, whether it can restore aberrant tryptophan (Trp) metabolism during colitis remains unclear. In this study, untargeted serum metabolomics of patients with UC and colitis mice showed that Trp metabolism was activated, which was confirmed by quantification of Trp metabolites from a validation cohort and animal study. Integrative analysis of faecal metagenomes and serum metabolomes revealed significant associations between Akk and three Trp metabolites. Live Akk, pasteurised Akk and Amuc_1100 failed to restore the reduction in Trp metabolites involved in the serotonin pathway in colitis mice. However, live Akk, pasteurised Akk and Amuc_1100 increased kynurenine (Kyn) but decreased 2-picolinic acid (PIC) levels and the PIC/Kyn ratio without regulating any of the genes involved in Trp metabolism, suggesting that they could suppress the Kyn pathway (KP) independent of colon tissue. In addition, they could significantly restore the enrichment of Trp metabolism mediated by faecal microbiota. Specifically, live Akk, pasteurised Akk and Amuc_1100 could significantly offset the reduction in indoleacetic acid (IAA) levels. Pasteurised Akk significantly elevated the serum levels of indole acrylic acid (IA). In addition, live Akk, pasteurised Akk and Amuc_1100 could upregulate aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) targeted genes, including CYP1A1, IL-10 and IL-22, suggesting that Akk could activate AhR signaling by regulating Trp metabolism, thereby attenuating colonic inflammation.

  Title: Endocannabinoid Levels in Ulcerative Colitis Patients Correlate With Clinical Parameters and Are Affected by Cannabis Consumption.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic, idiopathic, inflammatory, gastrointestinal disorders. The endocannabinoid system may have a role in the pathogenesis of IBD. We aimed to assess whether cannabis treatment influences endocannabinoids (eCBs) level and clinical symptoms of IBD patients.Blood samples and biopsies were taken from IBD patients treated by either cannabis or placebo for 8 weeks. Immunohistochemistry for N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine-selective phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) expression was done on colon biopsies, and sample levels of anandamide (AEA), eCB2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG), arachidonic acid (AA), palmitoylethanolamine (PEA), and oleoylethanolamine (OEA) were measured in patient's sera before and after cannabis treatment. Caco-2 cells were cultured with extracts of cannabis with/without tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and their proteins extracted, and Western blotting for NAPE-PLD and FAAH expression was done.Thirteen patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and nine patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) were treated with cannabis. Seventeen patients with CD and 10 with UC served as placebo groups. In all CD patients, the levels of eCBs remained unaltered during the treatment period. In UC patients treated with placebo, but not in those treated with cannabis, the levels of PEA, AEA, and AA decreased significantly. The percent reduction in bowel movements was negatively correlated with changes observed in the circulating AEA and OEA, whereas improvement in quality of life was positively correlated with the levels of 2-AG. In the biopsies from UC patients, FAAH levels increased over the study period. In Caco-2 cells, both cannabis extracts increased NAPE-PLD levels but reduced FAAH expression levels.Our study supports the notion that cannabis use affects eCB "tone" in UC patients and may have beneficial effects on disease symptoms in UC patients.Copyright © 2021 Tartakover Matalon, Azar, Meiri, Hadar, Nemirovski, Abu Jabal, Konikoff, Drucker, Tam and Naftali.

  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is multi-factorial chronic intestinal inflammation driven by pathogenic T cells, among which a large portion of patients are resistant to current anti-inflammatory regimes. The mechanisms underlying colitis pathogenicity and drug resistance are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that RORα is highly expressed in active UC patients, particularly in those non-responsive to anti-TNF treatment. Rorα deficiency in CD4+ T cells greatly reduced colitis development. Mechanistically, RORα regulated T cell infiltration in colon and inhibited T cell apoptosis. Meanwhile, genome-wide occupancy and transcriptome analysis revealed that RORα promoted mTORC1 activation. mTORC1 signaling, also hyperactivated in active UC patients, is necessary for T cell-mediated colitis. Our results thus demonstrate a crucial role of the RORα-mTORC1 axis in CD4+ T cells in promoting IBD, which may be targeted in human patients.Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

  Title: Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency: A Cause of Severe Very-Early-Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Abstract: Mevalonate kinase deficiency should be considered in patients with severe very-early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially in patients with a history of recurrent or chronic fever, peritoneal adhesions, and atypical IBD pathology. Anti-interleukin-1 therapy may be efficacious in these patients with monogenic very-early-onset IBD.© 2021 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

  Title: Relationship Between Thiopurine S-Methyltransferase Genotype/Phenotype and 6-Thioguanine Nucleotide Levels in 316 Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease on 6-Thioguanine.
  Abstract: In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), conventional thiopurine users cease treatment in 60% of cases within 5 years, mostly because of adverse events or nonresponse. In this study, the authors aimed to investigate the role of 6-thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) measurements, geno/phenotyping of thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), and their mutual relationship with TG therapy in IBD.An international retrospective, multicenter cohort study was performed at 4 centers in the Netherlands (Máxima Medical Centre) and the United Kingdom (Guy's and St. Thomas' Hospital, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, and East Surrey Hospital).Overall, 526 6-TGN measurements were performed in 316 patients with IBD. The median daily dosage of TG was 20 mg/d (range 10-40 mg/d), and the median duration of TG use was 21.1 months (SD, 28.0). In total, 129 patients (40.8%) had a known TPMT status. In the variant-type and wild-type TPMT genotype metabolism groups, median 6-TGN values were 1126 [interquartile range (IQR) 948-1562] and 467.5 pmol/8 × 10E8 red blood cells (RBCs) (IQR 334-593). A significant difference was observed between the 2 groups (P = 0.0001, t test). For TPMT phenotypes, in the slow, fast, and normal metabolism groups, the median 6-TGN values were 772.0 (IQR 459-1724), 296.0 (IQR 200-705), and 774.5 pmol/8 × 10E8 RBCs (IQR 500.5-981.5), with a significant difference observed between groups (P < 0.001, analysis of variance).Our findings indicated that TPMT measurements at TG initiation can be useful but are not necessary for daily practice. TPMT genotypes and phenotypes are both associated with significant differences in 6-TGN levels between metabolic groups. However, the advantage of TG remains that RBC 6-TGN measurements are not crucial to monitor treatments in patients with IBD because these measurements did not correlate with laboratory result abnormalities. This presents as a major advantage in countries where patients cannot access these diagnostic tests.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

  Title: Preoperative Serum Vedolizumab Levels Do Not Impact Postoperative Outcomes in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Abstract: Vedolizumab has been proposed to lead to fewer postoperative complications because of its gut specificity. Studies, however, suggest an increased risk of surgical site infections, yet the data are conflicting.This study aimed to assess the effect of vedolizumab drug levels on postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery for IBD.This was a retrospective study of a prospectively maintained database.Patients were operated on by a single surgeon at an academic medical center.A total of 72 patients with IBD undergoing major abdominal surgery were included.Patients were exposed preoperatively to vedolizumab.The primary outcome measured was the postoperative morbidity in patients who had IBD with detectable vs undetectable vedolizumab levels.A total of 72 patients were included in the study. Thirty-eight patients had detectable vedolizumab levels (>1.6 μg/mL), and 34 had undetectable vedolizumab levels. The overall rate of complications was 39%, and ileus was the most common complication. There were no significant differences in clinical variables between the detectable and undetectable vedolizumab level patient groups except for the time between the last dose and surgery (p < 0.01). There were 42 patients in the ulcerative colitis cohort; 48% had an undetectable vedolizumab level and 52% had a detectable vedolizumab level. There were no differences in any postoperative morbidity between ulcerative colitis groups. The Crohn's cohort had 27 patients; 48% had an undetectable vedolizumab levels and 52% had a detectable vedolizumab level. There was a significantly lower incidence of postoperative ileus in patients who had Crohn's disease with detectable vedolizumab levels compared with patients with an undetectable vedolizumab level (p < 0.04).Limitations include a low overall patient population and a high rate of stoma formation.Serum vedolizumab levels do not influence postoperative morbidity in IBD. Vedolizumab may reduce the incidence of postoperative ileus in patients with Crohn's disease.

  Title: Gut-Liver Immune Traffic: Deciphering Immune-Pathogenesis to Underpin Translational Therapy.
  Abstract: The tight relationship between the gut and liver on embryological, anatomical and physiological levels inspired the concept of a gut-liver axis as a central element in the pathogenesis of gut-liver axis diseases. This axis refers to the reciprocal regulation between these two organs causing an integrated system of immune homeostasis or tolerance breakdown guided by the microbiota, the diet, genetic background, and environmental factors. Continuous exposure of gut microbiome, various hormones, drugs and toxins, or metabolites from the diet through the portal vein adapt the liver to maintain its tolerogenic state. This is orchestrated by the combined effort of immune cells network: behaving as a sinusoidal and biliary firewall, along with a regulatory network of immune cells including, regulatory T cells and tolerogenic dendritic cells (DC). In addition, downregulation of costimulatory molecules on hepatic sinusoids, hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells as well as regulating the bile acids chain also play a part in hepatic immune homeostasis. Recent evidence also demonstrated the link between changes in the gut microbiome and liver resident immune cells in the progression of cirrhosis and the tight correlation among primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and also checkpoint induced liver and gut injury. In this review, we will summarize the most recent evidence of the bidirectional relationship among the gut and the liver and how it contributes to liver disease, focusing mainly on PSC and checkpoint induced hepatitis and colitis. We will also focus on completed therapeutic options and on potential targets for future treatment linking with immunology and describe the future direction of this research, taking advantage of modern technologies.Copyright © 2021 Bozward, Ronca, Osei-Bordom and Oo.

  Title: Integrative analysis of ferroptosis-related genes in ulcerative colitis.
  Abstract: The aim of this study was to identify and validate ferroptosis-related markers in ulcerative colitis (UC) to explore new directions for UC diagnosis and treatment.We screened UC chips and ferroptosis-related genes from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), FerrDb, and GeneCards databases. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and ferroptosis-related DEGs between the UC group and normal controls were analyzed using bioinformatics methods. Enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction analysis, and hub genes were screened. Peripheral blood chip and animal experiments were used to validate the ferroptosis-related hub genes. Finally, hub gene-transcription factor, hub gene-microRNA (miRNA), and hub gene-drug interaction networks were constructed.Overall, 26 ferroptosis-related DEGs were identified that were significantly enriched in energy pathways and metabolism. We identified ten ferroptosis-related hub genes from the protein-protein interaction network: IL6, PTGS2, HIF1A, CD44, MUC1, CAV1, NOS2, CXCL2, SCD, and ACSL4. In the peripheral blood chip GSE94648, CD44 and MUC1 were upregulated, which was consistent with the expression trend in GSE75214. Animal experiments showed that CD44 expression was significantly increased in the colon.Our findings indicate that CD44 and MUC1 may be ferroptosis-related markers in UC.

  Title: Inflammation- and Gut-Homing Macrophages, Engineered to De Novo Overexpress Active Vitamin D, Promoted the Regenerative Function of Intestinal Stem Cells.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gut. Available drugs aim to suppress gut inflammation. These drugs have significantly delayed disease progression and improved patients' quality of life. However, the disease continues to progress, underscoring the need to develop novel therapies. Aside from chronic gut inflammation, IBD patients also experience a leaky gut problem due to damage to the intestinal epithelial layer. In this regard, epithelial regeneration and repair are mediated by intestinal stem cells. However, no therapies are available to directly enhance the intestinal stem cells' regenerative and repair function. Recently, it was shown that active vitamin D, i.e., 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D or 1,25(OH)2D, was necessary to maintain Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells, actively cycling under physiological conditions. In this study, we used two strategies to investigate the role of 1,25(OH)2D in intestinal stem cells' regenerative function. First, to avoid the side effects of systemic high 1,25(OH)2D conditions, we used our recently developed novel strategy to deliver locally high 1,25(OH)2D concentrations specifically to inflamed intestines. Second, because of the Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells' active cycling status, we used a pulse-and-chase strategy via 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling to trace the Lgr5+ stem cells through the whole epithelial regeneration process. Our data showed that locally high 1,25(OH)2D concentrations enhanced intestinal stem cell migration. Additionally, the migrated cells differentiated into mature epithelial cells. Our data, therefore, suggest that local delivery of high 1,25(OH)2D concentrations is a promising strategy to augment intestinal epithelial repair in IBD patients.

First, to avoid the side effects of systemic high 1,25(OH)2D conditions, we used our recently developed novel strategy to deliver locally high 1,25(OH)2D concentrations specifically to inflamed intestines. Second, because of the Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells' active cycling status, we used a pulse-and-chase strategy via 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling to trace the Lgr5+ stem cells through the whole epithelial regeneration process. Our data showed that locally high 1,25(OH)2D concentrations enhanced intestinal stem cell migration. Additionally, the migrated cells differentiated into mature epithelial cells. Our data, therefore, suggest that local delivery of high 1,25(OH)2D concentrations is a promising strategy to augment intestinal epithelial repair in IBD patients.

  Title: Microbiota metabolite butyrate constrains neutrophil functions and ameliorates mucosal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease.
  Abstract: Host-microbial cross-talk plays a crucial role in maintenance of gut homeostasis. However, how microbiota-derived metabolites, e.g., butyrate, regulate functions of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains elusive. We sought to investigate the effects of butyrate on IBD neutrophils and elucidate the therapeutic potential in regulating mucosal inflammation. Peripheral neutrophils were isolated from IBD patients and healthy donors, and profiles of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were determined by qRT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. The migration and release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were studied by a Transwell model and immunofluorescence, respectively. The in vivo role of butyrate in regulating IBD neutrophils was evaluated in a DSS-induced colitis model in mice. We found that butyrate significantly inhibited IBD neutrophils to produce proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and calprotectins. Blockade of GPCR signaling with pertussis toxin (PTX) did not interfere the effects whereas pan-histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA) effectively mimicked the role of butyrate. Furthermore, in vitro studies confirmed that butyrate suppressed neutrophil migration and formation of NETs from both CD and UC patients. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that the immunomodulatory effects of butyrate on IBD neutrophils were involved in leukocyte activation, regulation of innate immune response and response to oxidative stress. Consistently, oral administration of butyrate markedly ameliorated mucosal inflammation in DSS-induced murine colitis through inhibition of neutrophil-associated immune responses such as proinflammatory mediators and NET formation. Our data thus reveal that butyrate constrains neutrophil functions and may serve as a novel therapeutic potential in the treatment of IBD.

  Title: The potent and selective RIPK2 inhibitor BI 706039 improves intestinal inflammation in the TRUC mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease.
  Abstract: Mouse and human data implicate the NOD1 and NOD2 sensors of the intestinal microbiome and the associated signal transduction via the receptor interacting protein kinase 2 (RIPK2) as a potential key signaling node for the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and an attractive target for pharmacological intervention. The TRUC mouse model of IBD was strongly indicated for evaluating RIPK2 antagonism for its effect on intestinal inflammation based on previous knockout studies with NOD1, NOD2, and RIPK2. We identified and profiled the BI 706039 molecule as a potent and specific functional inhibitor of both human and mouse RIPK2 and with favorable pharmacokinetic properties. We dosed BI 706039 in the spontaneous TRUC mouse model from age 28 to 56 days. Oral, daily administration of BI 706039 caused dose-responsive and significant improvement in colonic histopathological inflammation, colon weight, and terminal levels of protein-normalized fecal lipocalin (all P values <0.001). These observations correlated with dose responsively increasing systemic levels of the BI 706039 compound, splenic molecular target engagement of RIPK2, and modulation of inflammatory genes in the colon. This demonstrates that a relatively low oral dose of a potent and selective RIPK2 inhibitor can modulate signaling in the intestinal immune system and significantly improve disease associated intestinal inflammation.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The RIPK2 kinase at the apex of microbiome immunosensing is an attractive target for pharmacological intervention. A low oral dose of a RIPK2 inhibitor leads to significantly improved intestinal inflammation in the murine TRUC model of colitis. A selective and potent inhibitor of the RIPK2 kinase may represent a new class of therapeutics that target microbiome-driven signaling for the treatment of IBD.

  Title: Schistosoma japonicum peptide SJMHE1 inhibits acute and chronic colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium in mice.
  Abstract: Harnessing helminth-based immunoregulation is a novel therapeutic strategy for many immune dysfunction disorders, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). We previously identified a small molecule peptide from Schistosoma japonicum and named it SJMHE1. SJMHE1 can suppress delayed-type hypersensitivity, collagen-induced arthritis and asthma in mice. In this study, we assessed the effects of SJMHE1 on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced acute and chronic colitis.Acute and chronic colitis were induced in C57BL/6 mice by DSS, following which the mice were injected with an emulsifier SJMHE1 or phosphate-buffered saline. The mice were then examined for body weight loss, disease activity index, colon length, histopathological changes, cytokine expression and helper T (Th) cell subset distribution.SJMHE1 treatment significantly suppressed DSS-induced acute and chronic colitis, improved disease activity and pathological damage to the colon and modulated the expression of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in splenocytes and the colon. In addition, SJMHE1 treatment reduced the percentage of Th1 and Th17 cells and increased the percentage of Th2 and regulatory T (Treg) cells in the splenocytes and mesenteric lymph nodes of mice with acute colitis. Similarly, SJMHE1 treatment upregulated the expression of interleukin-10 (IL-10) mRNA, downregulated the expression of IL-17 mRNA and modulated the Th cell balance in mice with chronic colitis.Our data show that SJMHE1 provided protection against acute and chronic colitis by restoring the immune balance. As a small molecule, SJMHE1 might be a novel agent for the treatment of IBDs without immunogenicity concerns.© 2021. The Author(s).

  Title: Infliximab Concentrations during Induction Are Predictive for Endoscopic Remission in Pediatric Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease under Combination Therapy.
  Abstract: To study infliximab (IFX) pharmacokinetics in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) during induction therapy to predict outcome and explore if other covariates influenced outcome.All children with IBD starting IFX therapy (5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, 6, and 12) for active luminal disease from May 2017 to May 2019 were included and followed prospectively. Patients were sampled at multiple timepoints during induction (trough concentrations and peak concentration at weeks 0, 2, 6, and 12, and intermediate concentration at weeks 1-4). IFX concentrations and cumulative drug exposure were correlated with outcome at 6 months. Endoscopic remission was defined as Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease of <3 or Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0, and deep remission as endoscopic with clinical remission (Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index/Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index of <10).There were 252 serum induction concentrations obtained from 32 patients (81% on concomitant thiopurines). Children in endoscopic remission (all in deep remission) at 6 months had significantly higher drug concentrations from week 4 onward. A receiver operating characteristics curve analysis identified IFX trough concentrations at week 12 of ≥5.0 μg/mL and area under the curve at weeks 0-12 of ≥4056.0 μg∗day/mL as the minimal target to achieve endoscopic remission at 6 months (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.796 [95% CI, 0.62-0.97] and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.778 [95% CI, 0.61-0.94], respectively). In addition, our findings suggest that proteomic analysis may help to understand IFX response.Higher IFX exposure during induction therapy in pediatric patients with IBD is associated with significantly better endoscopic and deep remission rates at 6 months. Drug concentrations differentiate remitters from nonremitters from week 4 after induction onward.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

  Title: Dual targeting of lymphocyte homing and retention through α4β7 and αEβ7 inhibition in inflammatory bowel disease.
  Abstract: Anti-integrins are therapeutically effective for inflammatory bowel disease, yet the relative contribution of α4β7 and αEβ7 to gut lymphocyte trafficking is not fully elucidated. Here, we evaluate the effect of α4β7 and αEβ7 blockade using a combination of murine models of gut trafficking and longitudinal gene expression analysis in etrolizumab-treated patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Dual blockade of α4β7 and αEβ7 reduces CD8+ T cell accumulation in the gut to a greater extent than blockade of either integrin alone. Anti-αEβ7 reduces epithelial:T cell interactions and promotes egress of activated T cells from the mucosa into lymphatics. Inflammatory gene expression is greater in human intestinal αEβ7+ T cells. Etrolizumab-treated patients with CD display a treatment-specific reduction in inflammatory and cytotoxic intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) genes. Concurrent blockade of α4β7 and αEβ7 promotes reduction of cytotoxic IELs and inflammatory T cells in the gut mucosa through a stepwise inhibition of intestinal tissue entry and retention.© 2021 The Authors.

  Title: Antibacterial and Immunosuppressive Effects of OPS-2071, a Candidate Therapy for Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Although many types of drug are used, clinical outcomes are still unsatisfactory. Previous studies have suggested that intestinal bacteria are involved in the pathogenesis of IBD. Accordingly, in an IBD model we evaluated the therapeutic effects of OPS-2071, a low-absorption quinolone antibacterial agent indicated for intestinal infection, and investigated its mechanism of action.The therapeutic effects of OPS-2071 and comparison therapies were evaluated using naive CD4 + T cell-transfer IBD model mice. In vitro inhibition of LPS-induced TNF-α production and inhibitory effects on T cell responses stimulated using anti-CD3/CD28 antibody-loaded beads were evaluated using mouse splenocytes and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In addition, in vitro activities against bacteria implicated in IBD pathogenesis were tested.OPS-2071 dose-dependently decreased both colonic weight/length ratio and the colitis histological score as compared with the vehicle group. The therapeutic effect of OPS-2071 was equivalent to that of anti-IL-12/23 (p40) antibody. In vitro, OPS-2071 suppressed TNF-α production induced by LPS stimulation and T cell responses in a dose-dependent manner. At high concentrations, these effects were comparable to those of existing immunosuppressive agents, such as prednisolone, in both mouse and human cells. OPS-2071 also showed antibacterial activity against IBD-related bacteria.Our results suggest that OPS-2071 had both immunosuppressive and antibacterial effects. This dual effect makes OPS-2071 a unique and promising candidate for IBD.© 2021. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

  Title: Antibacterial and Immunosuppressive Effects of OPS-2071, a Candidate Therapy for Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Although many types of drug are used, clinical outcomes are still unsatisfactory. Previous studies have suggested that intestinal bacteria are involved in the pathogenesis of IBD. Accordingly, in an IBD model we evaluated the therapeutic effects of OPS-2071, a low-absorption quinolone antibacterial agent indicated for intestinal infection, and investigated its mechanism of action.The therapeutic effects of OPS-2071 and comparison therapies were evaluated using naive CD4 + T cell-transfer IBD model mice. In vitro inhibition of LPS-induced TNF-α production and inhibitory effects on T cell responses stimulated using anti-CD3/CD28 antibody-loaded beads were evaluated using mouse splenocytes and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In addition, in vitro activities against bacteria implicated in IBD pathogenesis were tested.OPS-2071 dose-dependently decreased both colonic weight/length ratio and the colitis histological score as compared with the vehicle group. The therapeutic effect of OPS-2071 was equivalent to that of anti-IL-12/23 (p40) antibody. In vitro, OPS-2071 suppressed TNF-α production induced by LPS stimulation and T cell responses in a dose-dependent manner. At high concentrations, these effects were comparable to those of existing immunosuppressive agents, such as prednisolone, in both mouse and human cells. OPS-2071 also showed antibacterial activity against IBD-related bacteria.Our results suggest that OPS-2071 had both immunosuppressive and antibacterial effects. This dual effect makes OPS-2071 a unique and promising candidate for IBD.© 2021. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

  Title: Residual homing of α4β7-expressing β1+PI16+ regulatory T cells with potent suppressive activity correlates with exposure-efficacy of vedolizumab.
  Abstract: The anti-α4β7 integrin antibody vedolizumab is administered at a fixed dose for the treatment of IBDs. This leads to a wide range of serum concentrations in patients and previous studies had suggested that highest exposure levels are associated with suboptimal clinical response. We aimed to determine the mechanisms underlying these non-linear exposure-efficacy characteristics of vedolizumab.We characterised over 500 samples from more than 300 subjects. We studied the binding of vedolizumab to T cells and investigated the functional consequences for dynamic adhesion, transmigration, gut homing and free binding sites in vivo. Employing single-cell RNA sequencing, we characterised α4β7 integrin-expressing T cell populations 'resistant' to vedolizumab and validated our findings in vitro and in samples from vedolizumab-treated patients with IBD. We also correlated our findings with a post-hoc analysis of the Gemini II and III studies.Regulatory T (TReg) cells exhibited a right-shifted vedolizumab binding profile compared with effector T (TEff) cells. Consistently, in a certain concentration range, the residual adhesion, transmigration, homing of and availability of functional α4β7 on TReg cells in vivo was higher than that of/on TEff cells. We identified a vedolizumab-'resistant' α4β7-expressing β1+PI16+ TReg cell subset with pronounced regulatory properties as the substrate for this effect. Our observations correlated with exposure-efficacy data from Gemini II and III trials.Completely blocking TEff cell trafficking with vedolizumab, while simultaneously permitting residual homing of powerful TReg cells in an optimal 'therapeutic window' based on target exposure levels might be a strategy to optimise treatment outcomes in patients with IBD.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

  Title: Anti-tumour necrosis factor α antibodies and circulating lymphocyte phenotypes in inflammatory bowel disease.
  Abstract: Circulating lymphocyte subtypes are not fully explored parameters for monitoring chronic T cell activation during inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), one of the main mediators of IBD related inflammation induces expression of CD70 on T cells. CD70 limits T cell expansion and controls CD27 receptor on activated B lymphocytes. Aim of this study was to assess the number and the frequency of CD70+ T cells and CD27+ B cells in IBD patients during inactive phase of the disease under or without anti-TNFα treatment.We studied 91 patients with inactive IBD, 31 untreated, 29 treated with infliximab (IFX), and 31 treated with adalimumab (ADA). Lymphocyte phenotypes were assessed by flow cytometry using anti-CD45, CD19, CD27, CD3, and CD70 monoclonal antibodies. IFX and ADA actual capacity of TNFα neutralization in serum was estimated by the recoveryELISA technique.Whereas CD3+ T cells were increased in treated compared to untreated patients, the percentage of the CD70+ T cells was significantly lower in treated patients indicating a 'cooling' effect of the biological therapy. This effect differs between samples according to the therapeutic range of the circulating drug. Although the CD19+ B-cell percentage tended to be lower in treated patients, CD19+27+ memory B cells did not show significant differences between groups.Frequency of peripheral blood CD70+ T cells was significantly reduced by treatment with anti-TNFα antibodies. Monitoring of this parameter of T cells can give better insight to the disease progression and therapy application in IBD patients.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

  Title: Pathogenesis of Musculoskeletal Deficits in Children and Adults with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Abstract: Musculoskeletal deficits are among the most commonly reported extra-intestinal manifestations and complications of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially in those with Crohn's disease. The adverse effects of IBD on bone and muscle are multifactorial, including the direct effects of underlying inflammatory disease processes, nutritional deficits, and therapeutic effects. These factors also indirectly impact bone and muscle by interfering with regulatory pathways. Resultantly, individuals with IBD are at increased risk of osteoporosis and sarcopenia and associated musculoskeletal morbidity. In paediatric IBD, these factors may contribute to suboptimal bone and muscle accrual. This review evaluates the main pathogenic factors associated with musculoskeletal deficits in children and adults with IBD and summarises the current literature and understanding of the musculoskeletal phenotype in these patients.

  Title: Antitumor Necrosis Factor-like Ligand 1A Therapy Targets Tissue Inflammation and Fibrosis Pathways and Reduces Gut Pathobionts in Ulcerative Colitis.
  Abstract: The first-in-class treatment PF-06480605 targets the tumor necrosis factor-like ligand 1A (TL1A) molecule in humans. Results from the phase 2a TUSCANY trial highlighted the safety and efficacy of PF-06480605 in ulcerative colitis. Preclinical and in vitro models have identified a role for TL1A in both innate and adaptive immune responses, but the mechanisms underlying the efficacy of anti-TL1A treatment in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are not known.Here, we provide analysis of tissue transcriptomic, peripheral blood proteomic, and fecal metagenomic data from the recently completed phase 2a TUSCANY trial and demonstrate endoscopic improvement post-treatment with PF-06480605 in participants with ulcerative colitis.Our results revealed robust TL1A target engagement in colonic tissue and a distinct colonic transcriptional response reflecting a reduction in inflammatory T helper 17 cell, macrophage, and fibrosis pathways in patients with endoscopic improvement. Proteomic analysis of peripheral blood revealed a corresponding decrease in inflammatory T-cell cytokines. Finally, microbiome analysis showed significant changes in IBD-associated pathobionts, Streptococcus salivarius, S. parasanguinis, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae post-therapy.The ability of PF-06480605 to engage and inhibit colonic TL1A, targeting inflammatory T cell and fibrosis pathways, provides the first-in-human mechanistic data to guide anti-TL1A therapy for the treatment of IBD.© 2021 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

  Title: IgA vasculitis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: new insights into the role of TNF-α blockers.
  Abstract: The association of IgA vasculitis (IgAV) and IBD is rarely described, mainly during anti-TNF-α therapy. We aimed to describe the association of IgAV and IBD.We retrospectively analysed the association of IgAV and IBD through the implication of the GETAID and FVSG networks. Characteristics of IBD and IgAV were collected using a standardized case report form.Forty-three cases were included. IBD [mainly Crohn's disease (CD) in 58%] preceded IgAV in 38 (88%), with median interval of 9.2 (IQR 5.4-15.4) years. In these 38 patients, at IgAV diagnosis, five (13%) had active IBD and 28 (74%) were treated with anti-TNF-α for a median duration of 31.5 (IQR 19-56) months. Main IgAV manifestations were purpura all patients (100%), joints in 20/35 (57%), renal in 15/35 (43%) and gastrointestinal in 11/35 (31%) involvement. IgAV was treated with glucocorticoids in 25 (66%), colchicine in six (16%), CYC in six (16%) and anti-TNF-α were discontinued in 15/28 (54%). No IgAV relapse occurred when TNF-α blockers were stopped, vs 23% in patients pursuing it. Conversely, five (33%) had IBD flare or complication after anti-TNF-α cessation vs one (8%) in those continuing biologics. Anti-TNF-α were resumed in six (40%), with subsequent IgAV relapse in four (67%).This large cohort suggests that TNF-α blockers may promote the onset of IgAV in IBD. Discontinuation of anti-TNF-α was associated with vasculitis remission but increased risk of IBD relapses, whereas continuation of anti-TNF-α was associated with IBD remission but vasculitis relapse.© The Author(s) 2021.

  Title: TPMT and NUDT15 polymorphisms in thiopurine induced leucopenia in inflammatory bowel disease: a prospective study from India.
  Abstract: Polymorphisms in thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and Nudix hydrolase-15 (NUDT15) have been implicated as the predominant cause of thiopurine induced leukopenia in the Western countries and East Asia respectively. Exact role of these polymorphisms in South Asian population with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is uncertain.We included consecutive patients with IBD who were initiated on thiopurines at a center in North India. The dosage of thiopurines was titrated using regular monitoring of hemogram and liver function tests. Three TPMT polymorphisms (c.238 G > C, c.460 G > A, and c.719A > G) and one NUDT15 polymorphism (c.415 C > T) were assessed. Comparison regarding incidence of leukopenia and maximum tolerated thiopurine dosage was performed between those with wild polymorphism and those with TPMT and NUDT15 polymorphisms, respectively.Of the 119 patients (61 males, mean age 36.8 ± 13.5 years), 105 (88.2%) had ulcerative colitis and 14 (11.8%) had Crohn's disease. Leukopenia was noted in 33 (27.7%), gastrointestinal intolerance in 5 (4.2%) and pancreatitis in 2 (1.6%). TPMT polymorphisms were detected amongst five patients of whom 1 developed leukopenia. NUDT15 polymorphism was noted in 13 patients of whom 7 had leukopenia. The odds of developing leukopenia in TPMT polymorphism were non-significant (0.77, 95% CI:0.0822 to 7.2134, P = 0.819) but were significantly higher in those with NUDT15 polymorphism (3.5933, 1.1041 to 11.6951, P value: = 0.0336).NUDT15 polymorphism was more frequent than TPMT polymorphisms and was associated with thiopurine induced leukopenia. However, the tested polymorphisms account for only 24.2% of the risk of thiopurine induced leukopenia.© 2021. The Author(s).

  Title: TPMT and NUDT15 polymorphisms in thiopurine induced leucopenia in inflammatory bowel disease: a prospective study from India.
  Abstract: Polymorphisms in thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and Nudix hydrolase-15 (NUDT15) have been implicated as the predominant cause of thiopurine induced leukopenia in the Western countries and East Asia respectively. Exact role of these polymorphisms in South Asian population with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is uncertain.We included consecutive patients with IBD who were initiated on thiopurines at a center in North India. The dosage of thiopurines was titrated using regular monitoring of hemogram and liver function tests. Three TPMT polymorphisms (c.238 G > C, c.460 G > A, and c.719A > G) and one NUDT15 polymorphism (c.415 C > T) were assessed. Comparison regarding incidence of leukopenia and maximum tolerated thiopurine dosage was performed between those with wild polymorphism and those with TPMT and NUDT15 polymorphisms, respectively.Of the 119 patients (61 males, mean age 36.8 ± 13.5 years), 105 (88.2%) had ulcerative colitis and 14 (11.8%) had Crohn's disease. Leukopenia was noted in 33 (27.7%), gastrointestinal intolerance in 5 (4.2%) and pancreatitis in 2 (1.6%). TPMT polymorphisms were detected amongst five patients of whom 1 developed leukopenia. NUDT15 polymorphism was noted in 13 patients of whom 7 had leukopenia. The odds of developing leukopenia in TPMT polymorphism were non-significant (0.77, 95% CI:0.0822 to 7.2134, P = 0.819) but were significantly higher in those with NUDT15 polymorphism (3.5933, 1.1041 to 11.6951, P value: = 0.0336).NUDT15 polymorphism was more frequent than TPMT polymorphisms and was associated with thiopurine induced leukopenia. However, the tested polymorphisms account for only 24.2% of the risk of thiopurine induced leukopenia.© 2021. The Author(s).

  Title: Chemical Modulators of Mucosal Associated Invariant T Cells.
  Abstract: Over the past decade, we have contributed to the chemistry of microbial natural products and synthetic ligands, related to riboflavin and uracils, that modulate immune cells called mucosal associated invariant T cells (MAIT cells). These highly abundant T lymphocytes were only discovered in 2003 and have become recognized for their importance in mammalian immunology. Unlike other T cells, MAIT cells are not activated by peptide or lipid antigens. In collaboration with immunology and structural biology research groups, we discovered that they are instead activated by unstable nitrogen-containing heterocycles synthesized by bacteria. The most potent naturally occurring activating compound (antigen) is 5-(2-oxopropylideneamino)-d-ribitylaminouracil (5-OP-RU). This compound is an imine (Schiff base) formed through condensation between an intermediate in the biosynthesis of riboflavin (vitamin B2) and a metabolic byproduct of mammalian and microbial glycolysis. Although it is very unstable in water due to intramolecular ring closure or hydrolysis, we were able to develop a non-enzymatic synthesis that yields a pure kinetically stable compound in a nonaqueous solvent. This compound has revolutionized the study of MAIT cell immunology due to its potent activation (EC50 = 2 pM) of MAIT cells and its development into immunological reagents for detecting and characterizing MAIT cells in tissues. MAIT cells are now linked to key physiological processes and disease, including antibacterial defense, tissue repair, regulation of graft-vs-host disease, gastritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and cancer. 5-OP-RU activates MAIT cells and, like a vaccine, has been shown to protect mice from bacterial infections and cancers. Mechanistic studies on the binding of 5-OP-RU to its dual protein targets, the major histocompatibility complex class I related protein (MR1) and the MAIT cell receptor (MAIT TCR), have involved synthetic chemistry, 2D 1H NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, computer modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, biochemical, cellular, and immunological assays, and protein structural biology. These combined studies have revealed structural influences for 5-OP-RU in solution on protein binding and antigen presentation and potency; informed the development of potent (EC50 = 2 nM) and water stable analogues; led to fluorescent analogues for detecting and tracking binding proteins in and on cells; and enabled discovery of drugs and drug-like molecules that bind MR1 and modulate MAIT cell function. MAIT cells offer new opportunities for chemical synthesis to enhance the stability, potency, selectivity, and bioavailability of small molecule ligands for MR1 or MAIT TCR proteins, and to contribute to the understanding of T cell immunity and the development of prospective new immunomodulating medicines.

  Title: Differences in the placental pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab and ustekinumab during pregnancy in women with inflammatory bowel disease: a prospective multicentre study.
  Abstract: Vedolizumab demonstrated different placental pharmacokinetics than other immunoglobulin G1 antibodies, leading to lower drug levels in cord blood in contrast to maternal blood at the time of delivery. The placental transfer of ustekinumab seems to have a pattern similar to anti-tumour necrosis factor agents. Current evidence on the placental pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab and ustekinumab is limited. We aimed to assess the placental transfer of ustekinumab and vedolizumab in pregnant patients with inflammatory bowel disease.Consecutive women from a prospective observational study who were exposed to ustekinumab or vedolizumab within 2 months prior to conception or during pregnancy were included. Ustekinumab and vedolizumab levels were measured in maternal and cord blood at the time of delivery.Drug levels were available in 31 infant-mother pairs (15 exposed to ustekinumab and 16 to vedolizumab). The median maternal and newborn ustekinumab levels were 5.3 mg/l and 10.3 mg/l, respectively (the median infant-to-maternal ratio was 1.7), while the median maternal and cord vedolizumab levels were 7.3 mg/l and 4.5 mg/l (the median infant-to-maternal ratio was 0.66). The ustekinumab levels in cord blood positively correlated with the maternal levels at delivery (ρ = 0.751, p = 0.001). However, no correlation with the timing of the last drug administration was found. In contrast, the vedolizumab levels in cord blood demonstrated significant positive correlation with the maternal levels (ρ = 0.831, p < 0.001) along with the gestational week of the last infusion (ρ = 0.736, p = 0.001).Vedolizumab demonstrated different placental pharmacokinetics, leading to lower drug levels in cord blood compared to maternal blood at delivery; in contrast, the placental transfer of ustekinumab seems to have a pattern similar to anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents.© The Author(s), 2021.

  Title: Pyogenic Spondylitis Caused by Staphylococcus schleiferi in a Patient with Crohn's Disease.
  Abstract: Staphylococcus schleiferi has rarely been reported to cause pyogenic spondylitis. A 42-year-old man had been treated for Crohn's disease with immunosuppressive agents and home parenteral nutrition via a central vein (CV) port. The patient was admitted to our hospital, presenting with neck pain and a fever. A neurological examination showed slight weakness in his left-hand muscles, and he was diagnosed with pyogenic spondylitis of C6 and C7 vertebral bodies due to catheter-related blood stream infection caused by S. schleiferi. An early diagnosis by magnetic resonance imaging, CV port removal and antibiotic therapy targeting S. schleiferi improved his symptoms.

  Title: Regular Use of Proton Pump Inhibitor and the Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Pooled Analysis of 3 Prospective Cohorts.
  Abstract: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have a major impact on gut microbiome and immune function, which in turn, may increase the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our aim in this study was to evaluate PPI use and subsequent risk of IBD and subtypes (ie, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis).This was a pooled analysis of the Nurses' Health Study (NHS, n = 82,869), NHS II (n = 95,141), and UK Biobank (n = 469,397). We included participants with information on personal use of PPIs and free of IBD or cancer at baseline. We evaluated hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with Cox regression adjusting for lifestyle factors, PPI indications, comorbidities, and other medications.We documented 271 cases of IBD (median follow-up, 12 years) in the pooled NHS cohorts and 1419 cases (median follow-up, 8.1 years) in the UK Biobank. For both pooled NHS cohorts and UK Biobank, regular use of PPIs consistently showed a significantly positive association with IBD, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis risk. Combined analyses of 3 cohorts showed that regular PPI users had an increased risk of IBD as compared with nonusers (hazard ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.22-1.65; number needed to harm, 3770; 95% CI, 3668-4369). Direct comparison with H2 receptor antagonist, a less potent acid suppressor, showed that PPI use was also associated with higher IBD risk (hazard ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.16-1.65).Regular use of PPIs was associated with an increased risk of IBD and its subtypes. The findings should be interpreted with caution because the absolute risk was low and the clinical benefits of PPIs are substantial.Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

  Title: Drug Levels Associated With Optimal Discrimination Between Remission and Nonremission and Comparison of Antibody Assays During First Year of Stable Infliximab Maintenance Therapy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Abstract: To implement therapeutic drug monitoring-based strategies for infliximab (IFX) in inflammatory bowel disease, the authors assessed IFX levels for optimal discrimination between remission and nonremission and compared assays for anti-IFX antibodies (Abs).The retrospective cohort comprised 163 bionaive patients with inflammatory bowel disease who received stable IFX maintenance therapy (5 mg/kg every 8 weeks [q8w]) for 1 year. The clinical and biochemical remission status was assessed at all infusions (weeks 14-22-30-38-46-54), and IFX and anti-IFX Abs were estimated using a time-resolved fluorometric assay (n = 690; 88% of infusions). Samples positive for anti-IFX Abs or IFX levels < limit of detection (n = 102) were analyzed by 2 binding assays [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)] and functional reporter gene assay/drug-tolerant enzyme immunoassay.At all assessed time points, IFX levels were more than double in patients presenting clinical or biochemical remission. An IFX concentration of 4.5 mcg/mL was associated with clinical remission during the entire first year of therapy [sensitivity 54% (49-59), specificity 73% (67-78), AUCROC 0.65 (0.60-0.69), P < 0.0001]; these values were comparable with biochemical remission. Exploratory assessments for endoscopic remission (n = 131) were performed at the discretion of the treating physician. Anti-IFX Abs were associated with undetectable IFX and treatment failure [OR 2.9 (1.4-6.0), P < 0.01], irrespective of persistency or transiency. All performed assays detected anti-IFX Abs were picked up by all assays in ∼2/3 of samples. Binding assays demonstrated a higher sensitivity to anti-IFX Abs.IFX at ∼5 mcg/mL was associated with clinical and biochemical remission during the first year of maintenance therapy. During this phase of therapy, standard binding assays are appropriate for therapeutic drug monitoring.Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

An IFX concentration of 4.5 mcg/mL was associated with clinical remission during the entire first year of therapy [sensitivity 54% (49-59), specificity 73% (67-78), AUCROC 0.65 (0.60-0.69), P < 0.0001]; these values were comparable with biochemical remission. Exploratory assessments for endoscopic remission (n = 131) were performed at the discretion of the treating physician. Anti-IFX Abs were associated with undetectable IFX and treatment failure [OR 2.9 (1.4-6.0), P < 0.01], irrespective of persistency or transiency. All performed assays detected anti-IFX Abs were picked up by all assays in ∼2/3 of samples. Binding assays demonstrated a higher sensitivity to anti-IFX Abs.IFX at ∼5 mcg/mL was associated with clinical and biochemical remission during the first year of maintenance therapy. During this phase of therapy, standard binding assays are appropriate for therapeutic drug monitoring.Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

  Title: Milk-derived extracellular vesicles alleviate ulcerative colitis by regulating the gut immunity and reshaping the gut microbiota.
  Abstract: Rationale: Bovine milk constitutes an essential part of human diet, especially for children, due to its enrichment of various nutrients. We recently developed an effective protocol for the isolation of extracellular vesicles from milk (mEVs) and discovered that mEVs contained large amounts of immune-active proteins and modulated the gut immunity and microbiota in healthy mice. Here, we aimed to explore the therapeutic effects of mEVs on inflammatory bowel disease. Methods: MicroRNAs and protein content in mEVs were analyzed by RNA sequencing and proteomics, respectively, followed by functional annotation. Ulcerative colitis (UC) was induced by feeding mice with dextran sulfate sodium. Intestinal immune cell populations were phenotyped by flow cytometry, and the gut microbiota was analyzed via 16S rRNA sequencing. Results: We showed that abundant proteins and microRNAs in mEVs were involved in the regulation of immune and inflammatory pathways and that oral administration of mEVs prevented colon shortening, reduced intestinal epithelium disruption, inhibited infiltration of inflammatory cells and tissue fibrosis in a mouse UC model. Mechanistically, mEVs attenuated inflammatory response via inhibiting TLR4-NF-κB signaling pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Furthermore, mEVs were able to correct cytokine production disorder and restore the balance between T helper type 17 (Th17) cells and interleukin-10+Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells in the inflamed colon. The disturbed gut microbiota in UC was also partially recovered upon treatment with mEVs. The correlation between the gut microbiota and cytokines suggests that mEVs may modulate intestinal immunity via influencing the gut microbiota. Conclusions: These findings reveal that mEVs alleviate colitis by regulating intestinal immune homeostasis via inhibiting TLR4-NF-κB and NLRP3 signaling pathways, restoring Treg/Th17 cell balance, and reshaping the gut microbiota.© The author(s).

  Title: A Novel Model Based on Serum Biomarkers to Predict Primary Non-Response to Infliximab in Crohn's Disease.
  Abstract: Infliximab is effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with Crohn's disease (CD), but primary non-response (PNR) occurs in 10-30% of cases. We investigated whether serum biomarkers are effective in predicting PNR in patients with CD.From January 2016 to April 2020, a total of 260 patients were recruited to this prospective and retrospective cohort study. Serum samples were collected at baseline and week 2 of infliximab treatment. Serum levels of 35 cytokines were assessed in 18 patients from the discovery cohort and were further evaluated in the 60-patient cohort 1. Then, candidate cytokines and other serological biomarkers were used to construct a predictive model by logistic regression in a 182-patient cohort 2. PNR was defined based on the change of CD activity index or clinical symptoms.Among the 35 cytokines, matrix metalloproteinase 3(MMP3) and C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) were two effective serum biomarkers associated with PNR in both the discovery cohort and cohort 1. In cohort 2, serum level of MMP3, CCL2 and C-reactive protein (CRP) at 2 weeks after infliximab injection were independent predictors of PNR, with odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of 1.108(1.059-1.159), 0.940(0.920-0.965) and 1.102(1.031-1.117), respectively. A PNR classifier combining these three indicators had a large area under the curve [0.896(95% CI:0.895-0.897)] and negative predictive value [0.918(95%CI:0.917-0.919)] to predict PNR to infliximab.MMP3, CCL2, and CRP are promising biomarkers in prediction of PNR to infliximab, and PNR classifier could accurately predict PNR and may be useful in clinical practice for therapy selection.Copyright © 2021 Li, Chen, Zhang, Zhou, Chen, Zeng, Chen and Zhang.

  Title: An Escherichia coli strain with extra catalase activity protects against murine colitis by scavenging hydrogen peroxide and regulating regulatory t cell/interleukin-17 pathways.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract whose occurrence is attributed to various factors, including genetic factors, immune response, microbial changes, and oxidative stress. Microbial-targeted therapy has emerged as an alternative to immunosuppressive therapy for IBD.The effects of an atypical commensal Escherichia coli strain harboring an additional catalase gene (compared to typical E. coli strain) on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis were explored in mice.The atypical E. coli (atEc) significantly restored body weight, reduced disease activity score, and improved histological scores in mice with colitis. Hydrogen peroxide levels in colitis mice were noticeably decreased when the mice were administered atEc. The proinflammatory cytokine levels were decreased and regulatory T cell numbers were increased after the administration of atEc. The abundance of Firmicutes was significantly recovered, while that of Proteobacteria decreased in atEc -treated mice compared with that in vehicle-treated wild-type mice. To investigate the role of interleukin (IL)-17A in mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of the atEc, IL-17A‒knockout mice were orally administered atEc. Clinical and immune responses and microbial composition were significantly reduced in IL-17A‒knockout mice compared with those in wild-type mice.atEc ameliorates colonic inflammation by controlling hydrogen peroxide levels, immune responses (including regulatory T cells and IL-17A), and microbial composition. atEc could be a novel candidate of probiotic for IBD treatment.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

  Title: Ustekinumab Improves Active Crohn's Disease by Suppressing the T Helper 17 Pathway.
  Abstract: Ustekinumab (UST), an antibody targeting the p40 subunit of interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23, is effective in treating Crohn's disease (CD). To clarify the mechanism of UST, we investigated T-cell differentiation in CD patients treated with UST.Twenty-seven patients with active CD were enrolled in this study. Seventeen patients were treated with UST, and 10 patients were treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha therapy. The changes in the proportions of T-cell subsets after these therapies were analyzed by flow cytometry. Comprehensive gene expression changes in the colonic mucosa were also evaluated.The frequency of T helper (Th) 17 cells was significantly decreased in the peripheral blood of patients with active CD after UST therapy. Anti-TNF therapy had a minimal effect on Th17 cells but increased the proportion of regulatory T cells. Enrichment analysis showed the expression of genes involved in the Th17 differentiation pathway was downregulated in the colonic mucosa after UST but not anti-TNF therapy. There were no common differentially expressed genes between CD patients treated with UST and anti-TNF therapy, suggesting a clear difference in their mechanism of action.In patients with active CD, UST therapy suppressed Th17 cell differentiation both in the peripheral blood and colonic tissues.© 2021 S.

  Title: Multiomics analyses reveal a critical role of selenium in controlling T cell differentiation in Crohn's disease.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) mainly includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Immune disorders play an essential role in the pathogenesis of these two IBDs, but the differences in the immune microenvironment of the colon and their underlying mechanisms remain poorly investigated. Here we examined the immunological features and metabolic microenvironment of untreated individuals with IBD by multiomics analyses. Modulation of CD-specific metabolites, particularly reduced selenium, can obviously shape type 1 T helper (Th1) cell differentiation, which is specifically enriched in CD. Selenium supplementation suppressed the symptoms and onset of CD and Th1 cell differentiation via selenoprotein W (SELW)-mediated cellular reactive oxygen species scavenging. SELW promoted purine salvage pathways and inhibited one-carbon metabolism by recruiting an E3 ubiquitin ligase, tripartite motif-containing protein 21, which controlled the stability of serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2. Our work highlights selenium as an essential regulator of T cell responses and potential therapeutic targets in CD.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

  Title: Immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment induces colitis with heavy infiltration of CD8 + T cells and an infiltration pattern that resembles ulcerative colitis.
  Abstract: Colitis is a common, but poorly understood, adverse event of immune checkpoint inhibitors that are standard-of-care for an expanding range of cancer types. This explorative study aimed to describe the immune infiltrates in the colon from individuals developing checkpoint inhibitor colitis and compare them to well-known immunophenotypes of acute graft-versus-host disease, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease. Colon biopsies (n = 20 per group) of patients with checkpoint inhibitor colitis, acute graft-versus-host disease, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, all colitis treatment-naïve, and of individuals with a normal colon were analyzed using immunohistochemistry: CD8 for cytotoxic T cells, CD4 for T helper cells, and CD68 to identify cells of macrophage lineage. CD8 + T cell, CD4 + T cell, and CD68 + cell counts were performed. Cell infiltration was scored as scattered/patchy or band-like in the superficial and deep gut mucosa. Checkpoint inhibitor colitis was found to be heavily infiltrated by CD8 + T cells. Comparative analysis between groups showed that both CD8 + T cell counts (P < 0.01) and immune cell infiltration patterns in checkpoint inhibitor colitis were most similar to those observed in ulcerative colitis, with a deep band-like CD4 + T cell infiltration pattern and a superficial band-like CD68 + cell infiltration pattern in both. In conclusion, this is the first immunohistopathological study comparing infiltrate characteristics of checkpoint inhibitor colitis, acute graft-versus-host disease, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease. Checkpoint inhibitor colitis samples are heterogeneous, heavily infiltrated by CD8 + T cells, and show an immune cell infiltration pattern that is more similar to ulcerative colitis than to colonic acute graft-versus-host disease or colonic Crohn's disease.© 2021.

  Title: Twist1 contributes to developing and sustaining corticosteroid resistance in ulcerative colitis.
  Abstract: Rationale: Corticosteroid resistance (CR) is a serious drawback to steroid therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC); the underlying mechanism is incompletely understood. Twist1 protein (TW1) is an apoptosis inhibitor and has immune regulatory functions. This study aims to elucidate the roles of TW1 in inducing and sustaining the CR status in UC. Methods: Surgically removed colon tissues of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) were collected, from which neutrophils were isolated by flow cytometry. The inflammation-related gene activities in neutrophils were analyzed by RNA sequencing. A CR colitis mouse model was developed with the dextran sulfate sodium approach in a hypoxia environment. Results: Higher TW1 gene expression was detected in neutrophils isolated from the colon tissues of UC patients with CR and the CR mouse colon tissues. TW1 physically interacted with glucocorticoid receptor (GR)α in CR neutrophils that prevented GRα from interacting with steroids; which consequently abrogated the effects of steroids on regulating the cellular activities of neutrophils. STAT3 (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-3) interacted with Ras protein activator like 1 to sustain the high TW1 expression in colon mucosal neutrophils of CR patients and CR mice. Inhibition of TW1 restored the sensitivity to corticosteroid of neutrophils in the colon tissues of a CR murine model. Conclusions: UC patients at CR status showed high TW1 expression in neutrophils. TW1 prevented steroids from regulating neutrophil activities. Inhibition of TW1 restored the sensitivity to corticosteroids in the colon tissues at the CR status.© The author(s).

  Title: Molsidomine alleviates acetic acid-induced colitis in rats by reducing oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a subcategory of intestinal inflammatory bowel disease characterized by up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. The current study was designed to assess the probable protective effect of the nitric oxide (NO) donor, molsidomine, in experimental colitis model in rats. Rats were haphazardly classified into four groups: control, acetic acid, acetic acid + molsidomine (1 mg/kg) and acetic acid + molsidomine (2 mg/kg). Molsidomine (1 and 2 mg/kg/day) was administered by intra-peritoneal injection for 7 days prior to induction of UC. On the 8th day, colitis was induced by intra-rectal instillation of 2 ml of (4% v/v) acetic acid in normal saline using a pediatric plastic catheter. The rats were sacrificed 1 day following colitis induction, blood samples were obtained; colons and livers were isolated then underwent macroscopic, biochemical, histopathological and immunohistochemical examination. Pretreatment with molsidomine significantly reduced disease activity index, colon mass index, colonic macroscopic and histological damage. Besides, molsidomine significantly reduced the serum levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) (58.7 ± 8.9 & 59.7 ± 8 vs 288.75 ± 31.4 in AA group) and aspartate transaminase (AST) (196.2 ± 37.4 & 204 ± 30 vs 392.7 ± 35.6 in AA group). Moreover, molsidomine effectively decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) and total nitrate/nitrite (NOx) contents, and up regulated the enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione level (GSH) in colonic and hepatic tissues. With regard to anti-inflammatory mechanisms, molsidomine suppressed tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) (792.5 ± 16.7 & 448 ± 12.1 vs 1352.5 ± 45.8 in AA group) in colonic tissues and (701 ± 19 & 442.5 ± 22.5 vs 1501 ± 26 in AA group) in hepatic tissues as well as nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-kB/p65) levels (416.2 ± 4.1 & 185.5 ± 14.2 vs 659.2 ± 11.5 in AA group) in colonic tissues and (358 ± 6.2 & 163.5 ± 9.6 vs 732.5 ± 5.5 in AA group) in hepatic tissues. In addition, molsidomine significantly decreased inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) levels (8.1 ± 0.1 & 4.9 ± 0.1 vs 16 ± 0.1 in AA group) in colonic tissues and (8.6 ± 0.3 & 6.1 ± 0.1 vs 17.8 ± 0.1 in AA group) in hepatic tissues, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) contents (10.5 ± 0.4 & 6.6 ± 0.3 vs 20.9 ± 0.6 in AA group) in colonic tissues and (13.1 ± 0.2 & 6.3 ± 0.06 vs 23.9 ± 1.4 in AA group) in hepatic tissues at p > 0.05. Furthermore, it suppressed apoptosis by reducing expression of Caspase 3 and Bax in colonic and hepatic tissues. Therefore, molsidomine might be a promising candidate for the treatment of UC.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

  Title: Atypical HUS and Crohn's disease-interference of intestinal disease activity with complement-blocking treatment.
  Abstract: In atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (aHUS), various defects of the complement system have been reported to explain pathophysiology. Therapeutic options for complement inhibition are well-recognized; however, the links between various immune-derived diseases and aHUS are unclear, and their interference with treatment efficacy during long-term complement-blocking therapy is scarcely known.We present a pediatric patient who developed aHUS with acute kidney injury in parallel with the onset of Crohn's disease (CD), and who required long-term complement-blocking therapy with eculizumab (ECU). Unexpectedly, during the 6-year ECU treatment, an important intra-patient variation of the degree of complement inhibition was observed. In spite of continuous and stable doses of complement-blocking therapy, periods of incomplete blockade were observed in strong association with relapses of CD. When conventional and later biological therapy with adalimumab was introduced, with CD going into remission, complement blockade became complete again. Despite periodically low ECU levels and insufficient complement inhibition, no clinical or hematological signs of aHUS recurrence were detected during CD relapses.In aHUS cases secondary to CD, close monitoring of both complement inhibition and serum ECU levels is needed as intestinal disease can interfere with complement-blocking treatment. Increased doses of ECU may be necessary to maintain therapeutic blood levels of ECU and full complement blockade, especially if the intestinal disease is not under control.© 2021. The Author(s).

  Title: Linking the IL-17A immune response with NMR-based faecal metabolic profile in IBD patients treated with Mastiha.
  Abstract: Dysregulation of intestinal immune response plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Mastiha's anti-inflammatory properties are well established. Our aim was to investigate Mastiha's regulatory effect on IL-17A serum levels in IBD patients. Alterations of the faecal metabolome as a functional readout of microbial activity were explored. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design was applied for a total of 3 months in active and 6 months in inactive IBD patients. Serum IL-17A increased significantly in Mastiha group (p = 0.006), and the mean change differed significantly between Mastiha and placebo (p = 0.003) even after adjusting for age, sex and BMI (p = 0.001) in inactive patients. In inactive UC patients IL-17A decreased significantly only in placebo (p = 0.033). No significant differences were detected in active disease. Faecal metabolomics indicated that intervention with Mastiha influenced considerably the metabolic profile of IBD patients in remission exhibiting, in between others, increased levels of glycine and tryptophan. Glycine has been proposed to have a therapeutic effect against IBD, while tryptophan derivatives are involved in immunoregalutory mechanisms, such as the Th17 cells differentiation. Thus, it is quite possible that the immunoregulatory role of Mastiha in quiescent IBD involves the regulation of Th17 cells function and differentiation.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

  Title: A Novel Nanomedicine Ameliorates Acute Inflammatory Bowel Disease by Regulating Macrophages and T-Cells.
  Abstract: Ramulus mori polysaccharide (RMP), one of the most important active components of R. mori, has been attracting increasing interest because of its potent bioactive properties, including anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and antidiabetic effects. Despite the great therapeutic potential of RMP, its inherent properties of low bioavailability and brief biological half-life have limited its applications to the clinic. Thus, RMP was packaged by poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles to develop a novel anti-inflammatory nanomedicine (PLGA-RMP) in this study. The nanoparticles were synthesized via a double-emulsion solvent evaporation technique, and the average diameter of PLGA-RMP was about 202 nm. PLGA-RMP nanoparticles reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines while promoting the production of IL-10, and boosted the phenotypic shift in macrophages in vitro. Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in mouse was used to examine the anti-inflammatory effect of PLGA-RMP in vivo. Oral administration of PLGA-RMP in LPS-induced IBD mice substantially mitigated the intestinal inflammation compared to treatment with LPS alone, as evidenced by attenuation of disease activity index scores and inflammatory damage in the intestine. Meanwhile, PLGA-RMP suppressed the expression and secretion of specific inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and PGE2 in the inflamed intestine while inhibiting the activation of CD3+CD8+ T-cells and increasing the number of activated Tregs in the intestine. These results indicated that PLGA-RMP deserves further consideration as a potential therapeutic nanomedicine to treat various inflammatory diseases, including IBD.

  Title: Peripheral Opioid Receptor Blockade Enhances Epithelial Damage in Piroxicam-Accelerated Colitis in IL-10-Deficient Mice.
  Abstract: Mucosal CD4+ T lymphocytes display a potent opioid-mediated analgesic activity in interleukin (IL)-10 knockout mouse model of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Considering that endogenous opioids may also exhibit anti-inflammatory activities in the periphery, we examined the consequences of a peripheral opioid receptor blockade by naloxone-methiodide, a general opioid receptor antagonist unable to cross the blood-brain barrier, on the development of piroxicam-accelerated colitis in IL-10-deficient (IL-10-/-) mice. Here, we show that IL-10-deficient mice treated with piroxicam exhibited significant alterations of the intestinal barrier function, including permeability, inflammation-related bioactive lipid mediators, and mucosal CD4+ T lymphocyte subsets. Opioid receptor antagonization in the periphery had virtually no effect on colitis severity but significantly worsened epithelial cell apoptosis and intestinal permeability. Thus, although the endogenous opioid tone is not sufficient to reduce the severity of colitis significantly, it substantially contributes to the protection of the physical integrity of the epithelial barrier.

  Title: IF1 inactivation attenuates experimental colitis through downregulation of neutrophil infiltration in colon mucosa.
  Abstract: IF1 is a mitochondrial protein involved in the regulation of ATP synthase activity. The role of IF1 remains to be established in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In this study, we report that IF1 gene inactivation generated protection against IBD in the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model. IF1 gene knockout (IF1-KO) mice developed less severe colitis than the wild type (WT) mice as judged by parameters including disease activity index (DAI), body weight loss, inflammatory cytokines, leukocyte infiltration and bacterial invasion in the colon tissue. The intestinal barrier integrity was protected in the colon tissue of IF1-KO mice through a reduction in apoptosis and inflammasomal activity. The protection was abolished in the KO mice after substitution of the immune cells with the wild type cells following bone marrow transplantation. Depletion of neutrophils with anti-Gr-1 antibody abolished the protection from colitis in IF1-KO mice. Neutrophil number was decreased in the peripheral blood of IF1-KO mice, which was associated with a reduction in LC3A/B proteins in the KO neutrophils in Rapamycin-induced autophagy response. Inhibition of autophagy with the lysosome inhibitor Chloroquine (CQ) decreased the absolute number of neutrophils in WT mice and protected the mice from colitis. Taken together, these findings suggest that IF1 may contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD through acceleration of neutrophil autophagy. The activity is attenuated in the IF1-KO mice through reduction of autophagy in neutrophils leading to resistance to IBD.Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier B.V.

  Title: Tryptophan metabolites modulate inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer by affecting immune system.
  Abstract: Tryptophan is an essential amino acid, going through three different metabolic pathways in the intestines. Indole pathway in the gut microbiota, serotonin system in the enterochromaffin cells and kynurenine pathway in the immune cells and intestinal lining are the three arms of tryptophan metabolism in the intestines. Clinical, in vivo and in vitro studies showed that each one of these arms has a significant impact on IBD. This review explains how different metabolites of tryptophan are involved in the pathophysiology of IBD and colorectal cancer, as a major complication of IBD. Indole metabolites alleviate colitis and protect against colorectal cancer while serotonin arm follows a more complicated and receptor-specific pattern. Indole metabolites and kynurenine interact with aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) to induce T regulatory cells differentiation, confine Th17 and Th1 response and produce anti-inflammatory mediators. Kynurenine decreases tumor-infiltrating CD8+ cells and mediates tumor cells immune evasion. Serotonin system also increases colorectal cancer cells proliferation and metastasis while, indole metabolites can profoundly decrease colorectal cancer growth. Targeted therapy for tryptophan metabolites may improve the management of IBD and colorectal cancer, e.g. supplementation of indole metabolites such as indole-3-carbinol (I3C), inhibition of kynurenine monooxygenase (KMO) and selective stimulation or inhibition of specific serotonergic receptors can mitigate colitis. Furthermore, it will be explained how indole metabolites supplementation, inhibition of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), KMO and serotonin receptors can protect against colorectal cancer. Additionally, extensive molecular interactions between tryptophan metabolites and intracellular signaling pathways will be thoroughly discussed.

  Title: Thiopurine pharmacogenomics and pregnancy in inflammatory bowel disease.
  Abstract: The thiopurine drugs azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine are widely used for the maintenance of clinical remission in steroid-dependent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Thiopurines are recommended to be continued throughout pregnancy in IBD patients, but conclusive safety data in pregnant patients remain still insufficient. On the other hand, a strong association between a genetic variant of nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X-type motif 15 (NUDT15 p.Arg139Cys) and thiopurine-induced myelotoxicity has been identified. Pharmacokinetic studies have revealed that thiopurine metabolism is altered in pregnant IBD patients and suggested that the fetus may be exposed to the active-thiopurine metabolite, 6-thioguaninetriphosphate, in the uterus. A recent study using knock-in mice harboring the p.Arg138Cys mutation which corresponds to human p.Arg139Cys showed that oral administration of 6-MP at clinical dose induces a severe toxic effect on the fetus harboring the homozygous or heterozygous risk allele. This suggests that NUDT15 genotyping may be required in both women with IBD who are planning pregnancy (or pregnant) and their partner to avoid adverse outcomes for their infant. The risk to the fetus due to maternal thiopurine use is minimal but there are some concerns that are yet to be clarified. In particular, a pharmacogenomic approach to the fetus is considered necessary.© 2021. Japanese Society of Gastroenterology.

  Title: Natural flavone tricin exerted anti-inflammatory activity in macrophage via NF-κB pathway and ameliorated acute colitis in mice.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis is a subtype of inflammatory bowel disease, characterized by relapsing inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract with limited treatment options. Previous studies suggested that the natural compound tricin, a flavone isolated from rice bran, could suppress chemically-induced colitis in mice, while our recent study also demonstrated the anti-metastatic effect of tricin in colon tumor-bearing mice.Here we further investigated the underlying mechanism of the inhibitory effects of tricin on lipopolysaccharides-activated macrophage RAW264.7 cells and explored the efficacy of tricin in acute colitis mouse model induced by 4.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 7 days.Tricin (75, 100, and 150 mg/kg) or the positive control drug sulfasalazine (200 mg/kg) were orally administered to mice for 7 days. Stool consistency scores, stool blood scores, and body weight were recorded daily. Disease activity index (DAI) was examined on day 7, and colon tissues were collected for biochemical analyses. The fecal microbiome of colitis mice after tricin treatment was characterized for the first time in this study using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing.Results showed that tricin (50 µM) remarkably reduced nitric oxide production in lipopolysaccharides-activated RAW264.7 cells and the anti-inflammatory activity of tricin was shown to act through the NF-κB pathway. Besides, tricin treatment at 150 mg/kg significantly reversed colon length reduction, reduced myeloperoxidase activities and DAI scores, as well as restored the elevated myeloid-derived suppressive cells population in acute colitis mice. The influence from DSS on gut microbiota, such as the increased population of Proteobacteria phylum and Ruminococcaceae family, was shown to be relieved after tricin treatment.Our present study firstly demonstrated that tricin ameliorated acute colitis by improving colonic inflammation and modulating gut microbiota profile, which supports the potential therapeutic use of tricin for colitis treatment.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier GmbH.

  Title: False-positive HIV serology, Candida lusitaniae pneumonia, and a novel mutation in the CYBB gene.
  Abstract: Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) presents with a myriad of clinical manifestations pertaining to both immunodeficiency and hyperinflammation. Although Candida infection is a signature organism for patients with CGD, C. lusitaniae pneumonia in CGD has rarely been reported. C. lusitaniae is a ubiquitous ascomycete predominantly infecting immunocompromised hosts and has the potential to rapidly develop multi-drug resistance during therapy. Additionally, C. lusitaniae is recognized for its variable resistance against amphotericin B. To date, C. lusitaniae infections in patients with CGD have not been reviewed in detail. False-positive HIV serology, resulting from polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, has been reported in association with several infections, auto-immune diseases, and malignancies. Although CGD is often associated with hypergammaglobulinemia, a false-positive HIV serology in CGD has not been reported previously.We report a combination of unique findings in a child with CGD - a false-positive HIV serology, Candida lusitaniae pneumonia, and a novel CYBB mutation. We also provide a detailed review of C. lusitaniae infections in patients with CGD.In patients with CGD, C. lusitaniae has been reported to cause lymphadenitis (cervical, abdominal), fungemia, meningoencephalitis, or abscesses in the liver and spleen. Many CGD patients with C. lusitaniae infection have associated inflammatory complications of the gut (inflammatory bowel disease, colitis). Additionally, almost all C. lusitaniae infections in CGD have been reported in young infants or in patients receiving long-term immunosuppressive therapy. This reflects that further immunocompromise (in addition to the underlying immune deficiency in CGD) may specifically predispose to C. lusitaniae infection (unlike other candidal infections). Most of the CGD patients with documented C. lusitaniae infection have X-linked form of the disease which generally has been postulated to have a more severe clinical phenotype than the autosomal recessive forms of the disease.HIV serology may be positive in patients with CGD and other inborn errors of immunity as a result of hypergammaglobulinemia. C. lusitaniae, which may have peculiar and evolving antimicrobial sensitivity patterns, needs to be considered in patients with CGD and pneumonia. Lastly, to reiterate, CGD should to be considered in patients with proven C. lusitaniae infection.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

  Title: Therapeutic monitoring of adalimumab at non-trough levels in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
  Abstract: Adalimumab (ADA) trough level and anti-ADA antibody (AAA) positivity influence mucosal healing and loss of response in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this study, we clarified the correlation between ADA monitoring, including non-trough level, and real-world IBD clinical outcomes. This retrospective, observational, single-center study involved patients with ulcerative colitis (19) and Crohn's disease (33) treated with ADA from January 2007 to August 2018. Serum ADA and AAA levels were measured 4‒14 days after ADA administration. The AAA positivity rate was 23.1% (12/52). ADA continuity was higher in AAA-negative patients than in AAA-positive patients (P = 0.223). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that a serum AAA cut-off of 9.2 μg/mL was associated with ADA continuity. The ADA level was significantly higher in the endoscopic remission group than in the non-remission group (P = 0.02). Based on the ROC curve analysis results of serum ADA level and endoscopic remission, the cut-off value of the serum ADA level was set to 11.1 μg/mL. Under the combined use of ADA with immunomodulators and AAA positivity, ADA continuity was significantly higher when the serum AAA level at 4-14 days after ADA administration was ≥9.2 μg/mL. Furthermore, endoscopic remission can be expected with a serum ADA level of ≥11.1 μg/mL. Overall, to predict clinical outcomes, it would be useful to measure the blood level of ADA regardless of the timing of the trough.

  Title: Icariin Inhibits Intestinal Inflammation of DSS-Induced Colitis Mice Through Modulating Intestinal Flora Abundance and Modulating p-p65/p65 Molecule.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis, as a kind of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by abdominal pain. This study aimed to investigate the effect of icariin (ICA) on the intestinal microflora of colitis mice.Fifteen female C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into the Control group, dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis (DSS) group, and ICA treatment (DSS+ICA) group. The severity of inflammation in DSS-induced colitis mice was evaluated using disease activity scoring (considering weight-loss percentage, stool-shape change, and stool-bleeding scoring). Pathological changes of mice intestinal tract were evaluated using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Serum levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expressions of p65 and p-p65 (p-p65/p65 ratio) were analyzed using Western blot assay. 16S rDNA sequencing was used to analyze the abundance and composition of intestinal microflora.Compared with DSS group, ICA significantly improved disease activity (P < .05) and reduced inflammatory damage of colon tissues (P < .05) in DSS-induced colitis mice. Compared with the DSS group, mice in the ICA group demonstrated significant weight and colon length (P < .05). ICA significantly inhibited expressions of IL-6 and TNF-α compared to the DSS group (P < .05). p-p65/ p65 ratio in the DSS + ICA group was remarkably enhanced compared to the DSS group (P < .05). ICA significantly reduced the proportion and activity of Bacteroides, Helicobacteraceae, Turicibacter, and significantly increased that of beneficial microflora (Lactobacillus, Lachnospiraceae, Akkermansia), so as improved damages of colon tissues.ICA can improve intestinal flora abundance and composition of DSS-induced colitis mice, and inhibit tissue damage and inflammatory response through modulating the p-p65/p65 expression.

  Title: Duplication of the IL2RA locus causes excessive IL-2 signaling and may predispose to very early onset colitis.
  Abstract: Single genetic mutations predispose to very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD). Here, we identify a de novo duplication of the 10p15.1 chromosomal region, including the IL2RA locus, in a 2-year-old girl with treatment-resistant pancolitis that was brought into remission by colectomy. Strikingly, after colectomy while the patient was in clinical remission and without medication, the peripheral blood CD4:CD8 ratio was constitutively high and CD25 expression was increased on circulating effector memory, Foxp3+, and Foxp3neg CD4+ T cells compared to healthy controls. This high CD25 expression increased IL-2 signaling, potentiating CD4+ T-cell-derived IFNγ secretion after T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. Restoring CD25 expression using the JAK1/3-inhibitor tofacitinib controlled TCR-induced IFNγ secretion in vitro. As diseased colonic tissue, but not the unaffected duodenum, contained mainly CD4+ T cells with a prominent IFNγ-signature, we hypothesize that local microbial stimulation may have initiated colonic disease. Overall, we identify that duplication of the IL2RA locus can associate with VEO-IBD and suggest that increased IL-2 signaling predisposes to colonic intestinal inflammation.© 2021. The Author(s).

  Title: Mastiha has efficacy in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases through a microRNA-155 Th17 dependent action.
  Abstract: Mastiha is a natural nutritional supplement with known anti-inflammatory properties. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are immune mediated inflammatory diseases that share common pathophysiological features. Mastiha has shown beneficial effects in both diseases. MicroRNAs have emerged as key regulators of inflammation and their modulation by phytochemicals have been extensively studied over the last years. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether a common route exists in the anti-inflammatory activity of Mastiha, specifically through the regulation of miRNA levels. Plasma miR-16, miR-21 and miR-155 were measured by Real-Time PCR before and after two double blinded and placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials with Mastiha. In IBD and particularly in ulcerative colitis patients in relapse, miR-155 increased in the placebo group (p = 0.054) whereas this increase was prevented by Mastiha. The mean changes were different in the two groups even after adjusting for age, sex and BMI (p = 0.024 for IBD and p = 0.042). Although the results were not so prominent in NAFLD, miR-155 displayed a downward trend in the placebo group (p = 0.054) whereas the levels did not changed significantly in the Mastiha group in patients with less advanced fibrosis. Our results propose a regulatory role for Mastiha in circulating levels of miR-155, a critical player in T helper-17 (Th17) differentiation and function.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

  Title: Targeting of the Tec Kinase ITK Drives Resolution of T Cell-Mediated Colitis and Emerges as Potential Therapeutic Option in Ulcerative Colitis.
  Abstract: The molecular checkpoints driving T cell activation and cytokine responses in ulcerative colitis (UC) are incompletely understood. Here, we studied the Tec kinase ITK in UC.We analyzed patients with inflammatory bowel disease (n = 223) and evaluated ITK activity as well as the functional effects of cyclosporine-A (CsA). In addition, 3 independent murine colitis models were used to investigate the functional role of ITK. Finally, the activity of ITK was blocked via pharmacological inhibitors and genetically engineered mice. Readout parameters were mini-endoscopy, histopathology, mucosal T cell apoptosis, and cytokine production.We found an expansion of pITK-expressing mucosal CD4+ T cells in UC rather than Crohn's disease that correlated with disease severity. CsA suppressed activation of ITK in cultured CD4+ T cells and calcineurin-containing microclusters adjacent to the T cell receptor signaling complex. Functionally, the capacity of CsA to suppress activity of experimental colitis was critically dependent on ITK. Genetic inactivation of Itk via gene targeting or induction of allele-sensitive Itk mutants prevented experimental colitis in 3 colitis models, and treatment with pharmacological ITK blockers suppressed established colitis. In addition, ITK controlled apoptosis and activation of mucosal Th2 and Th17 lymphocytes via NFATc2 signaling pathways.ITK activation was detected in UC and could be down-regulated in cultured T cells by CsA administration. Selective targeting of ITK emerges as an attractive approach for treatment of chronic intestinal inflammation and potentially UC by driving resolution of mucosal inflammation.Copyright © 2021 AGA Institute.

  Title: Association of IgG1 Antibody Clearance with FcγRIIA Polymorphism and Platelet Count in Infliximab-Treated Patients.
  Abstract: The FcγRIIA/CD32A is mainly expressed on platelets, myeloid and several endothelial cells. Its affinity is considered insufficient for allowing significant binding of monomeric IgG, while its H131R polymorphism (histidine > arginine at position 131) influences affinity for multimeric IgG2. Platelet FcγRIIA has been reported to contribute to IgG-containing immune-complexe clearance. Given our finding that platelet FcγRIIA actually binds monomeric IgG, we investigated the role of platelets and FcγRIIA in IgG antibody elimination. We used pharmacokinetics analysis of infliximab (IgG1) in individuals with controlled Crohn's disease. The influence of platelet count and FcγRIIA polymorphism was quantified by multivariate linear modelling. The infliximab half-life increased with R allele number (13.2, 14.4 and 15.6 days for HH, HR and RR patients, respectively). It decreased with increasing platelet count in R carriers: from ≈20 days (RR) and ≈17 days (HR) at 150 × 109/L, respectively, to ≈13 days (both HR and RR) at 350 × 109/L. Moreover, a flow cytometry assay showed that infliximab and monomeric IgG1 bound efficiently to platelet FcγRIIA H and R allotypes, whereas panitumumab and IgG2 bound poorly to the latter. We propose that infliximab (and presumably any IgG1 antibody) elimination is partly due to an unappreciated mechanism dependent on binding to platelet FcγRIIA, which is probably tuned by its affinity for IgG2.

The infliximab half-life increased with R allele number (13.2, 14.4 and 15.6 days for HH, HR and RR patients, respectively). It decreased with increasing platelet count in R carriers: from ≈20 days (RR) and ≈17 days (HR) at 150 × 109/L, respectively, to ≈13 days (both HR and RR) at 350 × 109/L. Moreover, a flow cytometry assay showed that infliximab and monomeric IgG1 bound efficiently to platelet FcγRIIA H and R allotypes, whereas panitumumab and IgG2 bound poorly to the latter. We propose that infliximab (and presumably any IgG1 antibody) elimination is partly due to an unappreciated mechanism dependent on binding to platelet FcγRIIA, which is probably tuned by its affinity for IgG2.

  Title: Vitamin D Is Associated with α4β7+ Immunophenotypes and Predicts Vedolizumab Therapy Failure in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Abstract: Vitamin D downregulates the in vitro expression of the gut-tropic integrin α4β7 on immune cells. The clinical relevance of this finding in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is unclear. We tested the hypothesis that vitamin D is associated with α4β7 immunophenotypes and risk of vedolizumab [anti-α4β7] failure in IBD.We performed single-cell immunophenotyping of peripheral and intestinal immune cells using mass cytometry [CyTOF] in vedolizumab-naïve patients with IBD [N = 48]. We analysed whole-genome mucosal gene expression [GSE73661] from GEMINI I and GEMINI long-term safety [LTS] to determine the association between vitamin D receptor [VDR] and integrin alpha-4 [ITGA4] and beta-7 [ITGB7] genes. We estimated the odds of vedolizumab failure with low pre-treatment vitamin D in a combined retrospective and prospective IBD cohort [N = 252] with logistic regression.Immunophenotyping revealed that higher 25[OH]D was associated with decreased α4β7+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells [R = -0.400, p <0.01] and α4β7+ intestinal leukocytes [R = -0.538, p = 0.03]. Serum 25[OH]D was inversely associated with α4β7+ peripheral B cells and natural killer [NK] cells and α4β7+ intestinal B cells, NK cells, monocytes, and macrophages. Mucosal expression of VDR was inversely associated with ITGA4 and ITGB7 expression. In multivariate analysis, 25[OH]D <25 ng/mL was associated with increased vedolizumab primary non-response during induction (odds ratio [OR] 26.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 14.30-48.90, p <0.001) and failure at 1-year follow-up [OR 6.10, 95% CI 3.06-12.17, p <0.001].Low serum 25[OH]D is associated with α4β7+ immunophenotypes and predicts future vedolizumab failure in patients with IBD.This article has an associated podcast which can be accessed at https://academic.oup.com/ecco-jcc/pages/podcast.© The Author(s) 2021.

  Title: Interferon-Gamma-Producing CD8+ Tissue Resident Memory T Cells Are a Targetable Hallmark of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Colitis.
  Abstract: The pathogenesis of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-colitis remains incompletely understood. We sought to identify key cellular drivers of ICI-colitis and their similarities to idiopathic ulcerative colitis, and to determine potential novel therapeutic targets.We used a cross-sectional approach to study patients with ICI-colitis, those receiving ICI without the development of colitis, idiopathic ulcerative colitis, and healthy controls. A subset of patients with ICI-colitis were studied longitudinally. We applied a range of methods, including multiparameter and spectral flow cytometry, spectral immunofluorescence microscopy, targeted gene panels, and bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing.We demonstrate CD8+ tissue resident memory T (TRM) cells are the dominant activated T cell subset in ICI-colitis. The pattern of gastrointestinal immunopathology is distinct from ulcerative colitis at both the immune and epithelial-signaling levels. CD8+ TRM cell activation correlates with clinical and endoscopic ICI-colitis severity. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis confirms activated CD8+ TRM cells express high levels of transcripts for checkpoint inhibitors and interferon-gamma in ICI-colitis. We demonstrate similar findings in both anti-CTLA-4/PD-1 combination therapy and in anti-PD-1 inhibitor-associated colitis. On the basis of our data, we successfully targeted this pathway in a patient with refractory ICI-colitis, using the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib.Interferon gamma-producing CD8+ TRM cells are a pathological hallmark of ICI-colitis and a novel target for therapy.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

  Title: [rCsHscB derived from Clonorchis sinensis has therapeutic effect on dextran sodium sulfate-induced chronic ulcerative colitis in mice].
  Abstract: To investigate the therapeutic effect of rCsHscB derived from Clonorchis sinensis on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced chronic ulcerative colitis in mice.C57BL/6 mice were randomized into negative control (NC) group (n= 10), rCsHscB group (n=10), DSS group (n=15), and DSS+rCsHscB group (n=15), and in the latter two groups, chronic ulcerative colitis was induced in the mice using 2% DSS. In rCsHscB and DSS+ rCsHscB groups, the mice received intraperitoneal injections of 125 μg/mL rCsHscB on the 4th and 7th day following DSS administration, and PBS was injected in the other two groups. The mice were euthanized on the 84th day, and pathological changes of the colon were evaluated by HE and Masson staining. The levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood and lamina propria gastric lymphocytes (LPL) were analyzed by flow cytometer; the levels of IL-6, MCP-1 and IL-10 in colon homogenate were determined using ELISA, and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK and P38 was detected with Western blotting.Compared with those in NC group, the mice in rCsHscB group exhibited no adverse responses to the treatment. The mice in DSS group had severe pathologies in the colon with significantly increased ratios of CD4+ and CD4+/CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood and LPL, increased levels of IL-6 and MCP-1 but no obvious changes in IL-10 in colon homogenate, and significantly augmented phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2, JNK and P38. Compared with those in DSS group, the mice in DSS+ rCsHscB group showed ameliorated colon pathologies with decreased CD4+T/CD8+T cell ratio in the peripheral blood and LPL, significantly decreased IL-6 and MCP-1 levels and increased IL-10 in colon homogenate, and lowered phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2, JNK and P38.rCsHscB can produce therapeutic effect on DSS-induced chronic ulcerative colitis in mice possibly by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory factors and regulating the balance of CD4+/CD8+T cells through the MAPK pathway.

  Title: Impaired Luminal Control of Intestinal Macrophage Maturation in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis During Remission.
  Abstract: Intestinal macrophages adopt a hyporesponsive phenotype through education by local signals. Lack of proper macrophage maturation in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in remission may initiate gut inflammation. The aim, therefore, was to determine the effects of fecal luminal factors derived from healthy donors and UC patients in remission on macrophage phenotype and function.Fecal supernatants (FS) were extracted from fecal samples of healthy subjects and UC patients in remission. Monocytes were matured into macrophages in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor without/with FS, stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, and macrophage phenotype and function were assessed. Fecal metabolomic profiles were analyzed by gas-chromatography/mass-spectrometry.Fecal luminal factors derived from healthy donors were effective in down-regulating Toll-like receptor signaling, cytokine signaling, and antigen presentation in macrophages. Fecal luminal factors derived from UC patients in remission were less potent in inducing lipopolysaccharide hyporesponsiveness and modulating expression of genes involved in macrophage cytokine and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways. Although phagocytic and bactericidal abilities of macrophages were not affected by FS treatment, healthy FS-treated macrophages showed a greater ability to suppress cluster of differentiation 4+ T-cell activation and interferon γ secretion compared with UC remission FS-treated counterparts. Furthermore, metabolomic analysis showed differential fecal metabolite composition for healthy donors and UC patients in remission.Our data indicate that UC patients in remission lack luminal signals able to condition macrophages toward a hyporesponsive and tolerogenic phenotype, which may contribute to their persistent vulnerability to relapse.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

  Title: Effects of hydro-ethanolic extract of leaves of Maesa lanceolata (Mursinaceae) on acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis in rats.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis is a form of inflammatory bowel disease that is characterized by acute and chronic inflammation. The aim of this work was to evaluate the efficacy of hydroethanolic extract of Maesa lanceolata leaves on acetic acid-induced colitis in rats. Colitis was induced by rectal administration of 1 mL of acetic acid (4%) in 25 male rats except the normal control group which received distilled water after 18 h of fasting followed by Ketamine (50 mg/kg)/Valium (10 mg/kg) anesthesia. Five hours later, the normal control and the negative control received distilled water, the positive control received prednisolone (5 mg/kg) and the three test groups received extract at 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg bw for eight days. During treatment, rectal temperature, the number and quality of the stools, and changes in body weight were assessed. At the end of the treatment, the animals were sacrificed, blood, colon, liver and spleen were collected for evaluation of hematological, inflammatory, antioxidant and histological parameters. Rectal temperature and the number of diarrheal, mucus and bloody stools were significantly reduced (P < 0.01) during treatment in the test and positive control groups with an increase in body weight change. The extract significantly (P < 0.01) reduced myeloperoxidase, TNF-α, interleukin 6, NO and MDA levels and significantly (P < 0.01) increased SOD levels, of GSH and catalase activity in the colon and blood. This extract also increased (P < 0.01) levels of red blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, total white blood cells and blood platelets, prevented leukocyte infiltration in the liver and colon.© 2021.

  Title: Albumin-to-Globulin Ratio at 1 Year after Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor α Therapy Can Serve as a Prognostic Biomarker in Pediatric Crohn's Disease Patients.
  Abstract: The efficacy of biologics for the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD) is affected by the drug concentrations. We aimed to evaluate the importance of albumin and globulin which are known to be associated with drug concentrations as prognostic biomarkers in CD.In total, 121 pediatric patients with CD who had received anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α therapy were retrospectively examined between January 2010 and February 2019.Relapse was observed in 48.8% of patients (59/121). The level of calprotectin (odds ratio, 2.13; p=0.03) and the albumin-to-globulin ratio (AGR) at 1 year after anti-TNF-α therapy (odds ratio, 0.0002; p=0.003) were associated with relapse. The AGR at 1 year after anti-TNF-α therapy was the only factor associated with the time-to-relapse (hazard ratio, 0.02; p<0.001). The optimal AGR cutoff value for the prediction of relapse was 1.47 (area under the curve, 0.916; p<0.001). The median infliximab trough level (TL) was lower in patients with AGRs <1.47 than in those with AGRs ≥1.47. Anti-drug antibody (ADA) concentrations were negatively correlated with the AGR at 1 year of anti-TNF-α therapy (r=-0.413, p=0.032).AGR can be used to predict relapse. Patients with AGRs <1.47 at 1 year after anti-TNF-α therapy are more likely to have low drug TLs and develop ADAs, which increase the possibility of relapse than those with AGRs ≥1.47. Therefore, if the AGR at 1 year after anti-TNF-α therapy is less than 1.47, clinicians should monitor disease activity, assess the TLs of the anti-TNF-α agents, test for ADAs and determine the appropriate therapeutic strategies.

  Title: Fish Sidestream-Derived Protein Hydrolysates Suppress DSS-Induced Colitis by Modulating Intestinal Inflammation in Mice.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease is characterized by extensive intestinal inflammation, and therapies against the disease target suppression of the inflammatory cascade. Nutrition has been closely linked to the development and suppression of inflammatory bowel disease, which to a large extent is attributed to the complex immunomodulatory properties of nutrients. Diets containing fish have been suggested to promote health and suppress inflammatory diseases. Even though most of the health-promoting properties of fish-derived nutrients are attributed to fish oil, the potential health-promoting properties of fish protein have not been investigated. Fish sidestreams contain large amounts of proteins, currently unexploited, with potential anti-inflammatory properties, and may possess additional benefits through bioactive peptides and free amino acids. In this project, we utilized fish protein hydrolysates, based on mackerel and salmon heads and backbones, as well as flounder skin collagen. Mice fed with a diet supplemented with different fish sidestream-derived protein hydrolysates (5% w/w) were exposed to the model of DSS-induced colitis. The results show that dietary supplements containing protein hydrolysates from salmon heads suppressed chemically-induced colitis development as determined by colon length and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. To evaluate colitis severity, we measured the expression of different pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and found that the same supplement suppressed the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNFα and the chemokines Cxcl1 and Ccl3. We also assessed the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and Tgfb and found that selected protein hydrolysates induced their expression. Our findings demonstrate that protein hydrolysates derived from fish sidestreams possess anti-inflammatory properties in the model of DSS-induced colitis, providing a novel underexplored source of health-promoting dietary supplements.

  Title: Pathological Role of Pin1 in the Development of DSS-Induced Colitis.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are serious disorders of which the etiologies are not, as yet, fully understood. In this study, Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (Pin1) protein was shown to be dramatically upregulated in the colons of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis model mice. Interestingly, Pin1 knockout (KO) mice exhibited significant attenuation of DSS-induced colitis compared to wild-type (WT) mice, based on various parameters, including body weight, colon length, microscopic observation of the intestinal mucosa, inflammatory cytokine expression, and cleaved caspase-3. In addition, a role of Pin1 in inflammation was suggested because the percentage of M1-type macrophages in the colon was decreased in the Pin1 KO mice while that of M2-type macrophages was increased. Moreover, Pin1 KO mice showed downregulation of both Il17 and Il23a expression in the colon, both of which have been implicated in the development of colitis. Finally, oral administration of Pin1 inhibitor partially but significantly prevented DSS-induced colitis in mice, raising the possibility of Pin1 inhibitors serving as therapeutic agents for IBD.

  Title: A novel gene associated with small bowel bleeding in patients taking low-dose aspirin.
  Abstract: We have previously revealed the clinical factors and genetic polymorphisms associated with gastrointestinal mucosal injury and bleeding, induced by low-dose aspirin (LDA). After performing genome-wide analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using the Drug Metabolizing Enzymes and Transporters (DMET) system among drug metabolism and transporter genes, certain SNPs were found to increase the risk for LDA-induced small bowel bleeding. The aim of this study was to identify the SNPs involved in LDA-induced small bowel bleeding.Subjects were patients taking LDA, with small bowel bleeding diagnosed using capsule endoscopy. We investigated the clinical characteristics and the previously identified SNPs, that were examined by the DNA direct sequence method.56 patients with bleeding and 410 controls taking LDA were enrolled. The risk factors associated with small bowel bleeding included smoking, cerebrovascular diseases, chronic renal failure, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or anticoagulants combination, and two SNPs (CYP4F11 20043G>A (D446N) rs1060463, GSTP1 313A>G rs1695). After propensity score matching, GSTP1 rs1695 was significantly associated with small bowel bleeding.The GSTP1 SNP may be a predictive marker for small bowel bleeding among patients taking LDA.Copyright © 2021 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

  Title: Rapidity of clinical response to adalimumab and improvement of quality of life in luminal Crohn's disease: RAPIDA study.
  Abstract: No studies evaluating the rapidity of response to biological therapies are available for Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to evaluate rapidity of onset of clinical response and impact on quality of life (QoL) of adalimumab therapy in adult anti-TNF-naïve patients with moderately-to-severely active CD.RAPIDA was an open-label, single-arm, prospective, multicenter clinical trial. Adult patients with moderately-to-severely active luminal CD, anti-TNF-naïve, and unresponsive to conventional therapy were treated with adalimumab. Clinical disease activity, QoL and inflammatory biomarkers were measured at day 4, and weeks 1, 2, 4, and 12 after treatment initiation.Eighty-six patients were included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. Clinical disease activity was reduced from a median of 9.0 points to 6.0 points at day 4. Clinical response (≥ 3-point reduction in the Harvey-Bradshaw Index, HBI) was achieved by 61.6% (d4) and 75.6% (w1) of patients in the ITT population (median 2.5 days) and with non-responder imputation (NRI), by 55.8% and 53.4%, respectively. The proportion of patients in clinical remission (HBI<5) at weeks 2 and 4 in the ITT population was 54.7% and 62.8%, respectively (median 7.0 days), and 38.4% and 45.3% in the NRI population. All QoL scores significantly improved and inflammatory biomarkers significantly decreased from day 4 onwards (p<0.0001).Rapid clinical response and remission, improvement in QoL and fatigue, and a reduction of inflammatory biomarkers were achieved with adalimumab as early as day 4 in adult anti-TNF-naïve patients with moderately-to-severely active CD.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier España, S.L.U.

  Title: Blood-based prognostic biomarkers in Crohn's Disease patients on biologics: a promising tool to predict endoscopic outcomes.
  Abstract: There is a growing need for biomarkers to predict therapeutic outcome in Crohn's disease (CD).The aim was to evaluate whether NLR (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio), PLR (platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio), ELR (eosinophil-to-lymphocyte ratio), and ENLR (eosinophil*neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio), could be prognostic biomarkers of endoscopic response (ER) when starting biologics.Patients with CD who started biologics were enrolled. Multivariate analysis was used to evaluate whether NLR, PLR, ELR and ENLR at baseline and at w12 could predict ER (Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's disease [SES-CD] ≤2 or SES-CD≤2 and Rutgeerts i0-i1) after 52 weeks of treatment. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to find the cutoffs.107 patients were included. Patients who achieved ER had significantly lower baseline NLR (p = 0.025), ELR (p = 0.013), and ENLR (p = 0.020) compared with those without ER; results after 12 weeks of treatment for ELR (p = 0.006) and ENLR (p = 0.003). AUC was 0.64 (p = 0.003), 0.67 (p = 0.006) and 0.65 (p = 0.014) for NLR, ELR and ENLR.Low NLR, ELR and ENLR can predict ER and could be used in clinical practice for a better management of CD patients.

  Title: Risk factors and prognostic value of acute severe lower gastrointestinal bleeding in Crohn's disease.
  Abstract: Acute severe lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) is an uncommon but challenging complication of Crohn's disease (CD).To identify the predictors of acute severe LGIB and to evaluate the impact of acute severe LGIB on the subsequent clinical course in CD patients.A retrospective inception cohort study was conducted in 75 CD patients with acute severe LGIB and 1359 CD patients without acute severe LGIB who were diagnosed between February 1991 and November 2019 at Asan Medical Center, a tertiary university hospital in Korea. Multivariable analysis with Cox proportional hazard regression was performed to identify the risk factors for acute severe LGIB. A matched analysis using 72 patients with bleeding and 267 matched patients without within the cohort was also conducted to investigate whether acute severe LGIB is a predictor of clinical outcomes of CD.Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that early use of thiopurines [hazard ratio (HR): 0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.12-0.48; P < 0.001] and female sex (HR: 0.51, 95%CI: 0.27-0.94; P = 0.031) were significantly associated with a lower risk of acute severe LGIB.

  Title: Risk factors and prognostic value of acute severe lower gastrointestinal bleeding in Crohn's disease.
  Abstract: Acute severe lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) is an uncommon but challenging complication of Crohn's disease (CD).To identify the predictors of acute severe LGIB and to evaluate the impact of acute severe LGIB on the subsequent clinical course in CD patients.A retrospective inception cohort study was conducted in 75 CD patients with acute severe LGIB and 1359 CD patients without acute severe LGIB who were diagnosed between February 1991 and November 2019 at Asan Medical Center, a tertiary university hospital in Korea. Multivariable analysis with Cox proportional hazard regression was performed to identify the risk factors for acute severe LGIB. A matched analysis using 72 patients with bleeding and 267 matched patients without within the cohort was also conducted to investigate whether acute severe LGIB is a predictor of clinical outcomes of CD.Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that early use of thiopurines [hazard ratio (HR): 0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.12-0.48; P < 0.001] and female sex (HR: 0.51, 95%CI: 0.27-0.94; P = 0.031) were significantly associated with a lower risk of acute severe LGIB. The cumulative risks of behavioral progression and intestinal resection were not significantly different between the two matched groups (P = 0.139 and P = 0.769, respectively). The hospitalization rate was higher in the bleeding group than in the matched non-bleeding group (22.1/100 vs 13.2/100 patient-years; P = 0.012). However, if hospitalizations due to bleeding episodes were excluded from the analysis, the hospitalization rate was not significantly different between the bleeding group and the matched non-bleeding group (14.5/100 vs 13.2/100 patient-years; P = 0.631).Early use of thiopurines may reduce the risk of acute severe LGIB. History of acute severe LGIB may not have a significant prognostic value in patients with CD.©The Author(s) 2021. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved.

  Title: Gastric cancer, inflammatory bowel disease and polyautoimmunity in a 17-year-old boy: CTLA-4 deficiency successfully treated with Abatacept.
  Abstract: Gut involvement is frequent in immunologic disorders, especially with inflammatory manifestations but also with cancer. In the last years, advances in functional and genetic testing have improved the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to immune dysregulation syndromes. CTLA-4 deficiency is a rare disease with variable phenotype, ranging from absence of symptoms to severe multisystem manifestations and complications. We describe a rare case of CTLA-4 deficiency in a boy with gastric cancer, very early onset inflammatory bowel disease and polyautoimmunity, the second-ever reported in the literature with the same characteristics. A 17-year-old boy was referred to Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital of Rome, a tertiary care center, for a gastric mass and a long-term history of very early onset inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes mellitus type 1, polyarthritis and psoriasis. Histology of gastric biopsies revealed the presence of neoplastic signet ring cells. Imaging staging showed localized cancer; therefore, the patient underwent subtotal gastrectomy with termino-lateral gastro-jejunal anastomosis. Immunological work up and genetic testing by next-generation sequencing panels for primary immunodeficiencies led to the diagnosis of CTLA-4 deficiency. Good disease control was obtained with the administration of Abatacept. The patient experienced an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection without any concern. Eighteen months after treatment initiation, the patient is alive and well. Immunologic and genetic testing, such as next-generation sequencing, should always be part of the diagnostic approach to patients with complex immune dysregulation syndrome, severe clinical course, poor response to treatments or cancer. The early recognition of the monogenic disease is the key for disease management and targeted therapy.Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

  Title: EMA401, an angiotensin II type 2 receptor antagonist blocks visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability in rat model of irritable bowel syndrome.
  Abstract: Visceral hypersensitivity and impaired gut barrier are crucial pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and injection of lipopolysaccharide or corticotropin-releasing factor, and repeated water avoidance stress simulate these gastrointestinal changes in rat (IBS models). We previously demonstrated that losartan, an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist prevented these changes, and we attempted to determine the effects of EMA401, an AT2 receptor antagonist in the current study. EMA401 blocked visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability in these models, and naloxone reversed the effects by EMA401. These results suggest that EMA401 may improve gut function via opioid signaling in IBS.Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

  Title: Targeting Immune Cell Trafficking - Insights From Research Models and Implications for Future IBD Therapy.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are multifactorial diseases with still unknown aetiology and an increasing prevalence and incidence worldwide. Despite plentiful therapeutic options for IBDs, the lack or loss of response in certain patients demands the development of further treatments to tackle this unmet medical need. In recent years, the success of the anti-α4β7 antibody vedolizumab highlighted the potential of targeting the homing of immune cells, which is now an important pillar of IBD therapy. Due to its complexity, leukocyte trafficking and the involved molecules offer a largely untapped resource for a plethora of potential therapeutic interventions. In this review, we aim to summarise current and future directions of specifically interfering with immune cell trafficking. We will comment on concepts of homing, retention and recirculation and particularly focus on the role of tissue-derived chemokines. Moreover, we will give an overview of the mode of action of drugs currently in use or still in the pipeline, highlighting their mechanisms and potential to reduce disease burden.Copyright © 2021 Wiendl, Becker, Müller, Voskens, Neurath and Zundler.

  Title: Immunomodulatory nanosystems for treating inflammatory diseases.
  Abstract: Inflammatory disease (ID) is an umbrella term encompassing all illnesses involving chronic inflammation as the central manifestation of pathogenesis. These include, inflammatory bowel diseases, hepatitis, pulmonary disorders, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, pancreatitis, arthritis, periodontitis, psoriasis. The IDs create a severe burden on healthcare and significantly impact the global socio-economic balance. Unfortunately, the standard therapies that rely on a combination of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents are palliative and provide only short-term relief. In contrast, the emerging concept of immunomodulatory nanosystems (IMNs) has the potential to address the underlying causes and prevent reoccurrence, thereby, creating new opportunities for treating IDs. The IMNs offer exquisite ability to precisely modulate the immune system for a therapeutic advantage. The nano-sized dimension of IMNs allows them to efficiently infiltrate lymphatic drainage, interact with immune cells, and subsequently to undergo rapid endocytosis by hyperactive immune cells (HICs) at inflamed sites. Thus, IMNs serve to restore dysfunctional or HICs and alleviate the inflammation. We identified that different IMNs exert their immunomodulatory action via either of the seven mechanisms to modulate; cytokine production, cytokine neutralization, cellular infiltration, macrophage polarization, HICs growth inhibition, stimulating T-reg mediated tolerance and modulating oxidative-stress. In this article, we discussed representative examples of IMNs by highlighting their rationalization, design principle, and mechanism of action in context of treating various IDs. Lastly, we highlighted technical challenges in the application of IMNs and explored the future direction of research, which could potentially help to overcome those challenges.Copyright © 2021.

  Title: Recurrence of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis After Liver Transplant in Children: An International Observational Study.
  Abstract: Recurrent primary sclerosing cholangitis (rPSC) following liver transplant (LT) has a negative impact on graft and patient survival; little is known about risk factors for rPSC or disease course in children.We retrospectively evaluated risk factors for rPSC in 140 children from the Pediatric PSC Consortium, a multicenter international registry. Recipients underwent LT for PSC and had >90 days of follow-up. The primary outcome, rPSC, was defined using Graziadei criteria. Median follow-up after LT was 3 years (interquartile range 1.1-6.1). rPSC occurred in 36 children, representing 10% and 27% of the subjects at 2 years and 5 years following LT, respectively. Subjects with rPSC were younger at LT (12.9 vs. 16.2 years), had faster progression from PSC diagnosis to LT (2.5 vs. 4.1 years), and had higher alanine aminotransferase (112 vs. 66 IU/L) at LT (all P < 0.01). Inflammatory bowel disease was more prevalent in the rPSC group (86% vs. 66%; P = 0.025). After LT, rPSC subjects had more episodes of biopsy-proved acute rejection (mean 3 vs. 1; P < 0.001), and higher prevalence of steroid-refractory rejection (41% vs. 20%; P = 0.04). In those with rPSC, 43% developed complications of portal hypertension, were relisted for LT, or died within 2 years of the diagnosis. Mortality was higher in the rPSC group (11.1% vs. 2.9%; P = 0.05).The incidence of rPSC in this cohort was higher than previously reported, and was associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Patients with rPSC appeared to have a more aggressive, immune-reactive phenotype. These findings underscore the need to understand the immune mechanisms of rPSC, to lay the foundation for developing new therapies and improve outcomes in this challenging population.© 2021 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.

  Title: Recurrence of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis After Liver Transplant in Children: An International Observational Study.
  Abstract: Recurrent primary sclerosing cholangitis (rPSC) following liver transplant (LT) has a negative impact on graft and patient survival; little is known about risk factors for rPSC or disease course in children.We retrospectively evaluated risk factors for rPSC in 140 children from the Pediatric PSC Consortium, a multicenter international registry. Recipients underwent LT for PSC and had >90 days of follow-up. The primary outcome, rPSC, was defined using Graziadei criteria. Median follow-up after LT was 3 years (interquartile range 1.1-6.1). rPSC occurred in 36 children, representing 10% and 27% of the subjects at 2 years and 5 years following LT, respectively. Subjects with rPSC were younger at LT (12.9 vs. 16.2 years), had faster progression from PSC diagnosis to LT (2.5 vs. 4.1 years), and had higher alanine aminotransferase (112 vs. 66 IU/L) at LT (all P < 0.01). Inflammatory bowel disease was more prevalent in the rPSC group (86% vs. 66%; P = 0.025). After LT, rPSC subjects had more episodes of biopsy-proved acute rejection (mean 3 vs. 1; P < 0.001), and higher prevalence of steroid-refractory rejection (41% vs. 20%; P = 0.04). In those with rPSC, 43% developed complications of portal hypertension, were relisted for LT, or died within 2 years of the diagnosis. Mortality was higher in the rPSC group (11.1% vs. 2.9%; P = 0.05).The incidence of rPSC in this cohort was higher than previously reported, and was associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Patients with rPSC appeared to have a more aggressive, immune-reactive phenotype. These findings underscore the need to understand the immune mechanisms of rPSC, to lay the foundation for developing new therapies and improve outcomes in this challenging population.© 2021 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.

  Title: Hypophosphatemia after high-dose intravenous iron treatment in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: Mechanisms and possible clinical impact.
  Abstract: High-dose intravenous iron is an effective treatment option for iron deficiency (ID) or ID anaemia (IDA) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, treatment with ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) has been associated with the development of hypophosphatemia.To investigate mechanisms behind the development of hypophosphatemia after intravenous iron treatment, and disclose symptoms and clinical manifestations related to hypophosphatemia short-term.A prospective observational study of adult IBD patients with ID or IDA was conducted between February 1, 2017 and July 1, 2018 at two separate university hospitals in the southeast region of Norway. Patients received one dose of 1000 mg of either FCM or ferric derisomaltose (FDI) and were followed for an observation period of at least 7 wk. Blood and urine samples were collected for relevant analyses at baseline, week 2 and at week 6. Clinical symptoms were assessed at the same timepoints using a respiratory function test, a visual analogue scale, and a health-related quality of life questionnaire.A total of 106 patients was available for analysis in this study. The FCM treatment group consisted of 52 patients and hypophosphatemia was present in 72.5% of the patients at week 2, and in 21.6% at week 6. In comparison, the FDI treatment group consisted of 54 patients and 11.3% of the patients had hypophosphatemia at week 2, and 3.7% at week 6. The difference in incidence was highly significant at both week 2 and 6 (P < 0.001 and P < 0.013, respectively). We observed a significantly higher mean concentration of intact fibroblast growth factor 23 (P < 0.001), a significant rise in mean urine fractional excretion of phosphate (P = 0.004), a significant decrease of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (P < 0.001) and of ionised calcium levels (P < 0.012) in the FCM-treated patients compared with patients who received FDI. No clinical symptoms could with certainty be related to hypophosphatemia, since neither the respiratory function test, SF-36 (36-item short form health survey) or the visual analogue scale scores resulted in significant differences between patients who developed hypophosphatemia or not.Fibroblast growth factor 23 has a key role in FCM induced hypophosphatemia, probably by inducing loss of phosphate in the urine. Short-term clinical impact of hypophosphatemia was not demonstrated.©The Author(s) 2021. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved.

  Title: Serum levels of selected micronutrients in patients with inflammatory bowel disease in clinical remission.
  Abstract: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can experience micronutrient deficiency regardless of disease activity and extent.We aimed to evaluate serum concentrations of selected trace elements in adult patients with IBD in clinical remission with involvement limited to the colon who received immunosuppressive treatment.We enrolled 32 patients with IBD (mean [SD] age, 41 [15.2] years) and 30 healthy controls (mean [SD] age, 39.1 [11.8] years). Serum selenium, iron, copper, and zinc levels as well as complete blood count were measured in both groups.Patients with IBD had lower zinc concentrations than controls (mean [SD], 0.76 [0.13] mg/l vs 0.83 [0.13] mg/l; P = 0.047). No differences were observed for selenium (mean [SD], 0.90 [0.24] μmol/l vs 0.93 [0.19] μmol/l) and copper levels (mean [SD], 1.03 [0.27] mg/l vs 0.97 [0.22] mg/l). Compared with controls, patients with IBD had lower red blood cell count (mean [SD], 4.4 [0.6] 106/μl vs 4.7 [0.4] 106/μl; P = 0.03), hemoglobin (mean [SD], 12.7 [2.2] g/dl vs 14.3 [0.8] g/dl; P = 0.001), and iron levels (mean [SD], 14.2 [9.4] μmol/l vs 23.4 [2.7] μmol/l; P = 0.0001). Patients with IBD showed a positive correlation between selenium and iron (R = 0.499; P = 0.004) as well as selenium and hemoglobin levels (R = 0.579; P = 0.001).Patients with IBD, despite maintaining clinical remission, should undergo systematic laboratory test for anemia or micronutrient deficiencies.

  Title: G-protein coupled receptor 35 (GPR35) regulates the colonic epithelial cell response to enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis.
  Abstract: G protein-coupled receptor (GPR)35 is highly expressed in the gastro-intestinal tract, predominantly in colon epithelial cells (CEC), and has been associated with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), suggesting a role in gastrointestinal inflammation. The enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) toxin (BFT) is an important virulence factor causing gut inflammation in humans and animal models. We identified that BFT signals through GPR35. Blocking GPR35 function in CECs using the GPR35 antagonist ML145, in conjunction with shRNA knock-down and CRISPRcas-mediated knock-out, resulted in reduced CEC-response to BFT as measured by E-cadherin cleavage, beta-arrestin recruitment and IL-8 secretion. Importantly, GPR35 is required for the rapid onset of ETBF-induced colitis in mouse models. GPR35-deficient mice showed reduced death and disease severity compared to wild-type C57Bl6 mice. Our data support a role for GPR35 in the CEC and mucosal response to BFT and underscore the importance of this molecule for sensing ETBF in the colon.

  Title: Adalimumab biosimilars, ABP501 and SB5, are equally effective and safe as adalimumab originator.
  Abstract: To date, data on effectiveness and safety of Adalimumab (ADA) biosimilars in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are lacking. Therefore, we aimed to verify the ability of ABP501 and SB5 to maintain the clinical and biochemical response induced by the ADA originator, after switching to them. We prospectively analyzed data collected from 55 patients with IBD who switched to ABP501, and 25 patients with IBD who switched to SB5, from ADA originator at four IBD Units between 2018 and 2020. In addition, we included an age and sex-matched control group (n = 38) who continued ADA originator for at least two years and who did not switch to a biosimilar drug. Clinical and biochemical data (C-Reactive Protein (CRP), fecal calprotectin (FC)), concomitant steroid and/or immunosuppressant therapy at the time of the switch and after six months were collected. At six months, in the ABP501 group, we did not observe statistically significant modifications in clinical activity of disease (p = 0.09) and FC values (p = 0.90). Some patients (n = 8) needed to add steroids at six months after switching (p = 0.01), however the need for optimization was not significant between the two timepoints (p = 0.70). Finally, 14.5% patients stopped therapy after six months. Similarly, in the SB5 group we observed a stability of clinical activity and FC values (p = 0.90 and p = 0.20), and a concomitant statistically significant decrease in CRP (p = 0.03). There were no differences in steroids/immunosuppressants need or optimizing biological therapy in this group. Finally, drug survival curves of patients who switched from originator to ABP501 and those who continued ADA originator were similar (p = 0.20). Overall, biosimilar drugs seem to be as effective and safe as the originator. Further larger and longer studies are mandatory to understand the clinical implications of these findings.

Similarly, in the SB5 group we observed a stability of clinical activity and FC values (p = 0.90 and p = 0.20), and a concomitant statistically significant decrease in CRP (p = 0.03). There were no differences in steroids/immunosuppressants need or optimizing biological therapy in this group. Finally, drug survival curves of patients who switched from originator to ABP501 and those who continued ADA originator were similar (p = 0.20). Overall, biosimilar drugs seem to be as effective and safe as the originator. Further larger and longer studies are mandatory to understand the clinical implications of these findings.

  Title: Food antigens exacerbate intestinal damage and inflammation following the disruption of the mucosal barrier.
  Abstract: Food antigens are closely related to progression of inflammatory bowel disease; however, details of how they induce intestinal immune responses and causes intestinal inflammation is not yet clear. The present study aimed to examine the effects of oral collagen on the intestinal mucosa, and elucidate the mechanism of food antigen-induced enteritis. Here, we provide evidence that Aspirin (a mucosal-damaging agent) and type II collagen (CII; a food antigen) acted synergistically to disrupt the intestinal mucosal barrier, and increase intestinal permeability, which resulted in a large amount of CII entered into the lamina propria, where it interacted with the intestinal immune system, promoted intestinal inflammation, and shaped innate and adaptive immune reactions into Th1-dominant. The underlying mechanism of the CII-induced intestinal inflammation may associate with higher levels of Th1, TLR2 and TLR4, and lower levels of Th2 in the intestine of Aspirin + CII treated rats. The study indicate that compromised integrity of the intestinal barrier appears to be a prerequisite for CII-induced intestinal inflammation. The synergistic effect of food antigens and mucosal barrier injury is an important cause of intestinal inflammation. This new understanding the role of food antigen on intestinal inflammation will provide us with a new strategy for treatment and prevention of intestinal inflammation.Copyright © 2021.

  Title: IL-6 deficiency promotes colitis by recruiting Ly6Chi monocytes into inflamed colon tissues in a CCL2-CCR2-dependent manner.
  Abstract: Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine that is elevated in inflammatory bowel disease. However, the role of IL-6 deficiency in colitis is not well-defined. Some IL-6 and IL-6 receptor antagonists are associated with severe gastrointestinal immune adverse effects, but the mechanisms of the effects are not clear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of IL-6 in ulcerative colitis in Il6-/- mice. Results indicated that physiological deficiency of IL-6 promoted the development of colitis. Moreover, IL-6 deficiency significantly increased the mRNA levels of monocytes chemokine Ccl2 and its receptor Ccr2 in colon tissues. Similarly, the percentage of Ly6Chigh monocytes and neutrophils were increased in the colon of Il6-/- mice. Intestinal crypts more strongly increased the migration of Il6-/- macrophages than wild-type ones. Moreover, Il6-/- macrophages promoted the migration of neutrophils. Most importantly, RS102895, an antagonist of CCR2, diminished chemotaxis of macrophages and inhibited colitis in Il6-/- mice. Collectively, these results indicate that Il6-/- macrophages migrate to inflamed colon tissues and recruit neutrophils, thereby promoting the effect of Il6-/- on colitis. This study expands our understanding on the effect of IL-6 deficiency in colitis and the development of gastrointestinal immune adverse effects.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

  Title: Spatiotemporal regulation of galectin-1-induced T-cell death in lamina propria from Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is characterized by chronic, relapsing intestinal inflammation. Galectin-1 (Gal-1) is an endogenous lectin with key pro-resolving roles, including induction of T-cell apoptosis and secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines. Despite considerable progress, the relevance of Gal-1-induced T-cell death in inflamed tissue from human IBD patients has not been ascertained. Intestinal biopsies and surgical specimens from control patients (n = 52) and patients with active or inactive IBD (n = 97) were studied. Gal-1 expression was studied by RT-qPCR, immunoblotting, ELISA and immunohistochemistry. Gal-1-specific ligands and Gal-1-induced apoptosis of lamina propria (LP) T-cells were determined by TUNEL and flow cytometry. We found a transient expression of asialo core 1-O-glycans in LP T-cells from inflamed areas (p < 0.05) as revealed by flow cytometry using peanut agglutinin (PNA) binding and assessing dysregulation of the core-2 β 1-6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (C2GNT1), an enzyme responsible for elongation of core 2 O-glycans. Consequently, Gal-1 binding was attenuated in CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ LP T-cells isolated from inflamed sites (p < 0.05). Incubation with recombinant Gal-1 induced apoptosis of LP CD3+ T-cells isolated from control subjects and non-inflamed areas of IBD patients (p < 0.05), but not from inflamed areas. In conclusion, our findings showed that transient regulation of the O-glycan profile during inflammation modulates Gal-1 binding and LP T-cell survival in IBD patients.

  Title: CCR6-CCL20 axis as a therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases.
  Abstract: Chemokine receptor CCR6 is expressed on various cells such as B cells, immature dendritic cells, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), regulatory CD4 T cells, and Th17 cells. CCL20 is the only known high-affinity ligand that binds to CCR6 and drives CCR6+ cells' migration in tissues. CCL20 is mainly produced by epithelial cells, and its expression is increased by several folds under inflammatory conditions. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), psoriasis (PS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and multiple sclerosis (MS) showed a very strong correlation between the expression of CCR6 and disease severity. It has been shown that disruption of CCR6-CCL20 interaction by using antibodies or antagonists prevents the migration of CCR6 expressing immune cells at the site of inflammation and reduces the severity of the disease. This review discussed the importance of the CCR6-CCL20 axis in IBD, PS, RA, and MS, and recent advances in targeting the CCR6-CCL20 in controlling these autoimmune diseases.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

  Title: Phlorizin attenuates visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability in a rat model of irritable bowel syndrome.
  Abstract: Visceral hypersensitivity and impaired gut barrier are crucial contributors to the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and those are mediated via corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-Toll like receptor 4-pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling. Phlorizin is an inhibitor of sodium-linked glucose transporters (SGLTs), and known to have anti-cytokine properties. Thus, we hypothesized that phlorizin may improve these gastrointestinal changes in IBS, and tested this hypothesis in rat IBS models, i.e., lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or CRF-induced visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability. The visceral pain threshold in response to colonic balloon distention was estimated by abdominal muscle contractions by electromyogram, and colonic permeability was measured by quantifying the absorbed Evans blue in colonic tissue. Subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of phlorizin inhibited visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability induced by LPS in a dose-dependent manner. Phlorizin also blocked CRF-induced these gastrointestinal changes. Phlorizin is known to inhibit both SGLT1 and SGLT2, but intragastric administration of phlorizin may only inhibit SGLT1 because gut mainly expresses SGLT1. We found that intragastric phlorizin did not display any effects, but ipragliflozin, an orally active and selective SGLT2 inhibitor improved the gastrointestinal changes in the LPS model. Compound C, an adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a nitric oxide (NO) synthesis inhibitor and naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist reversed the effects of phlorizin. In conclusions, phlorizin improved visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability in IBS models. These effects may result from inhibition of SGLT2, and were mediated via AMPK, NO and opioid pathways. Phlorizin may be effective for the treatment of IBS.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

  Title: Leucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein is a potential biomarker to monitor disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease receiving adalimumab: PLANET study.
  Abstract: This multicenter prospective study (UMIN000019958) aimed to evaluate the usefulness of serum leucin-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein (LRG) levels in monitoring disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Patients with moderate-to-severe IBD initiated on adalimumab therapy were enrolled herein. Serum LRG, C-reactive protein (CRP), and fecal calprotectin (fCal) levels were measured at week 0, 12, 24, and 52. Colonoscopy was performed at week 0, 12, and 52 for ulcerative colitis (UC), and at week 0, 24, and 52 for Crohn's disease (CD). Endoscopic activity was assessed using the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) for CD and the Mayo endoscopic subscore (MES) for UC.A total of 81 patients was enrolled. Serum LRG levels decreased along with improvements in clinical and endoscopic outcomes upon adalimumab treatment (27.4 ± 12.6 μg/ml at week 0, 15.5 ± 7.7 μg/ml at week 12, 15.7 ± 9.6 μg/ml at week 24, and 14.5 ± 6.8 μg/ml at week 52), being correlated with endoscopic activity at each time point (SES-CD: r = 0.391 at week 0, r = 0.563 at week 24, r = 0.697 at week 52; MES: r = 0.534 at week 0, r = 0.429 at week 12, r = 0.335 at week 52). Endoscopic activity better correlated with LRG compared to CRP and fCal on pooled analysis at all time points (SES-CD: LRG: r = 0.636, CRP: r = 0.402, fCal: r = 0.435; MES: LRG: r = 0.568, CRP: 0.389, fCal: r = 0.426).Serum LRG is a useful biomarker of endoscopic activity both in CD and UC during the adalimumab treatment.

  Title: Factors associated with reduced infliximab exposure in the treatment of pediatric autoimmune disorders: a cross-sectional prospective convenience sampling study.
  Abstract: Inadequate systemic exposure to infliximab (IFX) is associated with treatment failure. This work evaluated factors associated with reduced IFX exposure in children with autoimmune disorders requiring IFX therapy.In this single-center cross-sectional prospective study IFX trough concentrations and anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) were measured in serum from children diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (n = 73), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) (n = 16), or uveitis (n = 8) receiving maintenance IFX infusions at an outpatient infusion clinic in a tertiary academic pediatric hospital. IFX concentrations in combination with population pharmacokinetic modeling were used to estimate IFX clearance. Patient demographic and clinical data were collected by chart review and evaluated for their relationship with IFX clearance.IFX trough concentrations ranged from 0 to > 40 μg/mL and were 3-fold lower in children with IBD compared to children with JIA (p = 0.0002) or uveitis (p = 0.001). Children with IBD were found to receive lower IFX doses with longer dosing intervals, resulting in dose intensities (mg/kg/day) that were 2-fold lower compared to children with JIA (p = 0.0002) or uveitis (p = 0.02). Use of population pharmacokinetic analysis to normalize for variation in dosing practices demonstrated that increased IFX clearance was associated with ADA positivity (p = 0.004), male gender (p = 0.02), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (p = 0.02), elevated c-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.001), reduced serum albumin concentrations (p = 0.0005), and increased disease activity in JIA (p = 0.009) and IBD (p ≤ 0.08). No significant relationship between diagnosis and underlying differences in IFX clearance was observed. Multivariable analysis by covariate population pharmacokinetic modeling confirmed increased IFX clearance to be associated with anti-IFX antibody positivity, increased ESR, and reduced serum albumin concentrations.Enhanced IFX clearance is associated with immunogenicity and inflammatory burden across autoimmune disorders. Higher systemic IFX exposures observed in children with rheumatologic disorders are driven primarily by provider drug dose and interval selection, rather than differences in IFX pharmacokinetics across diagnoses. Despite maintenance IFX dosing at or above the standard recommended range for IBD (i.e., 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks), the dosing intensity used in the treatment of IBD is notably lower than dosing intensities used to treat JIA and uveitis, and may place some children with IBD at risk for suboptimal maintenance IFX exposures necessary for treatment response.

  Title: Costunolide ameliorates colitis via specific inhibition of HIF1α/glycolysis-mediated Th17 differentiation.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic idiopathic inflammatory disorder of colon. Costunolide, the main active constituent of Radix Aucklandiae, has been demonstrated to possess anti-inflammatory and immunomodulation activities. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of costunolide on UC induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Results showed that oral administration of costunolide significantly improved the disease active index (DAI), rescued the reduction of colon length, downregulated myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, alleviated the pathological changes, and decreased the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in colons of colitis mice. Costunolide also rebalanced Th17/Treg cells in colons, mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen, as indicated by decreased percentages of Th17 cells and reduced mRNA expressions of Rorc, Il17a. Interestingly, the in vitro experiment showed that no significant change in dendritic cell maturation, mRNA expressions of Ifng, Il6 and Treg cell differentiation, but a significant decreased Th17 cell differentiation was observed upon costunolide treatment. Deeper mechanistic studies showed that costunolide triggered the prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2)-triggered proline hydroxylation-ubiquitination-proteasome degradation of HIF-1α, which in turn inactivated glycolytic process in Th17 rather than Treg cells. These findings clearly suggest that inhibition of HIF-1α-mediated glycolysis by costunolide is specifically responsible for Th17 cell differentiation and subsequent alleviation of UC and sets the stage for a new perspective on immune-metabolism therapy for colitis.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

  Title: Higher Postinduction Infliximab Concentrations Are Associated With Improved Clinical Outcomes in Fistulizing Crohn's Disease: An ACCENT-II Post Hoc Analysis.
  Abstract: There are only limited data regarding the role of therapeutic drug monitoring in fistulizing Crohn's disease (CD). We investigated the association between both induction and maintenance serum infliximab concentrations and favorable therapeutic outcomes in patients with fistulizing CD.This was a post hoc analysis of the ACCENT-II trial evaluating patients with fistulizing CD receiving induction (n = 282) and maintenance infliximab therapy (n = 139). Investigated therapeutic outcomes at both week 14 and week 54 included fistula response, complete fistula response, C-reactive protein (CRP) normalization (≤5 mg/L) in patients with an elevated baseline CRP, and a more stringent outcome of composite remission, defined as combined complete fistula response and CRP normalization. Associations between serum infliximab concentrations and outcomes were assessed by multivariable logistic regression models.Higher week 14 infliximab concentrations were independently associated with week 14 fistula response (odds ratio [OR]: 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.32; P = 0.019), and composite remission (OR: 2.32; 95% CI: 1.55-3.49; P < 0.001). Higher week 14 infliximab concentrations were also independently associated with week 54 composite remission (OR: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.10-3.82; P = 0.023). Based on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, week 14 infliximab concentrations thresholds with combined maximal sensitivity and specificity of ≥20.2 μg/mL at week 2, ≥15 μg/mL at week 6, and ≥7.2 μg/mL at week 14 were associated with week 14 composite remission.Higher post-induction infliximab concentrations are associated with early and long-term favorable therapeutic outcomes in patients with fistulizing CD.Copyright © 2021 by The American College of Gastroenterology.

  Title: Xanthine oxidase activity in thiopurine curative Chinese inflammatory bowel disease patients.
  Abstract: Xanthine oxidase (XO) competes with thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) and hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) to metabolize azathioprine (AZA)/6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) in vivo. A retrospective investigation was performed to detect the activity of XO in thiopurine curative Chinese inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. We also evaluated whether a relationship between XO activity and incidence of thiopurine-induced adverse effects (AEs) existed. Clinical data and blood samples were collected from 140 IBD patients before receiving AZA/6-MP therapy, and the erythrocyte XO activity was measured. The XO activities of all patients were 20.29 ± 4.43 U/g Hb. No sex difference in XO activity was observed (p = .728), and the XO activity showed no difference between the UC and CD patients (p = .082). AEs were observed in 41 (29.3%) patients including leukopenia (26, 18.57%), gastrointestinal intolerance (11, 7.86%), flu-like symptom (5, 3.57%), alopecia (5, 3.57%), and hepatotoxicity (1, 0.71%). XO activity was significantly lower in the patients with AEs than in those without AEs (18.40 ± 3.73 vs. 21.07 ± 4.48 U/g Hb, p = .001), especially in the patients with leukopenia (18.29 ± 3.68 vs. 21.07 ± 4.48 U/g Hb, p = .004). However, no significant difference in XO activity was found between patients with and without other AEs. Decreased XO activity was observed in the patients who developed flu-like symptoms (17.58 ± 3.50 U/g Hb) and alopecia (18.67 ± 2.91 U/g Hb) compared to those who did not, although the differences did not reach statistical significance. These findings suggested that patients with low XO expression might have a high risk of thiopurine-induced toxicity.© 2021 The Authors.

  Title: Serum N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen as a biomarker for predicting bone density loss in patients with Crohn disease.
  Abstract: The serum N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (NTx) is significantly higher in patients with Crohn disease (CD) than in healthy individuals and patients with ulcerative colitis. This study aimed to investigate whether an elevated serum NTx level is a risk predictor of osteoporosis in patients with CD.Based on whether the femoral Z-score decreased over a 2-year period, 41 CD patients were divided into the ΔZ-score <0 group (Z-score decreased) and the ΔZ-score ≥0 group (Z-score did not decrease). The risk predictors of a femoral Z-score decrease were examined. Furthermore, we investigated the correlations between the ΔZ-score (which represents the change in the Z-score over a 2-year period) and the mean levels of biomarkers, including the Crohn Disease Activity Index (CDAI), serum albumin, C-reactive protein, and bone metabolism markers (including NTx) measured initially (i.e., in our previous study) and 2 years later (present study). The relationships between anti-tumor necrosis factor α (anti-TNF-α) therapy and serum NTx levels were also examined.Although there was no correlation between the mean CDAI and the ΔZ-score, the mean serum NTx and albumin levels were significantly correlated with the ΔZ-score (P<0.01 and P = 0.02, respectively). Furthermore, the femoral Z-score tended to be lower in the anti-TNF-α administration group than in the non-administration group.These observations indicated that an elevated serum NTx could be a useful marker for predicting a decrease in the femoral bone mineral density in CD patients. Anti-TNF-α therapy maintained an elevated serum NTx level, suggesting that treatment with anti-TNF-α may help control increased bone resorption in CD patients.

The relationships between anti-tumor necrosis factor α (anti-TNF-α) therapy and serum NTx levels were also examined.Although there was no correlation between the mean CDAI and the ΔZ-score, the mean serum NTx and albumin levels were significantly correlated with the ΔZ-score (P<0.01 and P = 0.02, respectively). Furthermore, the femoral Z-score tended to be lower in the anti-TNF-α administration group than in the non-administration group.These observations indicated that an elevated serum NTx could be a useful marker for predicting a decrease in the femoral bone mineral density in CD patients. Anti-TNF-α therapy maintained an elevated serum NTx level, suggesting that treatment with anti-TNF-α may help control increased bone resorption in CD patients.

  Title: Suppressing Kv1.3 Ion Channel Activity with a Novel Small Molecule Inhibitor Ameliorates Inflammation in a Humanised Mouse Model of Ulcerative Colitis.
  Abstract: The potassium channel Kv1.3 is a potentially attractive therapeutic target in T cell-mediated inflammatory diseases, as the activity of antigen-activated T cells is selectively impeded by Kv1.3 inhibition. In this study, we examined Kv1.3 as a potential therapeutic intervention point for ulcerative colitis [UC], and studied the efficacy of DES1, a small-molecule inhibitor of Kv1.3, in vitro and in vivo.Kv1.3 expression on T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs] isolated from donors with and without UC was examined by flow cytometry. In biopsies from UC patients, Kv1.3-expressing CD4+ T cells were detected by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. In vitro, we determined the ability of DES1 to inhibit anti-CD3-driven activation of T cells. In vivo, the efficacy of DES1 was determined in a humanised mouse model of UC and compared with infliximab and tofacitinib in head-to-head studies.Kv1.3 expression was elevated in PBMCs from UC patients and correlated with the prevalence of TH1 and TH2 T cells. Kv1.3 expression was also detected on T cells from biopsies of UC patients. In vitro, DES1 suppressed anti-CD3-driven activation of T cells in a concentration-dependent manner. In vivo, DES1 significantly ameliorated inflammation in the UC model and most effectively so when PBMCs from donors with higher levels of activated T cells were selected for reconstitution. The efficacy of DES1 was comparable to that of either infliximab or tofacitinib.Inhibition of Kv1.3 [by DES1, for instance] appears to be a potential therapeutic intervention strategy for UC patients.© The Author(s) 2021.

  Title: Redox imbalance in Crohn's disease patients is modulated by Azathioprine.
  Abstract: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease without a specific cause. Inflammation in these patients can disturb the oxidants/antioxidants balance and results in oxidative stress that plays a destructive role. This study aimed to evaluate the gene expression of sod1, sod2, cat, nrf2 and gp91phox in CD patients before and after Azathioprine (Aza) consumption.Peripheral bloodmononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated from CD patients (n= 15, mean age = 33.6 ± 1.8) before and after treatment with Aza and healthy controls (n= 15, mean age = 31.5 ± 1.2). The expression levels of sod1, sod2, cat, nrf2 and gp91phox were measured in byusing real-time qRT-PCR technique.The expression levels of gp91phox (P-value < 0.001), cat (P-value < 0.05), sod1 (P-value < 0.001), nrf2 (P-value < 0.001) were significantly increased compared to control group. Following treatment with Aza, the decreased expression levels of gp91phox (P-value < 0.05), cat (P-value < 0.05), sod1(P-value < 0.001) and nrf2 (P-value < 0.001) were observed in CD patients.Overall, our results showed that prescription of Azathioprine can lead to the altered expression of redox system-related genes in patients with CD.

  Title: Role of the IL23/IL17 Pathway in Crohn's Disease.
  Abstract: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing disorder of the gastrointestinal tract and represents one of the main entities of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). CD affects genetically susceptible patients that are influenced by environmental factors and the intestinal microbiome, which results in excessive activation of the mucosal immune system and aberrant cytokine responses. Various studies have implicated the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL17 and IL23 in the pathogenesis of CD. IL23 is a member of the IL12 family of cytokines and is able to enhance and affect the expansion of pathogenic T helper type 17 (Th17) cells through various mechanisms, including maintenance of Th17 signature genes, upregulation of effector genes or suppression of repressive factors. Moreover, IL17 and IL23 signaling is able to induce a cascade of pro-inflammatory molecules like TNF, IFNγ, IL22, lymphotoxin, IL1β and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Here, IL17A and TNF are known to mediate signaling synergistically to drive expression of inflammatory genes. Recent advances in understanding the immunopathogenetic mechanisms underlying CD have led to the development of new biological therapies that selectively intervene and inhibit inflammatory processes caused by pro-inflammatory mediators like IL17 and IL23. Recently published data demonstrate that treatment with selective IL23 inhibitors lead to markedly high response rates in the cohort of CD patients that failed previous anti-TNF therapy. Macrophages are considered as a main source of IL23 in the intestine and are supposed to play a key role in the molecular crosstalk with T cell subsets and innate lymphoid cells in the gut. The following review focuses on mechanisms, pathways and specific therapies in Crohn's disease underlying the IL23/IL17 pathway.Copyright © 2021 Schmitt, Neurath and Atreya.

  Title: Maternal mesalazine-induced neonatal gastrointestinal bleeding.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis often develops in the reproductive age women and can cause exacerbation by pregnancy. Mesalazine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is recommended as a safe anti-inflammatory drug during pregnancy. However, maternal mesalazine is transferred to the fetus through the placenta and may cause allergic events. A pregnant woman with severe ulcerative colitis was treated with a dose of mesalazine 4,000 mg/day from early gestation to delivery. Immediately after birth, the preterm neonate vomited bloody contents and discharged massive gross haematochezia. Serum concentrations of mesalazine and its main metabolite were high in the mother and the umbilical cord. Faecal eosinophils and drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test suggested possibility that sensitisation with mesalazine in utero caused allergic enterocolitis like food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis. Maternal mesalazine has a potential of fetal sensitisation and cause allergic disease.© BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2021. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ.

  Title: Randomised clinical trial: Efficacy and safety of Qing-Chang-Hua-Shi granules in a multicenter, randomized, and double-blind clinical trial of patients with moderately active ulcerative colitis.
  Abstract: Qing-Chang-Hua-Shi (QCHS) is a Chinese herbal formula, which is composed of 11 herbs. Studies have also shown that QCHS granules can alleviate colitis in animal models by preventing inflammatory responses and suppressing apoptosis through the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. To determine the efficacy and safety of QCHS granules in patients with moderately active UC. We performed a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of patients with moderately active UC who did not respond to 4 weeks of mesalazine therapy at the maximum dose. Patients were randomly assigned to groups and administered QCHS granules (125 g/day, n = 59) or an identical placebo, which was similar to the QCHS granules in color and taste (125 g/day, n = 60), with continued 5-ASA 4 g/d therapy for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of clinical response and clinical remission at week 12. The secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life, endoscopic response rate, and mucosal healing rate. Any changes in mucus/bloody stool and diarrhea were recorded. Out of the 119 enrolled patients at 10 different centers in China, 102 patients completed the trial. Clinical remission and clinical response were seen in 31.48% and 92.59% of QCHS-treated patients, and 12.50% and 72.92% of placebo-treated patients, respectively. There was a significant difference between the two treatment groups. More patients receiving QCHS granules vs. placebo achieved remission of mucus/bloody stool (70.37% vs. 47.92%, P = 0.0361). Adverse event rates were similar (QCHS granules 38.33%; placebo 25.42%). In conclusion, QCHS granules were superior to the placebo in introducing clinical remission and mucosal healing, as well as in relieving mucus/blood stool in patients with moderately active and 5-ASA-refractory UC.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

  Title: Correlation between small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and irritable bowel syndrome and the prognosis of treatment.
  Abstract: The aim of the present study was to analyze the relationship between small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and the prognosis of treatment.A total of127 IBS patients (IBS group) were selected, and based on the results of the methane/hydrogen breath test, they were divided into SIBO-positive group (subdivided into the antibiotic group, microecological group, and placebo group according to difference in treatment methods) and the SIBO-negative group. The incidence of SIBO and inflammatory factors in different populations were compared. Moreover, differences in the negative conversion rate of intestinal bacterial overgrowth, symptom improvement, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-10 levels in the antibiotic group, microecological group, and placebo group before and after treatment were compared.The IL-1β level of the IBS group was higher than that of the control group, but the level of IL-10 was lower than that of the control group (P<0.05). The level of IL-1β in the SIBO-positive group was higher than that in the SIBO-negative group, while IL-10 level was lower in the SIBO-positive group compared with the SIBO-negative group (P<0.05). Symptom scores after treatment in the antibiotic group and the microecological group were lower than those in the same groups before treatment and those in the placebo group after treatment (P<0.05). After treatment, the level of IL-1β in the antibiotic group and the microecological group decreased, whereas the level of IL-10 increased (P<0.05). Furthermore, the total clinical effective rate and negative conversion rate of the antibiotic group and the microecological group were higher than those of the placebo group (P<0.05); however, the comparison of symptom scores, inflammatory factors, and total clinical effective rate before and after treatment in the placebo group was not statistically significant (P<0.05). The symptom score after treatment in the negative conversion group was lower than that in the non-negative conversion group (P<0.05).SIBO plays an important role in the occurrence of IBS. Antibiotics and microecological agents can be used to correct SIBO in clinical practice to improve the symptoms of IBS patients and peripheral blood inflammatory factors.

  Title: Potassium bromate (KBrO3) modulates oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers in sodium hydroxide (NaOH) - induced Crohn's colitis in Wistar rats.
  Abstract: Potassium bromate (KBrO3) present in consumed ozonised water was recently documented to exacerbate experimental gastric ulcer. Information, however, is vague as regards its effects in the colon where water reabsorption occurs. In this study, we observed the possible effects of KBrO3 on oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers in sodium hydroxide (NaOH) - induced Crohn's colitis (CC). Wistar rats (180-200 g) were divided into six groups (n = 10): (i) control; (ii) untreated CC (induced by 1.4% NaOH; intra-rectal administration); and (iii-vi) CC treated with vitamin E, KBrO3, vitamin E+KBrO3, and sulphazalazine, respectively, for 7 days. Body weight and stool score were monitored daily. By day 3 and 7, excised colon was evaluated for ulcer scores and biochemical and histological analysis. Blood samples collected on days 3 and 7 were assayed for haematological indices using standard methods. Data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) and p ≤ 0.05 considered significant. Platelet/lymphocyte ratio, colonic ulcer score, malondialdehyde, and mast cells were significantly decreased while colonic sulfhydryl, and Ca2+- and Na+/K+-ATPase activities were increased following KBrO3 treatment compared with untreated CC. These findings suggest that KBrO3 may mitigate against NaOH-induced CC via inhibiting mast cell population and oxidative and inflammatory content but stimulating colonic sulfhydryl and Ca2+- and Na+/K+-ATPase activities.

  Title: Network pharmacology dissection of multiscale mechanisms for jiaoqi powder in treating ulcerative colitis.
  Abstract: The incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) is increasing worldwide, making it a serious public health challenge. Currently, there are no accepted curative treatments for UC. As such, the exploration of new therapeutic strategies for UC treatment is of considerable clinical importance. Jiaoqi powder (JQP) is a classic Chinese medicinal formula commonly used as a complementary and alternative medicine for treating gastrointestinal bleeding. JQP is thus a potential alternative medicine for UC treatment. However, the protective mechanism underlying the action of JQP has not been elucidated, thereby, necessitating further studies to decipher the mechanisms involved in the complex interplay among its components.To explore the protective effect of JQP against UC and to further investigate its mechanism in silico and in vivo using a systems pharmacology approach.A systems pharmacology approach was used to predict the active components of JQP. Putative targets and the potential mechanism of JQP on UC were obtained through target fishing, network construction, and enrichment analyses. An animal-based model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in C57BL/6 mice was further used to validate the treatment mechanisms of JQP. The underlying pharmacological mechanisms of JQP in UC were determined using polymerase chain reaction tests, histological staining, immunohistochemistry, enzyme-linked immunoassays, and flow cytometry analysis.In this study, 17 effective components and 941 potential targets of JQP were identified. Similarly, 2104 UC-related targets were also identified. Construction of PPI networks led to the identification of 184 putative therapeutic targets of JQP. Sixty-nine core targets among these 184 were further screened based on their DC values. Gene ontology (GO) functional and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses revealed that the core targets were primarily enriched in immune response and inflammatory signalling pathways. Subsequent animal-based in vivo experiments revealed that JQP ameliorated symptoms and histological changes in DSS colitis by significantly impairing DSS's ability to induce high expression levels of NF-κB/p65, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. JQP also reduced the levels of COX-2, CCL2, CXCL2, HIF-1α, MMP3 and MMP9 and regulated the Th17/Treg cell balance in DSS-induced mice.This study demonstrated that JQP could treat UC by improving the mucosal inflammatory response, repairing the intestinal barrier, and modulating the Th17/Treg immune balance. The results of this study provide new insights into UC treatment and further elucidate the theoretical and practical implications of the pharmaceutical development of TCMs.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

  Title: Dose optimisation for Loss of Response to Vedolizumab- Pharmacokinetics and Immune Mechanisms.
  Abstract: Real life data regarding pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab in patients needing dose optimisation are scarce. We set to examine whether pre-optimisation vedolizumab levels associate with therapy outcomes and which mechanisms explain the associations.A multicentre observational study assessed the outcome of dose increase in association with pre-escalation levels in vedolizumab-treated patients. SubsequentIy, α4β7 occupancy on peripheral blood [PB] and intestinal lamina propria [LP] tissues was investigated on various cellular subsets in patients undergoing lower endoscopy on infusion day. Cellular localisation of vedolizumab-bound α4β7 and effects on M1 and M2 macrophages were also explored.A total of 161 inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] patients were included. Among 129/161 patients intensified during maintenance [Week 14 onward], pre-intensification trough levels were comparable or higher among those subsequently attaining post-optimisation clinical, biomarker, and endoscopic remission, compared with non-remitting patients [p = 0.09, 0.25, 0.04, respectively]. Similar results were demonstrated for those dose-optimised during induction [Week 6, n = 32]. In the immune sub-study [n = 43], free α4β7 receptors at trough were similarly low among patients with/without mucosal healing, on PB T cells [p = 0.15], LP T cells [p = 0.88], and on PB eosinophils [p = 0.08]. Integrin receptors on M1 and M2 macrophages were also saturated by low levels of vedolizumab and anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion was not increased. Co-localisation and dissociation experiments demonstrated membranal α4β7 receptors of two origins: non-internalised and newly generated α4β7, but re-binding was still complete at very low concentrations.These results do not support pharmacokinetics as the mechanism responsible for loss of response to vedolizumab, nor do they support a need for higher drug concentration to enhance vedolizumab's immune effects. Higher pre-escalation levels may indicate less clearance [less severe disease] and higher likelihood of subsequent re-gained response, regardless of therapy escalation.© The Author(s) 2021.

  Title: Acetylcholine ameliorates colitis by promoting IL-10 secretion of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells through the nAChR/ERK pathway.
  Abstract: The alteration of the enteric nervous system (ENS) and its role in neuroimmune modulation remain obscure in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Here, by using the xCell tool and the latest immunolabeling-enabled three-dimensional (3D) imaging of solvent-cleared organs technique, we found severe pathological damage of the entire ENS and decreased expression of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in IBD patients. As a result, acetylcholine (ACh), a major neurotransmitter of the nervous system synthesized by ChAT, was greatly reduced in colon tissues of both IBD patients and colitis mice. Importantly, administration of ACh via enema remarkably ameliorated colitis, which was proved to be directly dependent on monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs). Furthermore, ACh was demonstrated to promote interleukin-10 secretion of M-MDSCs and suppress the inflammation through activating the nAChR/ERK pathway. The present data reveal that the cholinergic signaling pathway in the ENS is impaired during colitis and uncover an ACh-MDSCs neuroimmune regulatory pathway, which may offer promising therapeutic strategies for IBDs.

  Title: Clinical effects of ursodeoxycholic acid on patients with ulcerative colitis may improve via the regulation of IL-23-IL-17 axis and the changes of the proportion of intestinal microflora.
  Abstract: We aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of additional ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) with mesalazine, compared to mesalazine alone in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). The mechanism was evaluated by monitoring the changes of IL-23-IL-17 axis and the intestinal microflora.In this prospective, single center study, patients with UC were randomly assigned to the Mesalazine group (n=20) or the UDCA + Mesalazine group (n=20). Mayo score and Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), and fecal samples for 16S rRNA sequencing and blood samples for IL-23 and IL-17 ELISA were collected for analysis.Mayo scores and IBDQ score of the UDCA + Mesalazine group were significantly better than those of the Mesalazine group (P = 0.015 and P < 0.001, respectively). At post-treatment week 4, IL-23 and IL-17 levels were significantly lower in the UDCA + Mesalazine group compared to those in the Mesalazine group (both P < 0.038). In patients with UC after treatment, Firmicutes in the UDCA + Mesalazine group was higher than those in the Mesalazine group (P < 0.001). The UDCA + Mesalazine group showed lower percentage of Proteobacteria compared to those in the Mesalazine group (P < 0.001).Additional UDCA could provide better therapeutic effects than mesalazine alone, possibly due to the change of IL-23 and IL-17 and the proportional distribution of intestinal microflora.

  Title: Agonist anti-ChemR23 mAb reduces tissue neutrophil accumulation and triggers chronic inflammation resolution.
  Abstract: Resolution of inflammation is elicited by proresolving lipids, which activate GPCRs to induce neutrophil apoptosis, reduce neutrophil tissue recruitment, and promote macrophage efferocytosis. Transcriptional analyses in up to 300 patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) identified potential therapeutic targets mediating chronic inflammation. We found that ChemR23, a GPCR targeted by resolvin E1, is overexpressed in inflamed colon tissues of severe IBD patients unresponsive to anti-TNFα or anti-α4β7 therapies and associated with significant mucosal neutrophil accumulation. We also identified an anti-ChemR23 agonist antibody that induces receptor signaling, promotes macrophage efferocytosis, and reduces neutrophil apoptosis at the site of inflammation. This ChemR23 mAb accelerated acute inflammation resolution and triggered resolution in ongoing chronic colitis models, with a significant decrease in tissue lesions, fibrosis and inflammation-driven tumors. Our findings suggest that failure of current IBD therapies may be associated with neutrophil infiltration and that ChemR23 is a promising therapeutic target for chronic inflammation.Copyright © 2021 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

  Title: Virtualized clinical studies to assess the natural history and impact of gut microbiome modulation in non-hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 a randomized, open-label, prospective study with a parallel group study evaluating the physiologic effects of KB109 on gut microbiota structure and function: a structured summary of a study protocol for a randomized controlled study.
  Abstract: These 2 parallel studies (K031 and K032) aim to evaluate the safety of KB109 in addition to supportive self-care (SSC) compared with SSC alone in outpatients with mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). KB109 is a novel synthetic glycan that was formulated to modulate the gut microbiome composition and metabolic output in order to increase beneficial short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production in the gut. The K031 study is designed to evaluate the safety of KB109 and characterize its impact on the natural progression of COVID-19 in patients with mild to moderate disease.

  Title: Virtualized clinical studies to assess the natural history and impact of gut microbiome modulation in non-hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 a randomized, open-label, prospective study with a parallel group study evaluating the physiologic effects of KB109 on gut microbiota structure and function: a structured summary of a study protocol for a randomized controlled study.
  Abstract: These 2 parallel studies (K031 and K032) aim to evaluate the safety of KB109 in addition to supportive self-care (SSC) compared with SSC alone in outpatients with mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). KB109 is a novel synthetic glycan that was formulated to modulate the gut microbiome composition and metabolic output in order to increase beneficial short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production in the gut. The K031 study is designed to evaluate the safety of KB109 and characterize its impact on the natural progression of COVID-19 in patients with mild to moderate disease. The K032 study is evaluating the effect of KB109 on the gut microbiota structure and function in this same patient population. Additionally, both studies are evaluating measures of health care utilization, quality of life (QOL), laboratory indices, biomarkers of inflammation, and serological measures of immunity in patients who received SSC alone or with KB109.

  Title: Seven Weeks of High-Dose Vitamin D Treatment Reduces the Need for Infliximab Dose-Escalation and Decreases Inflammatory Markers in Crohn's Disease during One-Year Follow-Up.
  Abstract: Seven weeks of high-dose vitamin D treatment decreases intestinal IL17A and IFN-γ mRNA expression in active Crohn's disease (CD). In this follow-up study, we investigated whether seven-week vitamin D treatment affected the infliximab response in the following 45 weeks compared to placebo.CD patients (n = 40) were initially randomised into four groups: infliximab + vitamin-D; infliximab + placebo-vitamin-D; placebo-infliximab + vitamin-D; and placebo-infliximab + placebo-vitamin-D. Infliximab (5 mg/kg) or placebo-infliximab was administered at weeks 0, 2 and 6. Vitamin D (5 mg bolus followed by 0.5 mg/day for 7 weeks) or placebo-vitamin D was handed out. After the 7-week vitamin D period, all patients received infliximab during follow-up. Results are reported for Group D+ (infliximab + vitamin-D and placebo-infliximab + vitamin-D) and Group D- (infliximab + placebo-vitamin-D and placebo-infliximab + placebo-vitamin-D).Group D- patients had greater needs for infliximab dose escalation during follow-up compared to group D+ (p = 0.05). Group D+ had lower median calprotectin levels week 15 (p = 0.02) and week 23 (p = 0.04) compared to group D-. Throughout follow-up, group D+ had 2.2 times (95% CI: 1.1-4.3) (p = 0.02) lower median CRP levels compared with group D-.Seven weeks high-dose vitamin D treatment reduces the need for later infliximab dose-escalation and reduces inflammatory markers.

  Title: Impaired Butyrate Induced Regulation of T Cell Surface Expression of CTLA-4 in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis.
  Abstract: Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) have reduced intestinal levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including butyrate, which are important regulators of host-microbiota crosstalk. The aim was therefore to determine effects of butyrate on blood and intestinal T cells from patients with active UC. T cells from UC patients and healthy subjects were polyclonally stimulated together with SCFAs and proliferation, activation, cytokine secretion, and surface expression of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) were analyzed. Butyrate induced comparable, dose dependent inhibition of activation and proliferation in blood T cells and activation in intestinal T cells from UC patients and healthy subjects. However, surface expression of the inhibitory molecule CTLA-4 on stimulated blood and intestinal T cells was impaired in UC patients and was not restored following butyrate treatment. Furthermore, unlike intestinal T cells from healthy subjects, butyrate was unable to downregulate secretion of interferon gamma (IFNγ), interleukin (IL)-4, IL-17A, and IL-10 in UC patients. Although seemingly normal inhibitory effects on T cell activation and proliferation, butyrate has an impaired ability to reduce cytokine secretion and induce surface expression of CTLA-4 in T cells from UC patients with active disease. Overall, these observations indicate a dysfunction in butyrate induced immune regulation linked to CTLA-4 signaling in T cells from UC patients during a flare.

  Title: Chrysophanol Attenuates Manifestations of Immune Bowel Diseases by Regulation of Colorectal Cells and T Cells Activation In Vivo.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an immune disorder that develops due to chronic inflammation in several cells. It is known that colorectal and T cells are mainly involved in the pathogenesis of IBD. Chrysophanol is an anthraquinone family member that possesses several bioactivities, including anti-diabetic, anti-tumor, and inhibitory effects on T cell activation. However, it is unknown whether chrysophanol suppresses the activity of colorectal cells. In this study, we found that chrysophanol did not induce cytotoxicity in HT-29 colorectal cells. Pre-treatment with chrysophanol inhibited the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-stimulated HT-29 cells. Western blot analysis revealed that pre-treatment with chrysophanol mitigates p65 translocation and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in activated HT-29 cells. Results from the in vivo experiment confirmed that oral administration of chrysophanol protects mice from dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced IBD. Chrysophanol administration attenuates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in colon tissues of the DSS-induced IBD model. In addition, we found that oral administration of chrysophanol systemically decreased the expression of effector cytokines from mesenteric lymph nodes. Therefore, these data suggest that chrysophanol has a potent modulatory effect on colorectal cells as well as exhibiting a beneficial potential for curing IBD in vivo.

  Title: Influence of Short-Term Consumption of Hericium erinaceus on Serum Biochemical Markers and the Changes of the Gut Microbiota: A Pilot Study.
  Abstract: Hericium erinaceus (H. erinaceus) is widely studied as a medicinal and edible fungus. Recent studies have shown that H. erinaceus has protective effects for diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease and cancer, which are related to gut microbiota. To investigate the benefits of H. erinaceus intake on gut microbiota and blood indices in adulthood, we recruited 13 healthy adults to consume H. erinaceus powder as a dietary supplement. Blood changes due to H. erinaceus consumption were determined by routine hematological examination and characterized by serum biochemical markers. Microbiota composition was profiled by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Results showed that daily H. erinaceus supplementation increased the alpha diversity within the gut microbiota community, upregulated the relative abundance of some short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producing bacteria (Kineothrix alysoides, Gemmiger formicilis, Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans, Eubacterium rectale, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii), and downregulated some pathobionts (Streptococcus thermophilus, Bacteroides caccae, Romboutsia timonensis). Changes within the gut microbiota were correlated with blood chemical indices including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), uric acid (UA), and creatinine (CREA). Thus, we found that the gut microbiota alterations may be part of physiological adaptations to a seven-day H. erinaceus supplementation, potentially influencing beneficial health effects.

  Title: [Effect of acupoint catgut embedding on intestinal mucosal epithelial barrier in ulcerative colitis rats].
  Abstract: To observe the effect of acupoint catgut embedding on intestinal mucosal epithelial injury, and expression of epithelial tight junction proteins and mRNAs and protein kinase C(PKC) protein (intestinal mucosal epithelial barrier-related molecules) in rats with experimental ulcerative colitis (UC) of "deficiency-stasis" type, so as to explore its mechanisms underlying improvement of UC.Male SD rats were randomly divided into normal control, UC model, medication (sulfasalazine, SASP) and catgut-embedding groups. The "deficiency-stasis" type UC model was established by gavage of adenine (10 mL/kg) for 2 weeks, cold Folium Sennae (10 mL/kg) for 2 weeks, and then enema of mixture solution of 5% trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid (100 mg/kg) + 50% ethyl alcohol. Rats of the medication group received gavage of SASP. The catgut-embedment was applied to bilateral "Tianshu"(ST23),"Zusanli"(ST36), "Geshu"(BL17), "Pishu"(BL20), "Shenshu"(BL23) and "Dachangshu"(BL25), once every two weeks, 3 times altogether. The body mass was recorded, and histopathological changes of the colon tissues were observed after H.E. staining. The contents of serum D-lactic acid (D-LA), diamine oxidase (DAO) and protein kinase C (PKC) were detected by ELISA. The expression levels of occludin, claudin-8, cingulin and zonulin mRNAs and proteins and PKC protein of the colon tissues were detected by using quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot, separately.Compared with the control group, the body mass and expression levels of colonic occludin, claudin-8 and cingulin mRNAs and proteins were significantly lower (P<0.01), and the colonic mucosa damage index (CMDI) score, contents of serum D-LA, DAO and PKC, as well as the expression levels of zonulin mRNA and protein and PKC protein were significantly higher in the model group (P<0.01). In comparison with the model group, the body mass, and the expression levels of occludin, claudin-8 and cingulin mRNAs and proteins were significantly higher (P<0.05, P<0.01), whereas the CMDI score, expression levels of zonulin mRNA and protein and PKC protein were remarkably lower in both the medication group and acupoint embedding groups (P<0.05,P<0.01). No significant differences were found between the acupoint embedding and medication groups in all the indexes mentioned above (P>0.05). H.E. staining showed markedly swollen, disordered arrangement of intestinal mucosal cells, and hemorrhage with infiltration of inflammatory cells in the colonic tissues after modeling, which was relatively milder in both medication and acupoint embedding groups.Acupoint catgut embedding can reduce colonic tissue injury in UC rats, which may be related to its functions in regulating the expression of intestinal epithelial tight junction proteins and mRNAs and in inhibiting the activation of PKC protein.

  Title: [Effect of acupoint catgut embedding on intestinal mucosal epithelial barrier in ulcerative colitis rats].
  Abstract: To observe the effect of acupoint catgut embedding on intestinal mucosal epithelial injury, and expression of epithelial tight junction proteins and mRNAs and protein kinase C(PKC) protein (intestinal mucosal epithelial barrier-related molecules) in rats with experimental ulcerative colitis (UC) of "deficiency-stasis" type, so as to explore its mechanisms underlying improvement of UC.Male SD rats were randomly divided into normal control, UC model, medication (sulfasalazine, SASP) and catgut-embedding groups. The "deficiency-stasis" type UC model was established by gavage of adenine (10 mL/kg) for 2 weeks, cold Folium Sennae (10 mL/kg) for 2 weeks, and then enema of mixture solution of 5% trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid (100 mg/kg) + 50% ethyl alcohol. Rats of the medication group received gavage of SASP. The catgut-embedment was applied to bilateral "Tianshu"(ST23),"Zusanli"(ST36), "Geshu"(BL17), "Pishu"(BL20), "Shenshu"(BL23) and "Dachangshu"(BL25), once every two weeks, 3 times altogether. The body mass was recorded, and histopathological changes of the colon tissues were observed after H.E. staining. The contents of serum D-lactic acid (D-LA), diamine oxidase (DAO) and protein kinase C (PKC) were detected by ELISA. The expression levels of occludin, claudin-8, cingulin and zonulin mRNAs and proteins and PKC protein of the colon tissues were detected by using quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot, separately.Compared with the control group, the body mass and expression levels of colonic occludin, claudin-8 and cingulin mRNAs and proteins were significantly lower (P<0.01), and the colonic mucosa damage index (CMDI) score, contents of serum D-LA, DAO and PKC, as well as the expression levels of zonulin mRNA and protein and PKC protein were significantly higher in the model group (P<0.01). In comparison with the model group, the body mass, and the expression levels of occludin, claudin-8 and cingulin mRNAs and proteins were significantly higher (P<0.05, P<0.01), whereas the CMDI score, expression levels of zonulin mRNA and protein and PKC protein were remarkably lower in both the medication group and acupoint embedding groups (P<0.05,P<0.01). No significant differences were found between the acupoint embedding and medication groups in all the indexes mentioned above (P>0.05). H.E. staining showed markedly swollen, disordered arrangement of intestinal mucosal cells, and hemorrhage with infiltration of inflammatory cells in the colonic tissues after modeling, which was relatively milder in both medication and acupoint embedding groups.Acupoint catgut embedding can reduce colonic tissue injury in UC rats, which may be related to its functions in regulating the expression of intestinal epithelial tight junction proteins and mRNAs and in inhibiting the activation of PKC protein.

  Title: Monocyte TREM-1 Levels Associate With Anti-TNF Responsiveness in IBD Through Autophagy and Fcγ-Receptor Signaling Pathways.
  Abstract: The expression of Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells (TREM)-1 has been described as a predictive marker for anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy responsiveness in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here we investigated expression of TREM-1 specifically in CD14+ monocytes in relation to anti-TNF response. The pretreatment TREM-1 expression levels of CD14+ monocytes of Crohn's disease (CD) patients were predictive of outcome to anti-TNF mAb therapy, with low TREM-1 expression associated with response to anti-TNF. FACSorting of CD14+ monocytes with different TREM-1 levels showed that differentiation towards regulatory CD206+ M2 type macrophages by anti-TNF was suppressed in CD14+ monocytes with high TREM-1 expression. Activity of the Fcγ-Receptor and autophagy pathway, both necessary for M2 type differentiation and the response to anti-TNF, were decreased in CD14+ monocytes with high expression of TREM-1. We confirmed that the activity of the Fcγ-Receptor pathway was decreased in the CD patients that did not respond to anti-TNF therapy and that it was negatively correlated with TREM-1 expression levels in the CD patient cohort. In conclusion, our results indicate that TREM-1 expression levels in CD14+ monocytes associate with decreased autophagy and FcγR activity resulting in decreased differentiation to M2 type regulatory macrophages upon anti-TNF mAb treatment, which may explain anti-TNF non-response in IBD patients with high expression levels of TREM-1.Copyright © 2021 Prins, Verstockt, Ferrante, Vermeire, Wildenberg and Koelink.

  Title: Human Cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus specific immunity in patients with ulcerative colitis.
  Abstract: Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are endowed with the ability of establishing lifelong latency in human hosts and reactivating in immunocompromised subjects, including patients suffering from ulcerative colitis (UC). We, therefore, aimed to investigate virus-specific immunity in UC patients. A cohort of 24 UC patients (14 responders and 10 refractory to therapy) and 26 control subjects was prospectively enrolled to undergo virus-specific serology (by ELISA assay) and assessment of both CD4+ and CD8+ virus-specific T-cell response (by interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunospotanalysis). In parallel, mucosal viral load was determined by quantitative real-time PCR and the values were correlated with both clinical and endoscopic indexes of activity. For statistics, the t-test, Mann-Withney test, Fisher's exact test and Spearman rank correlation test were applied; p < 0.05 was considered significant. EBV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses were significantly lower in UC patients compared to controls (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0006, respectively), whereas no difference was found for HCMV-specific T-cell response. When dividing the UC group according to response to therapy, both responders and refractory UC patients showed a deficient EBV-specific CD4+ T-cell response with respect to controls (p < 0.04 and p = 0.0003, respectively). Moreover, both EBV and HCMV mucosal loads were significantly higher in refractory UC than in responders and controls (p = 0.007 and 0.003; and p = 0.02 and 0.001, respectively), and correlated with activity indexes. Steroid therapy seemed the main risk factor for triggering EBV colitis. Finally, no cases of IgM positivity were found in the study population. An impaired EBV-specific immunity was clearly evident in UC patients, mostly in those refractory to therapy. The ELISPOT assay may serve as new tool for quantifying and monitoring virus-specific T-cell immunity in UC.

  Title: Activation of central adenosine A2B receptors mediate brain ghrelin-induced improvement of intestinal barrier function through the vagus nerve in rats.
  Abstract: Leaky gut that is a condition reflecting intestinal barrier dysfunction has been attracting attention for its relations with many diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome or Alzheimer dementia. We have recently demonstrated that ghrelin acts in the brain to improve leaky gut via the vagus nerve. In the present study, we tried to clarify the precise central mechanisms by which ghrelin improves intestinal barrier function through the vagus nerve. Colonic permeability was estimated in vivo by quantifying the absorbed Evans blue in colonic tissue in rats. Adenosine receptor antagonist, 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX), blocked the intracisternal ghrelin-induced improvement of intestinal hyperpermeability while dopamine, cannabinoid or opioid receptor antagonist failed to prevent it. Since DPCPX can block adenosine A1 and adenosine A2B receptors, we examined which subtype is involved in the mechanism. Intracisternal injection of adenosine A2B agonist but not adenosine A1 agonist improved colonic hyperpermeability, while peripheral injection of adenosine A2B agonist failed to improve it. Intracisternal adenosine A2B agonist-induced improvement of colonic hyperpermeability was blocked by vagotomy. Adenosine A2B specific antagonist, alloxazine blocked the ghrelin- or central vagal stimulation by 2-deoxy-d-glucose-induced improvement of intestinal hyperpermeability. These results suggest that activation of adenosine A2B receptors in the central nervous system is capable of improving intestinal barrier function through the vagal pathway, and the adenosine A2B receptors may mediate the ghrelin-induced improvement of leaky gut in a vagal dependent fashion. These findings may help us understand the pathophysiology in not only gastrointestinal diseases but also non-gastrointestinal diseases associated with the altered intestinal permeability.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

  Title: Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells-1 Agonist Regulates Intestinal Inflammation via Cd177+ Neutrophils.
  Abstract: Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell-1 (TREM-1) signaling is expressed on neutrophils and monocytes that is necessary for the successful antimicrobial response and resolution of inflammation in the gut. In this study, we determined the effect of an anti-TREM-1 agonistic antibody (α-TREM-1) on colitis and identify its underlying mechanism of action. Administration of α-TREM-1 alleviated colitis in mice and resolved dysbiosis, which required TLR4/Myd88 signaling. α-TREM-1 increased the production of neutrophil extracellular traps and interleukin-22 by CD177+ neutrophils, which led to pathogen clearance and protection of the intestinal barrier. TREM-1 activation using an α-TREM-1 antibody protects against colitis by rebalancing the microbiota and protecting the epithelium against the immune response as well as modulates the function of neutrophils and macrophages. These results highlight the importance of the TREM-1 pathway in intestinal homeostasis and suggest that α-TREM-1 treatment may be an effective therapeutic strategy for inflammatory bowel disease.Copyright © 2021 Seo, Che, Kim, Kim, Ma, Kim, Kim, Kim, Kim and Cheon.

  Title: Effect of Anti-TNF Therapy on Mucosal Apoptosis Genes Expression in Crohn's Disease.
  Abstract: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated disorder for which there is not a fully effective treatment. Moreover, biological therapy with anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF-α) monoclonal antibodies leads to an effective response in only 60-70% of patients. Our previous data suggested that specific loci polymorphism of the TNFRSF1B, FCGR3A, IL1R, IL1B, and FAS genes could be a predictor of the primary non-response to anti-TNF therapy in CD patients. In this work, we propose to explain this hypothesis by functional analysis in colon biopsies and in a cell culture model. Using the RT-qPCR analysis, we estimated the FCGR3A, IL1R, TNFRSF1B, IL1B, FAS, and ADAM17 genes mRNA level in colon biopsies material from inflamed and non-inflamed tissue from 21 CD patients (14 responders and 7 non-responders to anti-TNF therapy) and 6 controls, as well as in vitro in a peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 14 CD patients (seven responders and seven non-responders to anti-TNF therapy) and eight controls cultured for 72 h with 10 μg/ml of anti-TNF antibody. Our findings demonstrated a significant down-regulation of TNFRSF1B gene expression in non-responders both in inflamed and in non-inflamed colon tissue, while the expression of the FCGR3A and IL1B genes was significantly up-regulated in non-responders in the inflamed colon region. In vitro research results indicate that the anti-TNF drug induced a significant decrease in TNFRSF1B, FCGR3A, and FAS gene expression in non-responders. These results show that altered TNFRSF1B, FCGR3A, and IL1B genes expression can be a predictor of the primary non-response to anti-TNF therapy in CD patients.Copyright © 2021 Lykowska-Szuber, Walczak, Skrzypczak-Zielinska, Suszynska-Zajczyk, Stawczyk-Eder, Waszak, Eder, Wozniak, Krela-Kazmierczak, Slomski and Dobrowolska.

These results show that altered TNFRSF1B, FCGR3A, and IL1B genes expression can be a predictor of the primary non-response to anti-TNF therapy in CD patients.Copyright © 2021 Lykowska-Szuber, Walczak, Skrzypczak-Zielinska, Suszynska-Zajczyk, Stawczyk-Eder, Waszak, Eder, Wozniak, Krela-Kazmierczak, Slomski and Dobrowolska.

  Title: Enteral nutrition modulation with n-3 PUFAs directs microbiome and lipid metabolism in mice.
  Abstract: Nutritional support using exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) has been studied as primary therapy for the management of liver diseases, Crohn's disease, and cancers. EEN can also increase the number of beneficial microbiotas in the gut, improve bile acid and lipid metabolism, and decrease the number of harmful dietary micro-particles, possibly by influencing disease occurrence and increasing immunity. This study investigated the effects of EEN-n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (3PUFAs) (EEN-3PUFAs) on the gut microbiome, intestinal barrier, and lipid or bile acid metabolism in mice. Metagenomic sequencing technology was used to analyze the effects of EEN-3PUFAs on the composition of gut microbiome signatures. The contents of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bile acids in the feces and liver of the mice were assayed by gas chromatography and ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography/high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. The levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and D-lactic acid in the blood were used to assess intestinal permeability. The results indicated that EEN-3PUFAs could improve the composition of gut microbiome signatures and increase the abundance of Barnesiella and Lactobacillus (genus), Porphyromonadaceae, and Bacteroidia (species), and Bacteroidetes (phylum) after EEN-3PUFAs initiation. In addition, EEN-3PUFAs induced the formation of SCFAs (mainly including acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid) and increased the intestinal wall compared to the control group. In conclusion, EEN-3PUFAs modulate the alterations in gut microbiome signatures, enhanced intestinal barrier, and regulated the fatty acid composition and lipid metabolism shifts and the putative mechanisms underlying these effects.

  Title: Herbal medicine WangShiBaoChiWan improves gastrointestinal health in mice via modulation of intestinal tight junctions and gut microbiota and inhibition of inflammation.
  Abstract: WangShiBoChiWan (WSBCW) is a commonly used Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders. However, its preclinical efficacy and the mechanisms of action have not been adequately studied. The goals of this study were to evaluate the effects of WSBCW on gastrointestinal health and modulation of related biomarkers. Female C57BL mice were randomly assigned into one of the experimental groups consisting of the control, drug controls, and WSBCW at 40, 120, and 360 mg/kg BW. Whole gut transit, small intestinal motility, and intestinal barrier permeability were determined. The castor oil-induced diarrhea mouse model was used to determine the effect of WSBCW on the diarrhea type of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). WSBCW increased whole gut transit and intestinal motility, improved intestinal permeability in healthy animals and alleviated diarrhea symptoms in IBS-D mice. WSBCW upregulated intestinal junction proteins, increased the abundance of Bifidobacterium genus, Desulfovibrio genus and inhibited Bacteroides fragillis group in the gut microbiota, increased intestinal villi lengths, and decreased blood levels of inflammatory cytokines. Our study provided preclinical evidence to verify the effectiveness of WSBCW in gastrointestinal health and elucidate mechanistic insights. The results warrant further investigations to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of WSBCW on gastrointestinal disorders, such as IBS and IBD.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

  Title: Role of serum amitriptyline concentration and CYP2C19 polymorphism in predicting the response to low-dose amitriptyline in irritable bowel syndrome.
  Abstract: Low-dose amitriptyline (AMT) is an effective treatment for diarrhea-dominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Its efficacy depends upon its serum concentration and the patient's CYP2C19 genotype.To identify the association between serum AMT and nortriptyline (NT) concentration and CYP2C19 polymorphism and the clinical response in IBS-D patients.Ninety IBS-D patients were treated of AMT for 6 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated by the results of the Adequate Relief question each week and an IBS severity scoring system (IBS-SSS) at 0, 3, and 6 weeks. CYP2C19 genotyping was performed by direct sequencing. AMT and NT steady-state serum concentrations were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography.The CYP2C19 polymorphism exhibited a significant influence on the NT serum concentration but did not predict the clinical efficacy of AMT for treating IBS-D. The NT steady-state and dose-corrected serum concentrations were significantly correlated with an improvement in the IBS-SSS score after 6 weeks, whereas the AMT serum concentration was not correlated with clinical improvement. The cut-off NT steady-state serum concentration of 2.91 ng/ml may help distinguish responders from non-responders.NT serum concentration but not CYP2C19 polymorphism may be correlated with the clinical efficacy of AMT for treating IBS-D, and such a response may occur at the upper NT threshold of 2.91 ng/ml.Copyright © 2021 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

  Title: Omics data integration identifies ELOVL7 and MMD gene regions as novel loci for adalimumab response in patients with Crohn's disease.
  Abstract: Response to anti-TNF therapy is of pivotal importance in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Here we integrated our and previously reported PBMC derived transcriptomic and genomic data for identification of biomarkers for discrimination between responders and non-responders to anti-TNF therapy. CD patients, who were naïve with respect to the treatment with biologicals, were enrolled in the study. DNA and RNA were extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. RNA-seq was performed using BGISEQ-500. Genotyping was performed using Infinium Global Screening Array. Association regressions were carried out with 12 week response to adalimumab as an outcome variable. RNA-seq analysis confirmed 7 out of 65 previously suggested genes involved in anti-TNF response. Subsequently, analysis of single nucleotide variants in regions of confirmed genes identified 5 variants near MMD and two in ELOVL7 intronic regions associated with treatment response to anti-TNF. Functional analysis has shown that rs1465352, rs4422035 and rs78620886 are listed at H3K9ac_Pro histone modification epigenetic mark. The present study confirmed MMD and ELOVL7 involvement in anti-TNF response and revealed that the regulation of MMD and ELOVL7 gene regions in ADA response may be a part of a complex interplay extending from genetic to epigenetic and to transcriptomic level.

  Title: Intestinal Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Selenized Ulva pertusa Polysaccharides in a Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Inflammatory Bowel Disease Model.
  Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine the alleviative effects of selenized polysaccharides from Ulva pertusa (ulvan-Se) on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in mice. The dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced IBD mouse model was used to explore the protective effects of ulvan-Se on the intestinal mechanical and immune barrier. At doses less than 1208 mg/kg·bw ulvan-Se showed no significant damage to Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice in an acute toxicity test. The results showed that DSS destroyed the mechanical barrier, which includes epithelial cells, while ulvan-Se promoted mRNA expression of tight junction proteins (zonula occludens protein 1, occludin, and claudin-1) and inhibited the infiltration of white blood cells into the intestines. At 100 mg/kg·bw, ulvan-Se enhanced the antioxidant capacity of mice more effectively than the 50 mg/kg·bw ulvan-Se. Furthermore, ulvan-Se improved the intestinal immune barrier by increasing immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin M, while regulating the levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, interferon-γ, and IL-4. Oral administration of ulvan-Se also suppressed tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA expression mediated by the nuclear factor kappa B pathway. Taken together, our findings reveal that ulvan-Se could be used as a potential alternative supplement for reducing intestinal inflammation in IBD.

The results showed that DSS destroyed the mechanical barrier, which includes epithelial cells, while ulvan-Se promoted mRNA expression of tight junction proteins (zonula occludens protein 1, occludin, and claudin-1) and inhibited the infiltration of white blood cells into the intestines. At 100 mg/kg·bw, ulvan-Se enhanced the antioxidant capacity of mice more effectively than the 50 mg/kg·bw ulvan-Se. Furthermore, ulvan-Se improved the intestinal immune barrier by increasing immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin M, while regulating the levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, interferon-γ, and IL-4. Oral administration of ulvan-Se also suppressed tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA expression mediated by the nuclear factor kappa B pathway. Taken together, our findings reveal that ulvan-Se could be used as a potential alternative supplement for reducing intestinal inflammation in IBD.

  Title: Prospective Validation of CD-62L (L-Selectin) as Marker of Durable Response to Infliximab Treatment in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A 5-Year Clinical Follow-up.
  Abstract: The development of biomarkers to guide management of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an unmet need. We developed an in vitro blood assay to predict patient long-term outcome with the anti-TNFα agent infliximab (IFX).Patients with IBD were classified according to the shedding of an L-selectin (CD62L) from the surface of their granulocytes in whole blood. CD62L shedding was quantified by flow cytometry before and after drug administration. A clinical data collection from June 2012 to August 2017 with blinded IFX management was aimed at validating the long-term predictive value of this test.Among 33 patients with IBD (17 Crohn's disease and 5 ulcerative colitis), 22 were predicted functional responders (PFR) and 11 were predicted as nonresponders (NR) according to the in vitro test. Five years after study initiation, 72% of PFR were still treated with IFX (vs 27% in the NR group; P < 0.05), with a median time spent under IFX of 45 vs 12 months (P = 0.019), respectively. Thirty-five medicosurgical events occurred with a median time to first event of 3 vs 30 months (P = 0.023), respectively. Our assay was the best independent predictor of staying long term on IFX (P = 0.056).An assay-based in vitro test for functional blockade of TNFα (CD62L shedding) provides an excellent long-term (at 3-5 years) independent predictor of durable use of IFX in patients with IBD. Testing patients could personalize decision making to significantly reduce costs and risk of adverse events and complications.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

  Title: Risk factors for rebleeding in Crohn's disease patients with acute severe lower gastrointestinal bleeding: With special reference to the role of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy.
  Abstract: Acute severe lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) is uncommon; however, it is a potentially life-threatening complication, and its recurrence is common. We thus aimed to identify the predictors for rebleeding in CD patients with acute severe LGIB and particularly focused on whether anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy lowers the risk of rebleeding compared with conventional medical therapy (CMT) or surgery.The risk of rebleeding was analyzed in 131 CD patients with acute severe LGIB. Patients were classified into the CMT group (n = 99), anti-TNF therapy group (n = 22), and surgery group (n = 10). No patients in the surgery group received anti-TNF therapy.During the median follow-up of 98 months after the first episode of acute severe LGIB, rebleeding occurred in 50.5%, 18.2%, and 30.0% of the CMT group, anti-TNF therapy group, and surgery group, respectively (P = 0.015). The cumulative risks of rebleeding at 1 and 10 years were 20.0% and 64.7% in the CMT group, 13.6% and 18.4% in the anti-TNF therapy group, and 0% and 40.7% in the surgery group, respectively (P = 0.020). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that anti-TNF therapy was associated with a lower risk of rebleeding compared with CMT (hazard ratio, 0.303; 95% confidence interval, 0.108-0.849; P = 0.023).In CD patients with acute severe LGIB, anti-TNF therapy may reduce the risk of rebleeding compared with CMT. Although surgery is considered effective in preventing early rebleeding, concomitant anti-TNF therapy may be helpful in further lowering the long-term risk of rebleeding.© 2021 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

  Title: Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell-secreted exosome alleviates dextran sulfate sodium-induced acute colitis by Treg cell induction and inflammatory cytokine reduction.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is an inflammatory condition that results in gastrointestinal tract damage. Various factors, including environmental and genetic agents, disrupt the function of the intestinal immune system that can lead to IBD. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) display an immunoregulatory function and demonstrate regenerative potential by paracrine action. In this study, we evaluated the immunomodulatory effects of MSCs' derived exosomes in the acute form of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Exosomes were isolated from adipose-derived MSCs. Acute colitis was induced by DSS. The exosome was used by intraperitoneal injection into mice with acute colitis. Stool consistency, body weight changes, bleeding severity, colon length, and weight were examined. At the experimental endpoint (Day 7), the changes in the colon tissue were evaluated. The level of cytokines of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-17 (IL-17), IL-4, IL-12, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and, IL-10, and Treg cells percentage were assayed. Results showed that exosome administration diminished colon shortening, bodyweight loss, bleeding, and colon injury. The levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-12, and IL-17 were decreased, and the level of TGF-β, IL-4, and IL-10 were increased in lymph node and spleen of mice treated with exosome.  Percentages of CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ Treg cells were grown in the lymph node and spleen of mice treated with exosomes. Overall, current data suggest that MSC-derived exosome could regulate the Treg population and improves inflammation in DSS-induced acute colitis.© 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

  Title: Evaluation of ustekinumab trough levels during induction and maintenance therapy with regard to disease activity status in difficult to treat Crohn disease patients.
  Abstract: Ustekinumab (UST) is approved for the treatment of moderate and severe Crohn disease (CD). Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) can help monitor the therapeutic effects of biologics. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of UST-treated CD patients and to determine the UST trough level in clinical and corticosteroid-free remission.This retrospective study included patients with moderate and severe active disease (AD) treated intravenously with a weight-adapted induction dose of UST. The maintenance therapy consisted of 90 mg UST subcutaneously at week 8 and thereafter every 8 or 12 weeks, depending on the clinical response. Clinical and corticosteroid-free remission, Harvey-Bradshaw-Index (HBI), UST trough level, and further laboratory parameters were measured just before the injection of UST at each follow-up evaluation until week 40.37 CD patients with a median HBI of 9 at week 0 were included in the study. Starting from 24% at the beginning of the monitoring period, and 38% of patients at the end of the monitoring period were treated with an 8-week interval (P = .18). There was a significant improvement in clinical (P = .0004), corticosteroid-free remission (P = .03), and HBI (P < .0001) from week 0 until the end of the observation period. The serum UST trough level decreased significantly from 2.0 at week 8 to 0.3, in the maintenance therapy and 0.4 μg/ml at the end of the therapy (P < .0001). Neither UST trough level nor levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) or fecal calprotectin (FC) were associated with disease outcome. Concomitant immunomodulator therapy did not appear to affect the UST trough level or clinical course.UST is an effective treatment option for difficult-to-treat patients with CD. UST trough levels may not be associated with treatment efficacy or the prediction of treatment outcomes in patients with CD. Further prospective randomized trials should be conducted to evaluate whether UST trough levels are associated with treatment outcomes in patients with CD.Copyright © 2021 the Author(s).

  Title: HLA-Restriction of Human Treg Cells Is Not Required for Therapeutic Efficacy of Low-Dose IL-2 in Humanized Mice.
  Abstract: Regulatory T (Treg) cells are essential to maintain immune homeostasis in the intestine and Treg cell dysfunction is associated with several inflammatory and autoimmune disorders including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Efforts using low-dose (LD) interleukin-2 (IL-2) to expand autologous Treg cells show therapeutic efficacy for several inflammatory conditions. Whether LD IL-2 is an effective strategy for treating patients with IBD is unknown. Recently, we demonstrated that LD IL-2 was protective against experimental colitis in immune humanized mice in which human CD4+ T cells were restricted to human leukocyte antigen (HLA). Whether HLA restriction is required for human Treg cells to ameliorate colitis following LD IL-2 therapy has not been demonstrated. Here, we show that treatment with LD IL-2 reduced 2,4,6-trinitrobenzensulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis severity in NOD.PrkdcscidIl2rg-/- (NSG) mice reconstituted with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. These data demonstrate the utility of standard immune humanized NSG mice as a pre-clinical model system to evaluate therapeutics targeting human Treg cells to treat IBD.Copyright © 2021 Tyagi, Jacobse, Li, Allaman, Otipoby, Sampson, Wilson and Goettel.

  Title: Targeting Immune Cell Metabolism in the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Abstract: The cells of the immune system are highly dynamic, constantly sensing and adapting to changes in their surroundings. Complex metabolic pathways govern leukocytes' ability to fine-tune their responses to external threats. Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 and hypoxia inducible factor are important hubs of these pathways and play a critical role coordinating cell activation and proliferation and cytokine production. For this reason, these molecules are attractive therapeutic targets in inflammatory disease. Insight into perturbations in immune cell metabolic pathways and their impact on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) progression are starting to emerge. However, it remains to be determined whether the aberrations in immune metabolism that occur in gut resident immune cells contribute to disease pathogenesis or are reflected in the peripheral blood of patients with IBD. In this review, we explore what is known about the metabolic profile of T cells, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells in IBD and discuss the potential of manipulating immune cell metabolism as a novel approach to treating IBD.© 2021 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

  Title: 6-(methylsulfinyl)hexyl isothiocyanate (6-MITC) from Wasabia japonica alleviates inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by potential inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β).
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) describes a set of disorders involving alterations to gastrointestinal physiology and mucosal immunity. Unravelling its complex pathophysiology is important since many IBD patients are refractory to or suffer adverse side effects from current treatments. Isothiocyanates (ITCs), such as 6-(methylsulfinyl)hexyl ITC (6-MITC) in Wasabia japonica, have potential anti-inflammatory activity. We aimed to elucidate the pathways through which 6-MITC alleviates inflammation by examining its role in the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway through inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β) using a chemically induced murine model of IBD, cell-based and in silico techniques. The effects of 6-MITC and two NF-κB inhibitors, sulfasalazine (SS), pyrrolidine dithiolcarbamate (PDTC) were investigated on a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine mouse model of acute and chronic colitis using macroscopic measurements and pro-inflammatory markers. The effect of 6-MITC on NF-κB induction was assessed using a murine macrophage cell line. Complexes of GSK-3β-6-MITC and GSK-3β-ATP were generated in silico to elucidate the mechanism of 6-MITC's direct inhibition of GSK-3β. Changes in pro-inflammatory markers, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (increased) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (decreased) demonstrated that iNOS regulation occurred at the translational level. Intraperitoneal (ip) injection of 6-MITC to the colitis-induced mice ameliorated weight loss whereas oral administration had negligible effect.

  Title: 6-(methylsulfinyl)hexyl isothiocyanate (6-MITC) from Wasabia japonica alleviates inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by potential inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β).
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) describes a set of disorders involving alterations to gastrointestinal physiology and mucosal immunity. Unravelling its complex pathophysiology is important since many IBD patients are refractory to or suffer adverse side effects from current treatments. Isothiocyanates (ITCs), such as 6-(methylsulfinyl)hexyl ITC (6-MITC) in Wasabia japonica, have potential anti-inflammatory activity. We aimed to elucidate the pathways through which 6-MITC alleviates inflammation by examining its role in the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway through inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β) using a chemically induced murine model of IBD, cell-based and in silico techniques. The effects of 6-MITC and two NF-κB inhibitors, sulfasalazine (SS), pyrrolidine dithiolcarbamate (PDTC) were investigated on a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine mouse model of acute and chronic colitis using macroscopic measurements and pro-inflammatory markers. The effect of 6-MITC on NF-κB induction was assessed using a murine macrophage cell line. Complexes of GSK-3β-6-MITC and GSK-3β-ATP were generated in silico to elucidate the mechanism of 6-MITC's direct inhibition of GSK-3β. Changes in pro-inflammatory markers, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (increased) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (decreased) demonstrated that iNOS regulation occurred at the translational level. Intraperitoneal (ip) injection of 6-MITC to the colitis-induced mice ameliorated weight loss whereas oral administration had negligible effect. Fecal blood and colon weight/length ratio parameters improved on treatment with 6-MITC and the other NF-κB inhibitors. Levels of NF-κB decreased upon addition of 6-MITC in vitro while structural studies showed 6-MITC acts competitively to inhibit GSK-3β at the ATP binding site. In this study we demonstrated that 6-MITC inhibits NF-κB signaling via GSK-3β inhibition ameliorating fecal blood, colonic alterations and DSS-induced weight loss indirectly indicating reduced intestinal stress. Taken together these results suggest a role for 6-MITC in the treatment of IBD acting to alleviate inflammation through the GSK-3β/NF-κB pathway.

  Title: DSS-induced colitis is associated with adipose tissue dysfunction and disrupted hepatic lipid metabolism leading to hepatosteatosis and dyslipidemia in mice.
  Abstract: Considering high prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), this study aimed to elucidate molecular mechanisms for how intestinal inflammatory conditions are causally linked to hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia. Both younger and older mice treated with acute or chronic dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) developed colitis, which was evidenced by weight loss, colon length shortening, and elevated disease activity index and inflammation score. They also showed decreased expression of intestinal barrier function-related proteins and elevated plasma lipopolysaccharide level, indicating DSS-induced barrier dysfunction and thereby increased permeability. Interestingly, they displayed phenotypes of hepatic fat accumulation and abnormal blood lipid profiles. This DSS-induced colitis-associated lipid metabolic dysfunction was due to overall disruption of metabolic processes including fatty acid oxidation, lipogenesis, lipolysis, reverse cholesterol transport, bile acid synthesis, and white adipose tissue browning and brown adipose tissue thermogenesis, most of which are mediated by key regulators of energy homeostasis such as FGF21, adiponectin, and irisin, via SIRT1/PGC-1α- and LXRα-dependent pathways. Our study suggests a potential molecular mechanism underlying the comorbidity of NAFLD and IBD, which could provide a key to understanding how the two diseases are pathogenically linked and discovering critical therapeutic targets for their treatment.

  Title: Oral Sucrosomial Iron Is as Effective as Intravenous Ferric Carboxy-Maltose in Treating Anemia in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis.
  Abstract: Anemia is a frequent complication of ulcerative colitis, and is frequently caused by iron deficiency. Oral iron supplementation displays high rates of gastrointestinal adverse effects. However, the formulation of sucrosomial iron (SI) has shown higher tolerability. We performed a prospective study to compare the effectiveness and tolerability of oral SI and intravenous ferric carboxy-maltose (FCM) in patients with ulcerative colitis in remission and mild-to-moderate anemia. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive 60 mg/day for 8 weeks and then 30 mg/day for 4 weeks of oral SI or intravenous 1000 mg of FCM at baseline. Hemoglobin and serum levels of iron and ferritin were assessed after 4, 8, and 12 weeks from baseline. Hemoglobin and serum iron increased in both groups after 4 weeks of therapy, and remained stable during follow up, without significant treatment or treatment-by-time interactions (p = 0.25 and p = 0.46 for hemoglobin, respectively; p = 0.25 and p = 0.26 for iron, respectively). Serum ferritin did not increase over time during SI supplementation, while it increased in patients treated with FCM (treatment effect, p = 0.0004; treatment-by-time interaction effect, p = 0.0002). Overall, this study showed that SI and FCM displayed similar effectiveness and tolerability for treatment of mild-to-moderate anemia in patients with ulcerative colitis under remission.

  Title: Dual Functional Eudragit® S100/L30D-55 and PLGA Colon-Targeted Nanoparticles of Iridoid Glycoside for Improved Treatment of Induced Ulcerative Colitis.
  Abstract: Iridoid glycosides (IG) as the major active fraction of Syringa oblata Lindl. has a proven anti-inflammatory effect for ulcerative colitis (UC). However, its current commercial formulations are hampered by low bioavailability and unable to reach inflamed colon. To overcome the limitation, dual functional IG-loaded nanoparticles (DFNPs) were prepared to increase the residence time of IG in colon. The protective mechanism of DFNPs on DSS-induced colonic injury was evaluated in rats.We prepared DFNPs using the oil-in-water emulsion method. PLGA was selected as sustained-release polymer, and ES100 and EL30D-55 as pH-responsive polymers. The morphology and size distribution of NPs were measured by SEM and DLS technique. To evaluate colon targeting of DFNPs, DiR, was encapsulated as a fluorescent probe into NPs. Fluorescent distribution of NPs were investigated. The therapeutic potential and in vivo transportation of NPs in gastrointestinal tract were evaluated in a colitis model.SEM images and zeta data indicated the successful preparation of DFNPs. This formulation exhibited high loading capacity. Drug release results suggested DFNPs released less than 20% at the first 6 h in simulated gastric fluid (pH1.2) and simulated small intestine fluid (pH6.8). A high amount of 84.7% sustained release from NPs in simulated colonic fluid (pH7.4) was beyond 24 h. DiR-loaded NPs demonstrated a much higher colon accumulation, suggesting effective targeting due to functionalization with pH and time-dependent polymers. DFNPs could significantly ameliorate the colonic damage by reducing DAI, macroscopic score, histological damage and cell apoptosis. Our results also proved that the potent anti-inflammatory effect of DFNPs is contributed by decrease of NADPH, gene expression of COX-2 and MMP-9 and the production of TNF-α, IL-17, IL-23 and PGE2.We confirm that DFNPs exert protective effects through inhibiting the inflammatory response, which could be developed as a potential colon-targeted system.© 2021 Gao et al.

  Title: Post-treatment persistent alpha-fetoprotein elevation in a patient with testicular cancer.
  Abstract: Persistent alpha-fetoprotein elevation in a patient following orchiectomy and chemotherapy for non-seminomatous testicular germ cell tumor is a rare condition when persistence of the tumor and false positivity of tumor marker elevation has to be differentiated. This situation often leads to over-treatment and potential toxicity with adverse events which can be severe.A case of a patient with the abovementioned disease and course of treatment is presented. As no radiological signs of the disease were present and the level of alpha-fetoprotein was mild and stable, the tumor marker elevation was evaluated as false positive. Possible causes of the tumor marker elevation were identified as other serious diseases are known to cause such a false positivity. The level of alpha-fetoprotein remained unchanged despite alcohol abstinence and hepatoprotective treatment by silymarin. Hepatitis B and C serological tests were negative, and no other malignant tumor was identified. Finding of terminal ileum circular wall thickening and stratification with a reaction of surrounding visceral fat and lymph nodes persisting in CT scans suggests the presence of inflammatory bowel disease, possibly explaining the alpha-fetoprotein elevation. The patient has no evidence of the disease more than 14 months after the end of chemotherapy treatment with no change in the elevation of alpha-fetoprotein.After the treatment, when no other indication of testicular cancer than an elevated alpha-fetoprotein level is present, the patient should be managed by ongoing surveillance.

  Title: Hepatic mosaic enhancement pattern correlates with increased inflammatory activity and adverse therapeutic outcomes in patients with Crohn's disease.
  Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate the role of hepatic mosaic enhancement pattern (HMEP) on computed tomography images in the disease activity and therapeutic outcome of Crohn's Disease (CD).Twenty-five CD patients with HMEP comprised the HMEP group, and 25 CD patients without HMEP, who had a similar onset age, sex, and disease course with those in the HMEP group, comprised the non-HMEP group. No underlying liver/biliary disease was observed in any of the patients. Clinical characteristics, laboratory test results, Lémann index, and CD endoscopic index of severity (CDEIS) were compared between the groups using the Student t-, Mann-Whitney U, Chi square, or Fisher's exact tests. Patients received top-down, step-up, or traditional treatment during the follow-up period. After the 1-year follow-up, therapeutic outcomes (active inflammation [CDEIS > 3.5 if the endoscopic data were available, or C-reactive protein level > 5 mg/L if the endoscopic data were unavailable] or remission) were evaluated.The occurrence rate of fistulas/abscesses was higher in the HMEP group (84%, 21/25) than in the non-HMEP group (48%, 12/25) with no statistical significance (P = 0.056). The HMEP group showed a higher C-reactive protein level (P = 0.001), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P = 0.013), and blood platelet count (P = 0.005). There was no significant difference in therapeutic strategies between the groups (P = 0.509). The HMEP group showed a significantly lower remission ratio after anti-inflammatory treatment than the non-HMEP group (P = 0.045).HMEP was correlated with increased inflammatory activity and adverse therapeutic outcomes in CD. This finding provided insights regarding novel markers of CD diagnosis and treatment.

  Title: Functional Assessment of Intestinal Permeability and Neutrophil Transepithelial Migration in Mice using a Standardized Intestinal Loop Model.
  Abstract: The intestinal mucosa is lined by a single layer of epithelial cells that forms a dynamic barrier allowing paracellular transport of nutrients and water while preventing passage of luminal bacteria and exogenous substances. A breach of this layer results in increased permeability to luminal contents and recruitment of immune cells, both of which are hallmarks of pathologic states in the gut including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Mechanisms regulating epithelial barrier function and transepithelial migration (TEpM) of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) are incompletely understood due to the lack of experimental in vivo methods allowing quantitative analyses. Here, we describe a robust murine experimental model that employs an exteriorized intestinal segment of either ileum or proximal colon. The exteriorized intestinal loop (iLoop) is fully vascularized and offers physiological advantages over ex vivo chamber-based approaches commonly used to study permeability and PMN migration across epithelial cell monolayers. We demonstrate two applications of this model in detail: (1) quantitative measurement of intestinal permeability through detection of fluorescence-labeled dextrans in serum after intraluminal injection, (2) quantitative assessment of migrated PMN across the intestinal epithelium into the gut lumen after intraluminal introduction of chemoattractants. We demonstrate feasibility of this model and provide results utilizing the iLoop in mice lacking the epithelial tight junction-associated protein JAM-A compared to controls. JAM-A has been shown to regulate epithelial barrier function as well as PMN TEpM during inflammatory responses. Our results using the iLoop confirm previous studies and highlight the importance of JAM-A in regulation of intestinal permeability and PMN TEpM in vivo during homeostasis and disease. The iLoop model provides a highly standardized method for reproducible in vivo studies of intestinal homeostasis and inflammation and will significantly enhance understanding of intestinal barrier function and mucosal inflammation in diseases such as IBD.

  Title: Functional Assessment of Intestinal Permeability and Neutrophil Transepithelial Migration in Mice using a Standardized Intestinal Loop Model.
  Abstract: The intestinal mucosa is lined by a single layer of epithelial cells that forms a dynamic barrier allowing paracellular transport of nutrients and water while preventing passage of luminal bacteria and exogenous substances. A breach of this layer results in increased permeability to luminal contents and recruitment of immune cells, both of which are hallmarks of pathologic states in the gut including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Mechanisms regulating epithelial barrier function and transepithelial migration (TEpM) of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) are incompletely understood due to the lack of experimental in vivo methods allowing quantitative analyses. Here, we describe a robust murine experimental model that employs an exteriorized intestinal segment of either ileum or proximal colon. The exteriorized intestinal loop (iLoop) is fully vascularized and offers physiological advantages over ex vivo chamber-based approaches commonly used to study permeability and PMN migration across epithelial cell monolayers. We demonstrate two applications of this model in detail: (1) quantitative measurement of intestinal permeability through detection of fluorescence-labeled dextrans in serum after intraluminal injection, (2) quantitative assessment of migrated PMN across the intestinal epithelium into the gut lumen after intraluminal introduction of chemoattractants. We demonstrate feasibility of this model and provide results utilizing the iLoop in mice lacking the epithelial tight junction-associated protein JAM-A compared to controls. JAM-A has been shown to regulate epithelial barrier function as well as PMN TEpM during inflammatory responses. Our results using the iLoop confirm previous studies and highlight the importance of JAM-A in regulation of intestinal permeability and PMN TEpM in vivo during homeostasis and disease. The iLoop model provides a highly standardized method for reproducible in vivo studies of intestinal homeostasis and inflammation and will significantly enhance understanding of intestinal barrier function and mucosal inflammation in diseases such as IBD.

  Title: COVID-19 illness and autoimmune diseases: recent insights.
  Abstract: The aim of this review is to explore whether patients with autoimmune diseases (AIDs) were at high risk of infection during the COVID-19 epidemic and how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic affected immune system.A systematic literature search was performed using the foreign databases (NCBI, web of science, EBSCO, ELSEVIER ScienceDirect) and Chinese databases (WanFang, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), VIP, CBM) to locate all relevant publications (up to January 10, 2021). The search strategies used Medical Search Headings (MeSH) headings and keywords for "COVID-19" or "SARS-CoV-2" or "coronavirus" and "autoimmune disease".This review evaluates the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the immune system through ACE-2 receptor binding as the main pathway for cell attachment and invasion. It is speculated that SARS-COV-2 infection can activate lymphocytes and inflammatory response, which may play a role in the clinical onset of AIDs and also patients were treated with immunomodulatory drugs during COVID-19 outbreak. Preliminary studies suggested that the risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19 in patients with AIDs treated with immunomodulators or biologics might not increase. A large number of samples are needed for further verification, leading to an excessive immune response to external stimuli.The relationship between autoimmune diseases and SARS-CoV-2 infection is complex. During the COVID-19 epidemic, individualized interventions for AIDs should be provided such as Internet-based service.

  Title: Gegen Qinlian decoction relieved DSS-induced ulcerative colitis in mice by modulating Th17/Treg cell homeostasis via suppressing IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling.
  Abstract: Gegen Qinlian decoction (GQ) is a traditional Chinese herbal prescription that has been widely used for the treatment of bacterial dysentery and enteric typhoid fever. Recently, GQ has been clinically reported to be a potential candidate for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). However, the immunoregulatory function of GQ in the treatment of UC has not been fully elucidated.This study focused on the role of immune imbalance in the pathogenesis of UC and the immunomodulatory effect of GQ in the treatment of UC.The UC model was established by treating female mice with 3.0% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 7 days, and GQ was orally administered at dosages of 1.5 and 7.5 g/kg/day. Inflammatory factors were detected by ELISA and qRT-PCR. Treg and Th17 cell dysregulation was analyzed by qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Proteins related to IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling were detected by western blotting.GQ significantly alleviated the symptoms of UC mice and suppressed the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO). Furthermore, the production of proinflammatory factors, such as IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6, was dramatically reduced after GQ administration. Furthermore, GQ improved the infiltration of Treg and Th17 cells into the colons and decreased the expression of inflammatory factors, such as TGF-β1 and IL-17. The frequencies of Treg and Th17 cells in the Peyer's patches and spleen were reduced by GQ administration; however, GQ had no significant regulatory effect on normal mice. The western blotting results showed that GQ markedly suppressed the phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 and decreased the transcription function of phosphorylated STAT3.Taken together, these results indicated that GQ alleviated DSS-induced UC by suppressing IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling to restore Treg and Th17 cell homeostasis in colonic tissue.Copyright © 2021.

  Title: Cyclosporine modulates neutrophil functions via the SIRT6-HIF-1α-glycolysis axis to alleviate severe ulcerative colitis.
  Abstract: Cyclosporine A (CsA) is routinely used to treat patients with steroid-refractory acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC). Here, we studied the underlying mechanisms of CsA-mediated alleviation in ASUC patients.Neutrophil functions including expression of cytokines, apoptosis, and migration were measured by qRT-PCR, flow cytometry, and Transwell assay. Dynamic changes of glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were measured by a Seahorse extracellular flux analyzer. Gene differences were determined and verified by RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting. Small interfering RNA and inhibitors were used to knock down Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) in HL-60 cells and block expression of SIRT6, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), and pyruvate dehydrogenase lipoamide kinase isozyme 4 (PDK4) in neutrophils.We found that HIF-1α expression and glycolysis significantly increased, while the release of IL-8, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), the apoptosis, and ability of migration markedly decreased in neutrophils of ASUC patients who responded to CsA (Response group) compared with those who did not respond to CsA (Nonresponse group). We also observed that CsA-induced functional alternation of neutrophils was initiated through suppressing SIRT6 expression, which is responsible for expression of the downstream signaling molecules (e.g., HIF-1α, PFKFB3) and PDK4 ubiquitination, leading to fueling neutrophil glycolysis and TCA cycle. Furthermore, blockage of SIRT6 signaling demonstrated to be the same functional changes as CsA to decrease the migration of neutrophils.The data reveal a novel mechanism of CsA in alleviating ASUC by promoting neutrophil HIF-1α expression and restricting excessive neutrophil activation in a SIRT6-HIF-1α-glycolysis axis, suggesting SIRT6 as a candidate target for maintaining mucosal homeostasis and treating intestinal inflammation.© 2021 The Authors.

  Title: A randomized controlled trial on the coloprotective effect of coenzyme Q10 on immune-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative status, antimicrobial peptides, and microRNA-146a expression in patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis.
  Abstract: Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), having potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pharmacological properties, has recently been shown to be a safe and promising agent in maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis (UC). This trial was, therefore, designed to determine CoQ10 efficacy on inflammation and antioxidant status, antimicrobial peptides, and microRNA-146a expression in UC patients.In this randomized double-blind controlled trial, 88 mild-to-moderate UC patients were randomly allocated to receive CoQ10 (200 mg/day) or placebo (rice flour) for 2 months. At the baseline and at an 8-week follow-up, serum levels of Nrf2, cathelicidin LL-37, β-defensin 2, IL-10, IL-17, NF-κB p65 activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), simple clinical colitis activity index questionnaire (SCCAIQ), and quality of life (IBDQ-32 score), as well as an expression rate of microRNA-146a were measured.A significant reduction was detected in the serum IL-17 level, activity of NF-κB p65 in PBMCs, and also SCCAI score in the CoQ10 group compared to the placebo group, whereas IL-10 serum concentrations and IBDQ-32 score of the CoQ10 group considerably increased versus the control group; the changes of these variables were also significantly different within and between groups at the end of the study. Furthermore, CoQ10 remarkably increased serum levels of cathelicidin LL-37. A significant change in serum cathelicidin LL-37 levels was also observed between the two groups. No statistical difference, however, was seen between the two groups in terms of the serum levels of Nrf2 and β-defensin 2 and the relative expression of microRNA-146a.Our results indicate that CoQ10 supplementation, along with drug therapy, appears to be an efficient reducer of inflammation in patients with mild-to-moderate UC at a remission phase.The research has also been registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT): IRCT20090822002365N17.© 2021.

  Title: Dextran sulfate sodium-induced inflammation and colitis in mice are ameliorated by (R)-ketamine, but not (S)-ketamine: A role of TrkB signaling.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that causes long-lasting inflammation and colitis in the gastrointestinal tract. Depression is a common symptom in patients with UC. (R)-ketamine is a new safer antidepressant than (R,S)-ketamine and (S)-ketamine. Here, we examined the effects of two ketamine enantiomers on the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model of UC. Ingestion of 3% DSS in drinking water for 14 days increased the scores of Disease Activity Index (DAI) in mice. Repeated administration of (R)-ketamine (10 mg/kg/day, 14 days or last 7 days), but not (S)-ketamine (10 mg/kg/day, 14 days or last 7 days), significantly ameliorated the increased DAI score and increased blood levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in DSS-treated mice. In addition, (R)-ketamine, but not (S)-ketamine, attenuated the reduced colonic length in DSS-treated mice. Furthermore, DSS-induced increased DAI score and blood IL-6 levels were significantly ameliorated after subsequent repeated administration of (R)-ketamine (10 mg/kg/day for last 7 days), but not 5-aminosalicyclic acid (50 mg/kg/day for last 7 days). Moreover, the pretreatment with a tropomyosin-receptor-kinase B (TrkB) antagonist ANA-12 (0.5 mg/kg) significantly blocked the beneficial effects of (R)-ketamine in DSS-induced UC model. The study shows that (R)-ketamine can produce beneficial effects in DSS-induced colitis model through TrkB stimulation. Therefore, (R)-ketamine may be a novel therapeutic drug for inflammatory bowel diseases such as UC.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

  Title: Dextran sulfate sodium-induced inflammation and colitis in mice are ameliorated by (R)-ketamine, but not (S)-ketamine: A role of TrkB signaling.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that causes long-lasting inflammation and colitis in the gastrointestinal tract. Depression is a common symptom in patients with UC. (R)-ketamine is a new safer antidepressant than (R,S)-ketamine and (S)-ketamine. Here, we examined the effects of two ketamine enantiomers on the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model of UC. Ingestion of 3% DSS in drinking water for 14 days increased the scores of Disease Activity Index (DAI) in mice. Repeated administration of (R)-ketamine (10 mg/kg/day, 14 days or last 7 days), but not (S)-ketamine (10 mg/kg/day, 14 days or last 7 days), significantly ameliorated the increased DAI score and increased blood levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in DSS-treated mice. In addition, (R)-ketamine, but not (S)-ketamine, attenuated the reduced colonic length in DSS-treated mice. Furthermore, DSS-induced increased DAI score and blood IL-6 levels were significantly ameliorated after subsequent repeated administration of (R)-ketamine (10 mg/kg/day for last 7 days), but not 5-aminosalicyclic acid (50 mg/kg/day for last 7 days). Moreover, the pretreatment with a tropomyosin-receptor-kinase B (TrkB) antagonist ANA-12 (0.5 mg/kg) significantly blocked the beneficial effects of (R)-ketamine in DSS-induced UC model. The study shows that (R)-ketamine can produce beneficial effects in DSS-induced colitis model through TrkB stimulation. Therefore, (R)-ketamine may be a novel therapeutic drug for inflammatory bowel diseases such as UC.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

  Title: Update: Innate Lymphoid Cells in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and nonspecific intestinal inflammatory condition with high relapse rate. Its pathogenesis has been linked to dysbacteriosis, genetic and environmental factors. In recent years, a new type of lymphocytes, termed innate lymphoid cells, has been described and classified into three subtypes of innate lymphoid cells-group 1, group 2 and group 3. An imbalance among these subsets' interaction with gut microbiome, and other immune cells affects intestinal mucosal homeostasis. Understanding the role of innate lymphoid cells may provide ideas for developing novel and targeted approaches for treatment of IBD.© 2021.

  Title: Maternal thiopurine metabolism during pregnancy in inflammatory bowel disease and clearance of thiopurine metabolites and outcomes in exposed neonates.
  Abstract: Azathioprine and mercaptopurine are considered safe during pregnancy. However, the pharmacokinetic effects of pregnancy on thiopurine metabolism are undefined.To characterise thiopurine metabolism in pregnancy and measure infant metabolite levels and outcomes.Women with IBD who were taking a thiopurine and pregnant or trying to conceive were recruited. Maternal thiopurine metabolites were measured pre-conception, in each trimester, at delivery and post-partum. Infant metabolite levels, full blood examination and liver function testing were performed at birth, and repeated until levels undetectable and haematological and biochemical abnormalities resolved.Forty patients were included with measurements on at least two occasions, and two with only mother-baby levels at delivery. The median maternal 6-TGN level dropped in the second trimester compared with post-partum (179.0 vs 323.5 pmol/8 × 108 RBCs, P < 0.001) and the median 6-MMP level increased in the second trimester compared with post-partum (1103.0 vs 329.5 pmol/8 × 108 RBCs, P < 0.01). At delivery, the median 6-TGN level was lower in infants (n = 20) than mothers (78.5 vs 217 pmol/8 × 108 RBCs) (P < 0.001). Metabolites were not detected at 6 weeks in any infants. Anaemia was not seen, but thrombocytosis and abnormal liver biochemistry were detected in 80% of infants from 6 weeks, which gradually improved.6-TGN levels decrease and 6-MMP levels increase in the second trimester of pregnancy. Infants are exposed to thiopurine metabolites at low levels with clearance by 6 weeks and no anaemia. The cause of infant thrombocytosis and abnormal liver biochemistry in the absence of metabolites is unclear.© 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

  Title: Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy associated with azathioprine: A case series.
  Abstract: Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is characterised by otherwise unexplained maternal pruritus, increased serum bile acid concentration over 10 μmol/L and spontaneous relief of symptoms and liver abnormalities after delivery. It occurs most frequently during the third trimester and is usually not induced by medication. Besides, azathioprine is recommended as first-line immunosuppressant in patients with steroid-dependent inflammatory bowel disease and is allowed during pregnancy, in order to stabilize maternal disease.We reviewed all cases of ICP between 2010 and 2018 in two French perinatal centers.We encountered eight pregnancies complicated by atypical ICP among patients treated with azathioprine. ICP associated with azathioprine appears to be biologically more severe and to occur earlier than "standard" ICP. Furthermore, clinical and biochemical abnormalities related to ICP disappear when azathioprine is discontinued. Azathioprine safety should be reconsidered and practitioners advised to discuss discontinuing this drug as soon as ICP diagnosis is established.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

  Title: Adalimumab-induced platelet antibodies resulting in severe thrombocytopenia.
  Abstract: Anti-tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα) agents are effective in diseases including Crohn's disease but may cause cytopenias. The mechanisms involved in anti-TNFα agent-induced thrombocytopenia are scarce. We report a 73-year-old male with Crohn's disease for which he currently used adalimumab, an anti-TNFα agent. He had received mesalazine and infliximab before the treatment of adalimumab. No comorbidities were present. Routine laboratory tests revealed a deep thrombocytopenia (thrombocytes 24 × 109 /L), after which adalimumab was discontinued. Bleeding symptoms included cutaneous haematomas and mild epistaxis. Direct monoclonal antibody-specific immobilization of platelet antigens revealed autoantibodies specific to glycoprotein IIb/IIIa and glycoprotein V platelet receptors. There was no bone marrow suppression. Other causes of the thrombocytopenia were ruled out. The platelet count normalized after adalimumab discontinuation. No further interventions were required. Monitoring thrombocyte levels after initiating anti-TNFα agents is recommended, which could lead to prevention of this potentially fatal phenomenon.© 2021 British Pharmacological Society.

  Title: PD-1/PDL1 Blockade Exacerbates Pancreatic Damage and Immune Response in a Mouse Model of Acute Pancreatitis.
  Abstract: Programmed necrosis factor 1 (PD-1) is significantly overexpressed in lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages and has been studied in depth in tumors. As a member of the negative costimulatory family of immune regulatory molecules, expression of PD-1 and its primary regulatory pathway are related to immune cells. Recently, PD-1 was demonstrated to be clinically important in inflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, glomerulonephritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. PD-1, a negative regulator molecule, was recently found to protect tissues from the inflammatory response and inflammatory cell infiltration. Conversely, PD-1 deficiency may contribute to the occurrence of a diverse array of inflammatory diseases. However, whether PD-1 regulates the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis (AP) is unclear. AP is a noninfectious inflammatory disease with primary pathological manifestations that include edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, and acinar cell necrosis. Among these features, costimulatory molecules including PD-1/PDL1 play a critical role in the regulation of immune response and immune activation. Here, we first found that PD-1 is notably upregulated in neutrophils and macrophages in peripheral blood and pancreatic injury tissue in AP mice. PD-1 gene deficiency exacerbated pancreatic injury in an experimental mouse model of AP. We observed more severe pancreatic injury in PD-1-deficient mice than in control mice, including increased pancreatic edema, inflammatory cells, infiltration, and acinar cell necrosis. We also found that PD-1-deficient mice exhibited higher levels of serum enzymology and inflammatory factors in AP. Furthermore, PD-1/PDL1 neutralizing antibodies significantly aggravated pancreatic and lung injury and increased serum inflammatory cytokine levels. These findings were consistent with those in PD-1-deficient mice. In summary, PD-1 may protect against AP in mice and act as a potential target for the prevention of AP in the future.© 2021.

  Title: Interleukin-28A induces epithelial barrier dysfunction in CD patient-derived intestinal organoids.
  Abstract: Intestinal barrier dysfunction is a pathogenic hallmark in Crohn's disease (CD). Identifying key players that regulate intestinal barrier may provide novel leads for therapeutic intervention. Interleukin-28A (IL-28A) is a newly identified IL-10/interferon cytokine family member, with its most implicated function being antiviral and anti-proliferative properties. However, the role and underlying mechanisms of IL-28A in the regulation of epithelial barrier in CD remain so far unexplored. IL-28A levels were measured in the plasma and biopsies of CD patients and healthy subjects. CD patient-derived intestinal organoids were characterized by differentiation gene markers and then exposed to TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β or LPS, or IL-28A with or without GLPG0634 (filgotinib). Epithelial permeability was assessed by FITC-D4 flux. Expression of junctional components was analyzed by qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence staining, or Western blotting. JAK-STAT activity was analyzed by Western blotting. IL-28A levels were significantly increased in the plasma and biopsies from active patients with CD as compared with healthy subjects. IL-28A and its receptor complex IL-28AR/IL-10R2 were detected in CD patient-derived intestinal organoids and showed a selective response to IFN-γ exposure. IL-28A triggered epithelial barrier disruption and accompanied by reduced ZO-1 and E-cadherin expression. This effect was mediated by JAK-STAT1 pathway. Pre-incubation with the JAK1 inhibitor filgotinib ameliorated the barrier dysfunction induced by IL-28A. These results identified IL-28A as a novel regulator of epithelial barrier function and could be a putative target for CD treatment. We provide novel basic evidence that restoring intestinal barrier is a potential mechanism that contributes to the clinical benefits of JAK1 inhibitor in patients with CD.NEW & NOTEWORTHY IL-28A levels were significantly increased in the plasma and biopsies from active patients with CD as compared with healthy subjects. IFN-γ exposure stimulated IL-28A expression in intestinal organoids. Partially mimicking the effect of IFN-γ, IL-28A impaired epithelial barrier function and disrupted junctional components through the activation of JAK-STAT1 signaling, whereas JAK1 inhibitor ameliorated the above-mentioned effects of IL-28A. These findings highlight the newly identified cytokine IL-28A as a novel contributor to CD pathogenesis and could be a putative target for CD treatment. We also provide new evidence for potential applications of JAK inhibition in CD therapy.

  Title: Interleukin-28A induces epithelial barrier dysfunction in CD patient-derived intestinal organoids.
  Abstract: Intestinal barrier dysfunction is a pathogenic hallmark in Crohn's disease (CD). Identifying key players that regulate intestinal barrier may provide novel leads for therapeutic intervention. Interleukin-28A (IL-28A) is a newly identified IL-10/interferon cytokine family member, with its most implicated function being antiviral and anti-proliferative properties. However, the role and underlying mechanisms of IL-28A in the regulation of epithelial barrier in CD remain so far unexplored. IL-28A levels were measured in the plasma and biopsies of CD patients and healthy subjects. CD patient-derived intestinal organoids were characterized by differentiation gene markers and then exposed to TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β or LPS, or IL-28A with or without GLPG0634 (filgotinib). Epithelial permeability was assessed by FITC-D4 flux. Expression of junctional components was analyzed by qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence staining, or Western blotting. JAK-STAT activity was analyzed by Western blotting. IL-28A levels were significantly increased in the plasma and biopsies from active patients with CD as compared with healthy subjects. IL-28A and its receptor complex IL-28AR/IL-10R2 were detected in CD patient-derived intestinal organoids and showed a selective response to IFN-γ exposure. IL-28A triggered epithelial barrier disruption and accompanied by reduced ZO-1 and E-cadherin expression. This effect was mediated by JAK-STAT1 pathway. Pre-incubation with the JAK1 inhibitor filgotinib ameliorated the barrier dysfunction induced by IL-28A. These results identified IL-28A as a novel regulator of epithelial barrier function and could be a putative target for CD treatment. We provide novel basic evidence that restoring intestinal barrier is a potential mechanism that contributes to the clinical benefits of JAK1 inhibitor in patients with CD.NEW & NOTEWORTHY IL-28A levels were significantly increased in the plasma and biopsies from active patients with CD as compared with healthy subjects. IFN-γ exposure stimulated IL-28A expression in intestinal organoids. Partially mimicking the effect of IFN-γ, IL-28A impaired epithelial barrier function and disrupted junctional components through the activation of JAK-STAT1 signaling, whereas JAK1 inhibitor ameliorated the above-mentioned effects of IL-28A. These findings highlight the newly identified cytokine IL-28A as a novel contributor to CD pathogenesis and could be a putative target for CD treatment. We also provide new evidence for potential applications of JAK inhibition in CD therapy.

  Title: Introducing GATA3 as a prominent player in Crohn's disease.
  Abstract: This study was aimed at gene assessment of Crohn's disease (CD) through protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis to find crucial genes.CD is a major subtype of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which affects gastrointestinal tract. PPI network analysis is a suitable tool to clarify a critical gene as a drug target or diagnostic biomarker for these types of diseases.Gene expression profile GSE126124 of 20 CD patients and 20 healthy controls was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. RNA profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and colon biopsy samples of the studied groups was investigated. Crucial genes were selected and analyzed via the PPI network by Cytoscape software. Gene ontology enrichment for the hubs, bottlenecks, and hub-bottlenecks was performed via CluGO plugin of Cytoscape software.Eighty-one differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among 250 initial DEGs were highlighted as significant by FC>2 and p-value ≤ 0.05, and 69 significant DEGs were used for PPI network construction. The network was characterized by poor connections, so 20 top neighbors were added to form a scale-free network. The main connected component included 39 query DEGs and 20 added first neighbors. Three clusters of biological processes associated with crucial genes were identified and discussed.The results of this study indicated that GATA3 has a key role in CD pathogenesis and could be a possible drug target or diagnostic biomarker for Crohn's disease.©2020 RIGLD, Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases.

  Title: [A case of Listeria meningitis with active ulcerative colitis and a review of literature in the Japanese cases].
  Abstract: A 53-year-old man who had been diagnosed with moderate ulcerative colitis and treated with mesalazine and glucocorticoid steroid was admitted due to fever of unknown origin and diarrhea. Intravenous feeding and treatment with cephem antibiotics were started, but the febrile reaction did not improve at all. Physical examination and various tests showed no specific symptoms, including headache or meningeal irritation. However, the blood culture test showed a positive result of Gram-positive bacilli. Thus, a lumbar puncture was performed and the patient was finally diagnosed with Listeria monocytogenes bacteremia and meningitis. Administration of intravenous meropenem and ampicillin led to the improvement of symptoms without any neurological sequelae. In addition, several cases with opportunistic infection of L. monocytogenes have been reported in recent years in cases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) during immunosuppressive therapy. Consequently, L. monocytogenes infection should be considered as one of differential diagnosis when patients present with IBD patient and are treated by biological or immunosuppressive agents with a fever of unknown origin.

  Title: BBG enhances OLT1177-induced NLRP3 inflammasome inactivation by targeting P2X7R/NLRP3 and MyD88/NF-κB signaling in DSS-induced colitis in rats.
  Abstract: Chronic ulceration of the colon is associated with the activation of TLR4/NF-κB and P2X7R/NLRP3 signaling pathways. We investigated the effect of individual or combined administration of BBG, a P2X7R blocker, and OLT1177, a selective NLRP3 inhibitor, in the dextran sodium sulfate-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) rat model. The ulcerative rats were treated orally with brilliant blue G (BBG) (50 mg/kg/day) or OLT1177 (200 mg/kg/day) or a combination of both. Myd88 and NF-κB levels were measured by ELISA, qRT-PCR, and immunohistochemical staining. Cytokines known to be associated with TLR4/NF-κB or P2X7R/NLRP3 signaling were measured by ELISA. P2X7R and NLRP3 expression were measured by ELISA and qRT-PCR. The administration of BBG or OLT1177 ameliorated the toxic effects of DSS on the colon as they restored normal colonic macroscopic and microscopic morphology. BBG administration, but not OLT1177, reduced the expression of Myd88, NF-κB, IL-6, and TNF-α in addition to lowering P2X7R and oxidative stress levels. Individual BBG or OLT1177 administration decreased NLRP3 inflammasome recruitment and subsequent activation of caspase-1, IL-1β, and IL-18. However, the combined administration of OLT1177 with BBG potentiated its inhibitory effect on the NLRP3, which was reflected by the additional suppressive effect on caspase-1, IL-1β, IL-18 levels. In conclusion, BBG/OLT1177 exhibited complementary effects and effectively ameliorated UC. This novel approach provides a basis for the clinical application of this combination for the treatment of IBDs and might also be promising for the pharmacological intervention of other NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent inflammatory conditions.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

  Title: Schisandrin B-mediated TH17 cell differentiation attenuates bowel inflammation.
  Abstract: Schisandrin B (Sch B) is the major active constituent of the traditional Chinese medicine Schisandra chinensis and has anti-inflammatory activity, but the target of Sch B remains unclear. T helper 17 (TH17) cells have been involved in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Here, we showed that Sch B could decrease IL-17A production of CD4+ T cells by targeting STAT3 in vitro. Importantly, Sch B has therapeutic effects on DSS-induced acute and chronic colitis, CD4+CD45RBhigh T cell-induced colitis. Furthermore, we identified TH17 cells as the direct target of Sch B for mediating its anti-inflammatory activity. Sch B could serve as a lead for developing new therapeutics against TH17 cells or IL-17A cytokine-driven diseases.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

  Title: Evaluation of the therapeutic effects of mycophenolate mofetil targeting Nrf-2 and NLRP3 inflammasome in acetic acid induced ulcerative colitis in rats.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that increases the risk of colorectal cancer. UC is highly associated with the disturbance of the immune system leading to oxidative stress and chronic inflammation of intestine. Therefore, the current study was conducted to investigate the potential anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of MMF against acetic acid-induced UC that might be associated with the regulation of Nrf-2 and NLRP3 inflammasome signaling. UC was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by intracolonic instillation of acetic acid. Forty-eight hours post UC induction, MMF (50 mg/kg/day, orally) was given for 8 consecutive days. Then, colon tissues and blood samples were collected. Results showed that MMF significantly attenuated the acetic acid-induced functional, biochemical, and inflammatory injuries in colon. MMF significantly decreased oxidative stress as indicated by the decreased malondialdehyde concentration and the increased total antioxidant capacity, glutathione, catalase, and superoxide dismutase concentrations in colon tissues. MMF also significantly increased Nrf-2 and decreased NLRP3 inflammasome expressions. Moreover, MMF decreased expression of interferon-gamma and increased expression of interferon-alpha. MMF also significantly decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18. These results suggest that MMF has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects against acetic acid-induced UC through the upregulation of Nrf-2, and INF-α expression in addition to the suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent release of IL1β, IL-18 and INF-γ.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

  Title: Adverse Events of Thiopurine Therapy in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Correlations with Metabolites: A Cohort Study.
  Abstract: In the recent era of growing availability of biological agents, the role of thiopurines needs to be reassessed with the focus on toxicity.We assessed the incidence and predictive factors of thiopurine-induced adverse events (AE) resulting in therapy cessation in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), related to thiopurine metabolites and biochemical abnormalities, and determined overall drug survival.We performed a retrospective, single-center study of children diagnosed with IBD between 2000 and 2019 and treated with thiopurine therapy. The incidence of AE and overall drug survival of thiopurines were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Correlations between thiopurine metabolites and biochemical tests were computed using Spearman's correlation coefficient.Of 391 patients with IBD, 233 patients (162 Crohn's disease, 62 ulcerative colitis, and 9 IBD-unclassified) were prescribed thiopurines (230 azathioprine and 3 mercaptopurine), of whom 50 patients (22%) discontinued treatment, at least temporary, due to thiopurine-induced AE (median follow-up 20.7 months). Twenty-six patients (52%) were rechallenged and 18 of them (70%) tolerated this. Sixteen patients (6%) switched to a second thiopurine agent after azathioprine intolerance and 10 of them (63%) tolerated this. No predictive factors for development of AE could be identified. Concentrations of 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN) were significantly correlated with white blood cell and neutrophil count, 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMP) concentrations with alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase.Approximately 20% of pediatric patients with IBD discontinued thiopurine treatment due to AE. A rechallenge or switch to mercaptopurine is an effective strategy after development of AE. Concentrations of 6-TGN and 6-MMP are associated with biochemical abnormalities.© 2021. The Author(s).

A rechallenge or switch to mercaptopurine is an effective strategy after development of AE. Concentrations of 6-TGN and 6-MMP are associated with biochemical abnormalities.© 2021. The Author(s).

  Title: Humoral response to COVID-19 infection in immunosuppressed patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
  Abstract: The course of coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) might be determined by certain comorbidities (e.g. diabetes, hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases) and advanced age. Because the impact of immunosuppression on disease severity is not entirely clear, management of patients under immunosuppressive treatment remains controversial. Six cases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with COVID-19 on immunosuppressive medication are presented. The aim of this study was to describe patients' clinical manifestation and chronologic development of virus-specific antibodies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection before and after restart with immunosuppressive/biological therapy as an indicator for a specific immune response. All patients were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-RNA with PCR, were in clinical remission prior to COVID-19 and only one patient continued his immunosuppressive treatment during the COVID-19 infection. Initial symptoms of COVID-19 were pyrexia, diarrhea, cephalea, and dysgeusia and anosmia. No patient needed admission to hospital or ICU. The SARS-CoV-2 antibody development was described to be late in three of the six patients. Late antibody development seems to be more frequent in older patients and in patients with combined immunosuppressive treatment. In this scenario, SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing could be useful prior to restarting immunosuppressive therapy.Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

  Title: Regulation of inflammation by the antioxidant haem oxygenase 1.
  Abstract: Haem oxygenase 1 (HO-1), an inducible enzyme responsible for the breakdown of haem, is primarily considered an antioxidant, and has long been overlooked by immunologists. However, research over the past two decades in particular has demonstrated that HO-1 also exhibits numerous anti-inflammatory properties. These emerging immunomodulatory functions have made HO-1 an appealing target for treatment of diseases characterized by high levels of chronic inflammation. In this Review, we present an introduction to HO-1 for immunologists, including an overview of its roles in iron metabolism and antioxidant defence, and the factors which regulate its expression. We discuss the impact of HO-1 induction in specific immune cell populations and provide new insights into the immunomodulation that accompanies haem catabolism, including its relationship to immunometabolism. Furthermore, we highlight the therapeutic potential of HO-1 induction to treat chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and the issues faced when trying to translate such therapies to the clinic. Finally, we examine a number of alternative, safer strategies that are under investigation to harness the therapeutic potential of HO-1, including the use of phytochemicals, novel HO-1 inducers and carbon monoxide-based therapies.

  Title: Increased Interleukin-10 Expression by the Inhibition of Ca2+-Activated K+ Channel KCa3.1 in CD4+CD25+ Regulatory T Cells in the Recovery Phase in an Inflammatory Bowel Disease Mouse Model.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract arising from abnormal responses of the innate and adaptative immune systems. Interleukin (IL)-10-producing CD4+CD25+ regulatory T (Treg) cells play a protective role in the recovery phase of IBD. In the present study, the effects of the administration of the selective Ca2+-activated K+ channel KCa3.1 inhibitor TRAM-34 on disease activities were examined in chemically induced IBD model mice. IBD disease severity, as assessed by diarrhea, visible fecal blood, inflammation, and crypt damage in the colon, was significantly lower in mice administered 1 mg/kg TRAM-34 than in vehicle-administered mice. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction examinations showed that IL-10 expression levels in the recovery phase were markedly increased by the inhibition of KCa3.1 in mesenteric lymph node (mLN) Treg cells of IBD model mice compared with vehicle-administered mice. Among several positive and negative transcriptional regulators (TRs) for IL-10, three positive TRs-E4BP4, KLF4, and Blimp1-were upregulated by the inhibition of KCa3.1 in the mLN Treg cells of IBD model mice. In mouse peripheral CD4+CD25+ Treg cells induced by lectin stimulation, IL-10 expression and secretion were enhanced by the treatment with TRAM-34, together with the upregulation of E4BP4, KLF4, and Blimp1. Collectively, the present results demonstrated that the pharmacological inhibition of KCa3.1 decreased IBD symptoms in the IBD model by increasing IL-10 production in peripheral Treg cells and that IL-10high Treg cells produced by the treatment with KCa3.1 inhibitor may contribute to efficient Treg therapy for chronic inflammatory disorders, including IBD. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Pharmacological inhibition of Ca2+-activated K+ channel KCa3.1 increased IL-10 expression in peripheral Treg cells, together with the upregulation of the transcriptional regulators of IL-10: Krüppel-like factor 4, E4 promoter-binding protein 4, and/or B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1. The manipulation of IL-10high-producing Treg cells by the pharmacological inhibition of KCa3.1 may be beneficial in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.

  Title: Metformin alleviates inflammation in oxazolone induced ulcerative colitis in rats: plausible role of sphingosine kinase 1/sphingosine 1 phosphate signaling pathway.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that is associated with high sphingosine kinase 1(SPHK1) expression in the colon, however its role in pathogenesis of UC is not clearly understood so, the aim of the present study was to clarify the role of SPHK1 and investigate whether the anti-inflammatory effects of metformin in UC is mediated by Sphingosine kinase 1/sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) signaling pathway.Colitis was induced in adult male wistar rats by intra rectal administration of oxazolone in the fifth and seventh days from initial presensitization. Oxazolone treated rats were divided into untreated oxazolone group, metformin and mesalazine treated groups both in a dose of 100 mg/kg/day orally for 21 days. Along with these groups normal control and saline groups were used .Colitis was assessed by colon length, disease activity index (DAI) and histological examination of colontissue. Plasma samples were used to measure S1P.SPHK1 activity, signal transducer and activator of transcription -3(STAT-3), interleukin-6 (IL-6), nitric oxide (NO), myeloperoxidase activity (MPO), reduced glutathione (GSH) and tissue expression of intracellular cell adhesion molecule -1(ICAM-1) and caspase-3 genes were measured in tissue.Metformin successfully attenuated oxazolone colitis by increasing colon length, decreasing DAI and improved colon histologic picture. Metformin also induced a significant decrease in Plasma SIP, SPHK1 activity, inflammatory, oxidative stress markers, ICAM-1 and Caspase-3 genes expression compared to oxazolone group.It is revealed that metformin alleviated inflammation and underlying mechanism may result from inhibition of SPHK1/S1P signaling pathway.

  Title: Genetic Background of Mesalamine-induced Fever and Diarrhea in Japanese Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Abstract: Some patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who were under mesalamine treatment develop adverse reactions called "mesalamine allergy," which includes high fever and worsening diarrhea. Currently, there is no method to predict mesalamine allergy. Pharmacogenomic approaches may help identify these patients. Here we analyzed the genetic background of mesalamine intolerance in the first genome-wide association study of Japanese patients with IBD.Two independent pharmacogenetic IBD cohorts were analyzed: the MENDEL (n = 1523; as a discovery set) and the Tohoku (n = 788; as a replication set) cohorts. Genome-wide association studies were performed in each population, followed by a meta-analysis. In addition, we constructed a polygenic risk score model and combined genetic and clinical factors to model mesalamine intolerance.In the combined cohort, mesalamine-induced fever and/or diarrhea was significantly more frequent in ulcerative colitis vs Crohn's disease. The genome-wide association studies and meta-analysis identified one significant association between rs144384547 (upstream of RGS17) and mesalamine-induced fever and diarrhea (P = 7.21e-09; odds ratio = 11.2). The estimated heritability of mesalamine allergy was 25.4%, suggesting a significant correlation with the genetic background. Furthermore, a polygenic risk score model was built to predict mesalamine allergy (P = 2.95e-2). The combined genetic/clinical prediction model yielded a higher area under the curve than did the polygenic risk score or clinical model alone (area under the curve, 0.89; sensitivity, 71.4%; specificity, 90.8%).Mesalamine allergy was more common in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease. We identified a novel genetic association with and developed a combined clinical/genetic model for this adverse event.© 2021 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press.

  Title: Usefulness of peripheral blood monocyte count to predict relapse in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a prospective longitudinal cohort study.
  Abstract: monocytes play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease but data are scarce regarding activity biomarkers, above all in patients under biologic therapies.the aim of this study was to evaluate the value of monocyte measurements in predicting flares in inflammatory bowel disease patients under maintenance treatment with anti-TNF.a prospective, observational cohort study was designed. Relapse was defined as a Harvey-Bradshaw score > 4 in Crohn's disease, and a partial Mayo score ≥ 2 in ulcerative colitis. Monocyte concentration was quantified at 4-month intervals for twelve months. A total of 95 consecutive patients were included. Median age was 42 years, 50.5 % were female, and 75 % had Crohn's disease.sixteen months after inclusion, 65 (68.4 %) patients remained in clinical remission. Mean monocyte count preceding a relapse was 563 (standard deviation: 144) compared to 405 (standard deviation: 177) in patients who remained in remission. Final monocyte count was significantly different between relapse and remission in Crohn's disease (0.82; 95 % CI: 0.71-0.90; p < 0.005). According to the multivariate analysis, only monocytes and fecal calprotectin were related to more relapses.in conclusion, in inflammatory bowel disease patients under anti-TNF therapy, repeat monocyte counts could help monitor patients, at least in Crohn's disease.

  Title: Usefulness of peripheral blood monocyte count to predict relapse in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a prospective longitudinal cohort study.
  Abstract: monocytes play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease but data are scarce regarding activity biomarkers, above all in patients under biologic therapies.the aim of this study was to evaluate the value of monocyte measurements in predicting flares in inflammatory bowel disease patients under maintenance treatment with anti-TNF.a prospective, observational cohort study was designed. Relapse was defined as a Harvey-Bradshaw score > 4 in Crohn's disease, and a partial Mayo score ≥ 2 in ulcerative colitis. Monocyte concentration was quantified at 4-month intervals for twelve months. A total of 95 consecutive patients were included. Median age was 42 years, 50.5 % were female, and 75 % had Crohn's disease.sixteen months after inclusion, 65 (68.4 %) patients remained in clinical remission. Mean monocyte count preceding a relapse was 563 (standard deviation: 144) compared to 405 (standard deviation: 177) in patients who remained in remission. Final monocyte count was significantly different between relapse and remission in Crohn's disease (0.82; 95 % CI: 0.71-0.90; p < 0.005). According to the multivariate analysis, only monocytes and fecal calprotectin were related to more relapses.in conclusion, in inflammatory bowel disease patients under anti-TNF therapy, repeat monocyte counts could help monitor patients, at least in Crohn's disease.

  Title: Network pharmacology and pharmacokinetics integrated strategy to investigate the pharmacological mechanism of Xianglian pill on ulcerative colitis.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease with high morbidity, which leads to poor quality of life. The Xianglian pill (XLP) is a classical Chinese patent medicine and has been clinically proven to be an effective treatment for UC.The pharmacological mechanism of the key bioactive ingredients of XLP for the treatment of UC was investigated by a network pharmacology and pharmacokinetics integrated strategy.Network pharmacology was used to analyze the treatment effect of nine quantified XLP ingredients on UC. Key pathways were enriched and analyzed by protein-protein interaction and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses. The effect of XLP on Th17 cell differentiation was validated using a mouse model of UC. The binding of nine compounds with JAk2, STAT3, HIF-1α, and HSP90AB1 was assessed using molecular docking. A simple and reliable ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed for the simultaneous quantification of nine ingredients from XLP in plasma and applied to a pharmacokinetic study following oral administration.Nine compounds of XLP, including coptisine, berberine, magnoflorine,berberrubine, jatrorrhizine, palmatine, evodiamine, rutaecarpine, and dehydrocostus lactone, were detected. Network pharmacology revealed 50 crossover genes between the nine compoundsand UC. XLP treats UC mainly by regulating key pathways of the immune system, including Th17 cell differentiation, Jak-Stat, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. An in vivo validation in mice found that XLP inhibits Th17 cell differentiation by suppressing the Jak2-Stat3 pathway, which alleviates mucosal inflammation in UC. Molecular docking confirmed that eight compounds are capable of binding with JAk2, HIF-1α, and HSP90AB1, further confirming the inhibitory effect of XLP on the Jak2-Stat3 pathway. Moreover, apharmacokinetic study revealed that the nine ingredients of XLP are exposed in the plasma and colon tissue, which demonstrates its pharmacological effect on UC.This study evaluates the clinical treatment efficacy of XLP for UC. The network pharmacology and pharmacokinetics integrated strategy evaluation paradigm is efficient in discovering the key pharmacological mechanism of herbal formulae.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier GmbH.

  Title: Function of intestinal barrier protected by regulating the miR-199a-3p in ulcerative colitis: Modulation of IL-23/IL-17A axis.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disorder, which is having higher mortality rate. The present report evaluates the protective effect of miR-199a-3p oligomer for the treatment of Ulcerative colitis (UC). Ulcerative colitis was induced by administration of dextran sulfate sodium [DSS (3%)] with drinking water for the duration of one week in mice and miR-199a-3p oligomer was treated for the same duration. Effect of miR-199a-3p oligomer was determined by estimating the body weight, blood stool and length of colon in UC mice. Inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress parameters and Treg/Th17 ratio was determined in the serum, intestinal and spleen tissue of UC mice. mRNA expression of TGFβ, Foxp3, RORγt and STAT3 was estimated in the intestinal tissue of UC mice. Moreover, permeability of intestine was determined by estimating the expression of FITC-dextran in the serum and expression of junction protein in the tissue of UC mice. The data of the study suggest that treatment with miR-199a-3p oligomer ameliorates the altered condition in ulcerative colitis mice. There was reduction in the level of cytokines and parameters of oxidative stress in the intestine of miR-199a-3p oligomer than UC group. Moreover, intestinal permeability was enhanced in miR-199a-3p oligomer treated UC mice. The level of Th17 in the serum and mRNA expression of TGFβ, Foxp3, RORγt and STAT3 was attenuated in miR-199a-3p oligomer treated UC mice. In conclusion, the data of the study suggest that treatment with miR-199a-3p oligomer ameliorates intestinal barrier in ulcerative colitis by down regulating the IL-17A/IL-23 axis.© 2021 Société Française de Pharmacologie et de Thérapeutique.

  Title: Targeting ectonucleotidases to treat inflammation and halt cancer development in the gut.
  Abstract: CD39 and CD73 control cell immunity by hydrolyzing proinflammatory ATP and ADP (CD39) into AMP, subsequently converted into anti-inflammatory adenosine (CD73). By regulating the balance between effector and regulatory cells, these ectonucleotidases promote immune homeostasis in acute and chronic inflammation; while also appearing to limit antitumor effector immunity in gut cancer. This manuscript focuses on the pivotal role of CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidase function in shaping immune responses in the gut. We focus on those mechanisms deployed by these critical and pivotal ectoenzymes and the regulation in the setting of gastrointestinal tract infections, inflammatory bowel disease and tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. We will highlight translational and clinical implications of the latest and most innovative basic research discoveries of these important players of the purinergic signaling. Immunotherapeutic strategies that have been developed to either boost or control ectonucleotidase expression and activity in important disease settings are also reviewed and the in vivo effects discussed.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

  Title: The demethylase inhibitor GSK-J4 limits inflammatory colitis by promoting de novo synthesis of retinoic acid in dendritic cells.
  Abstract: Dendritic cells (DCs) promote T-cell mediated tolerance to self-antigens and induce inflammation to innocuous-antigens. This dual potential makes DCs fundamental players in inflammatory disorders. Evidence from inflammatory colitis mouse models and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) patients indicated that gut inflammation in IBD is driven mainly by T-helper-1 (Th1) and Th17 cells, suggesting an essential role for DCs in the development of IBD. Here we show that GSK-J4, a selective inhibitor of the histone demethylase JMJD3/UTX, attenuated inflammatory colitis by reducing the inflammatory potential and increasing the tolerogenic features of DCs. Mechanistic analyses revealed that GSK-J4 increased activating epigenetic signals while reducing repressive marks in the promoter of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase isoforms 1 and 3 in DCs, enhancing the production of retinoic acid. This, in turn, has an impact on regulatory T cells (Treg) increasing their lineage stability and gut tropism as well as potentiating their suppressive activity. Our results open new avenues for the treatment of IBD patients.

  Title: Protective effect of 6-paradol in acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis in rats.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis is a gut inflammatory disorder due to altered immune response to gut microbiome, with interplay of environmental and genetic factors. TNF-α activates inflammatory response through a cascade of immune responses, augmenting pro-inflammatory mediators and proteases, activating chemotaxis, and infiltration of inflammatory cells, leading to ulceration and haemorrhage through cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. 6-Paradol, a dietary component in several plants belonging to the Zingiberaceae family, has shown anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Current study evaluates the effect of 6-paradol in amelioration of ulcerative colitis in rats for the first time.6-Paradol (95% purity) was obtained from seeds of Aframomum melegueta. Rats were divided randomly into six groups (n = 8). Group one was administered normal saline; group two was treated with the vehicle only; group three, sulfasalazine 500 mg/kg; and groups four, five, and six, were given 6-paradol (50, 100, 200, respectively) mg/kg orally through gastric gavage for 7 days. Colitis was induced on 4th day by intrarectal administration of 2 ml acetic acid (3%), approximately 3 cm from anal verge. On 8th day, rats were sacrificed, and distal one-third of the colon extending proximally up to 4 cm from anal orifice was taken for biochemical and gross examination. Two centimetres of injured mucosal portion was taken for histopathological investigations. SPSS (ver.26) was used for statistical analysis.Colonic and serum glutathione (GSH) levels decreased, while colonic and serum malondialdehyde (MDA), colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels, and colon weight to length ratio were increased significantly in the colitis untreated group compared to normal control. Treatment with 6-paradol considerably improved all these parameters, especially at a dose of 200 mg/kg (p < 0.001), revealing non-significant differences with sulfasalazine 500 mg/kg and normal control (p = 0.998). Sulfasalazine and 6-paradol in a dose dependent manner also markedly reversed mucosal oedema, atrophy and inflammation, cryptic damage, haemorrhage, and ulceration. There were non-significant differences between low and medium doses and between medium and high doses of 6-paradol for IL-6 and serum MDA levels.6-Paradol demonstrated protection against acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis, probably by anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions.

  Title: CircRNA_103765 acts as a proinflammatory factor via sponging miR-30 family in Crohn's disease.
  Abstract: Increasing evidence suggests that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play critical roles in various pathophysiological activities. However, the role of circRNAs in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains unclear. Here we report the potential roles of hsa_circRNA_103765 in regulating cell apoptosis induced by TNF-α in Crohn's disease (CD). We identify that CircRNA_103765 expression was significantly upregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with active IBD. A positive correlation with TNF-α significantly enhanced circRNA_103765 expression in CD, which was significantly reversed by anti-TNF-α mAb (infliximab) treatment. In vitro experiments showed that TNF-α could induce the expression of circRNA_103765, which was cell apoptosis dependent, while silencing of circRNA_103765 could protect human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) from TNF-α-induced apoptosis. In addition, circRNA_103765 acted as a molecular sponge to adsorb the miR-30 family and impair the negative regulation of Delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4). Collectively, CircRNA_103765 is a novel important regulator of the pathogenesis of IBD via sponging miR-30 family-mediated DLL4 expression changes. Blockade of circRNA_103765 could serve as a novel approach for the treatment of IBD patients.

  Title: CircRNA_103765 acts as a proinflammatory factor via sponging miR-30 family in Crohn's disease.
  Abstract: Increasing evidence suggests that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play critical roles in various pathophysiological activities.

  Title: Luteolin alleviates inflammation and modulates gut microbiota in ulcerative colitis rats.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease related to intestinal dysbiosis. Luteolin has been reported to reduce inflammation. However, it remains unclear whether luteolin ameliorates UC and regulates gut microbiota. In this study, we investigated the effects of luteolin on colonic structure and inflammation of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced rats using hematoxylin-eosin staining, immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and evaluated the effects of luteolin on gut microbiota using 16S rDNA sequencing. We found that luteolin treatment significantly reduced colonic damage, and inhibited colonic inflammation in UC rats, evidenced by the decreased levels of NF-κB, IL-17 and IL-23 in UC rats and the increased level of PPAR-γ. In addition, the 16S rDNA sequencing analysis revealed that luteolin treatment could alter diversity and composition of gut microbiota in UC rats. Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, Roseburia and Butyricicoccus were dominant genera in the luteolin group. Luteolin treatment reduced DSS-induced increased ratios of Lactobacillus and Prevotella_9. Furthermore, KEGG analysis revealed that gut microbiota was mainly related to DNA repair and recombination proteins, ribosome, purine metabolism, peptidases, and pyrimidine metabolism. In conclusion, our results revealed that luteolin could alleviate DSS-induced colitis in rats, and gut microbiota had the potential to serve as promising biomarkers for uncovering the mechanism by which luteolin improved UC.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

  Title: Microbial and metabolic features associated with outcome of infliximab therapy in pediatric Crohn's disease.
  Abstract: Gut microbial dysbiosis and altered metabonomics have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of our study was to characterize the gut microbiome structure and metabolic activities in pediatric CD patients with different clinical outcomes after infliximab (IFX) therapy. Fecal samples were collected from 20 healthy children and 29 newly diagnosed pediatric CD patients. 16S rRNA/ITS2 gene sequencing and targeted metabolomics analysis were applied to profile the gut bacterial microbiome, mycobiome, and metabolome, respectively. Pediatric CD patients exhibited lower relative abundances of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria including Faecalibacterium, Clostridium clusters IV and XIVb, Roseburia, and Ruminococcus, which were correlated with reduced fecal levels of SCFAs. Decreased unconjugated bile acids (BAs) pool size and a lower unconjugated/conjugated BAs ratio were associated with reduced relative abundances of Bifidobacterium and Clostridium clusters IV and XIVb which contain bile salt hydrolases (BSH) genes. IFX treatment enriched the BSH-producing bacteria in CD subjects, which may explain a decreased level of conjugated BAs and an increase in unconjugated BAs as well as the unconjugated/conjugated BAs ratio. Furthermore, a sustained response (SR) of IFX therapy was associated with higher abundances of Methylobacterium, Sphingomonas, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus, and higher fecal concentrations of amino acids, including L-aspartic acid, linoleic acid, and L-lactic acid at baseline. Our study suggests that the effects of IFX might be partially mediated by enriching bacteria taxa that producing SCFAs and BSH thereby inhibiting inflammation and restoring the BA metabolism. Some fecal bacteria and metabolites may be predictive of outcomes of IFX therapy for pediatric CD patients.

  Title: Extracellular DNA Correlates with Intestinal Inflammation in Chemically Induced Colitis in Mice.
  Abstract: Circulating extracellular DNA (ecDNA) is known to worsen the outcome of many diseases. ecDNA released from neutrophils during infection or inflammation is present in the form of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). It has been shown that higher ecDNA concentration occurs in a number of inflammatory diseases including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Enzymes such as peptidyl arginine deiminases (PADs) are crucial for NET formation. We sought to describe the dynamics of ecDNA concentrations and fragmentation, along with NETosis during a mouse model of chemically induced colitis. Plasma ecDNA concentration was highest on day seven of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) intake and the increase was time-dependent. This increase correlated with the percentage of cells undergoing NETosis and other markers of disease activity. Relative proportion of nuclear ecDNA increased towards more severe colitis; however, absolute amount decreased. In colon explant medium, the highest concentration of ecDNA was on day three of DSS consumption. Early administration of PAD4 inhibitors did not alleviate disease activity, but lowered the ecDNA concentration. These results uncover the biological characteristics of ecDNA in IBD and support the role of ecDNA in intestinal inflammation. The therapeutic intervention aimed at NETs and/or nuclear ecDNA has yet to be fully investigated.

  Title: Substantial Epstein-Barr virus reactivation in a case of severe refractory ulcerative colitis: a possible role in exacerbation.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease that causes chronic inflammation in the colon. 5-aminosalicylic acid and immunosuppressive medications such as corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biologic agents are used to treat these patients. However, patients with UC who receive immunosuppressive medications may be at risk for certain opportunistic infections. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is one of those opportunistic infections, and its pathogenic role has been implicated in refractory UC, but its pathogenicity should be further investigated. Here, we report a surgical case of refractory UC that demonstrated a serologically post-infected pattern of EBV at admission but that later had a high load of EBV in both the peripheral blood and colonic mucosa. These findings suggest that EBV may have been reactivated in the colon, after which it damaged the colonic mucosa and aggravated inflammation in this patient with UC. Thus, EBV might lead to severity and a refractory response against corticosteroids and anti-TNFα agents, necessitating emergency surgery. Viral surveillance for EBV in patients with refractory UC may facilitate understanding of the patient's pathophysiology and predicting response to medications, and the development of antiviral intervention for those patients may improve their prognosis.

  Title: Isotype-specific Antibody Responses to Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis Antigens Are Associated With the Use of Biologic Therapy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Abstract: The role of Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis [MAP] in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], especially Crohn's disease [CD] is controversial due conflicting results and lack of reproducibility and standardised tests. The current study focuses on the role of MAP in disease progression and genetic susceptibility, as MAP is likely one of many factors involved in the complex pathogenesis of IBD, potentially affecting a subgroup depending on genetic susceptibility.Serum from 812 patients was evaluated with seven immunoglobulin [Ig] isotype-specific serology tests assessing humoral response to three different MAP antigens. For each of these in total 21 tests, the intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients were used to evaluate test accuracy. Reliable assays were subsequently analysed in relation to disease characteristics and need for biologic therapy/surgery. Genome-wide genotyping was available for all participants. Genetic determinants of humoral response to MAP antigens were evaluated using genome-wide association analysis and polygenic risk scores [PRS].High IgA or IgM response to MAP2609 was associated with increased use of biologic therapy in CD and ulcerative colitis [UC] [odds ratios 2.69; 95% confidence interval 1.44-5.01; and 2.60, 1.46-4.64, respectively]. No associations were seen for risk of surgery [p-values > 0.29]. We could not identify genetic determinants nor polygenic risk scores for MAP response with genome-wide significance.Extensive assays for serological response to MAP were evaluated using stringent criteria for reliability. Increased IgA and IgM response to MAP antigens was seen in patients exposed to biologic therapy, but no genetic determinants underlying this humoral response were found.© The Author(s) 2020.

  Title: Olfactory Ecto-Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes Ameliorate Experimental Colitis via Modulating Th1/Th17 and Treg Cell Responses.
  Abstract: Olfactory ecto-mesenchymal stem cells (OE-MSCs) are a novel population of resident stem cells in the olfactory lamina propria with strong immunosuppressive function. Exosomes released by MSCs are considered to carry various mRNAs, microRNAs and proteins from cells and function as an extension of MSCs. However, it remains unclear whether exosomes derived from OE-MSCs (OE-MSCs-Exos) possess any immunoregulatory functions. In this study, we found that OE-MSCs-Exos possessed strong suppressive function in CD4+T cell proliferation, accompanied by reduced IL-17, IFN-γ and enhanced TGF-β, IL-10 secreted by T cells. In experimental colitis mice, treatment of OE-MSCs-Exos markedly alleviated the severity of disease, and Th1/Th17 subpopulations were remarkably reduced whereas Treg cells were increased after OE-MSCs-Exos treatment. Mechanistically, OE-MSCs-Exos were demonstrated to inhibit the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells, but promote the induction of Treg cells in vitro. Taken together, our findings identified a novel function of OE-MSCs-Exos in regulating T-cell responses, indicating that OE-MSCs-Exos may represent a new cell-free therapy for the treatment of IBD and other inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2020 Tian, Zhu, Zhang, Bian, Hong, Shen, Xu, Rui, Yin and Wang.

In this study, we found that OE-MSCs-Exos possessed strong suppressive function in CD4+T cell proliferation, accompanied by reduced IL-17, IFN-γ and enhanced TGF-β, IL-10 secreted by T cells. In experimental colitis mice, treatment of OE-MSCs-Exos markedly alleviated the severity of disease, and Th1/Th17 subpopulations were remarkably reduced whereas Treg cells were increased after OE-MSCs-Exos treatment. Mechanistically, OE-MSCs-Exos were demonstrated to inhibit the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells, but promote the induction of Treg cells in vitro. Taken together, our findings identified a novel function of OE-MSCs-Exos in regulating T-cell responses, indicating that OE-MSCs-Exos may represent a new cell-free therapy for the treatment of IBD and other inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2020 Tian, Zhu, Zhang, Bian, Hong, Shen, Xu, Rui, Yin and Wang.

  Title: Dilodendron bipinnatum Radlk. extract alleviates ulcerative colitis induced by TNBS in rats by reducing inflammatory cell infiltration, TNF-α and IL-1β concentrations, IL-17 and COX-2 expressions, supporting mucus production and promotes an antioxidant effect.
  Abstract: Dilodendron bipinnatum (Sapindaceae) stem bark decoction and macerate were used to treat uterine inflammation, pain in general, dermatitis and bone fractures. These homemade preparations also have diuretic, stimulant, expectorants and sedative effects and are effective in treating worm infections in the Brazilian Pantanal population. Our previous research confirmed the anti-inflammatory activity of the hydroethanolic extract of inner stem bark of D. bipinnatum (HEDb).This work aimed to investigate the efficacy of HEDb in ameliorating experimental colitis in rats and to elucidate the possible mechanisms involved in the anti-ulcerative colitis properties of HEDb in rats and Caco-2 cell line.The effects on cell viability, IL-8 and TNF-α in human colon adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) were determined by flow cytometer and ELISA. Wistar rats (n = 6-7) were orally gavaged with, vehicle (0.9% saline), HEDb at doses of 20, 100 or 500 mg/kg, or mesalazine at a dose of 500 mg/kg, at 48, 24 and 1 h prior to the administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid via rectal administration to induce colitis. The anti-inflammatory effects of HEDb were assessed macroscopically, by myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and for glutathione (GSH) concentration in the colon. Additionally, colonic histopathological analyses of UC severity were conducted by different staining methods (H&E, PAS and toluidine blue). Pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β were quantified in colonic tissue by ELISA and colonic expressions of COX-2 and IL-17 were analyzed by western blotting.HEDb was shown to be non-cytotoxic with mean viability of 80% in Caco-2 cells. HEDb pre-treatments of 1, 5 or 20 μg/mL significantly reduced TNF-α production in Caco-2 cells by 21.8% (p < 0.05), 60.5 and 82.1% (p < 0.001) respectively following LPS treatment compared to LPS alone. However, no change in IL-8 production was observed. HEDb pre-treatment of rats subjected to TNBS significantly (p < 0.001) reduced colonic lesion score. Higher doses (100 and 500 mg/kg) caused a sharp downregulation of haemorrhagic damage, leukocyte infiltration, edema and restoration of mucus production. Moreover, mast cell degranulation was inhibited. Colonic MPO activity was reduced following all doses of HEDb, reaching 51.1% ± 1.51 (p < 0.05) with the highest dose. GSH concentration was restored by 58% and 70% following 100 and 500 mg/kg of HEDb, respectively. The oral treatment of HEDb at doses 20, 100 and 500 mg/kg decreased the concentrations of TNF-α and IL-1β at all doses in comparison to vehicle treated control. In addition, HEDb inhibited the COX-2 and IL-17 expressions with maximal effect at 500 mg/kg (60.3% and 65% respectively; p < 0.001). In all trials,

  Title: Real-World Infliximab Pharmacokinetic Study Informs an Electronic Health Record-Embedded Dashboard to Guide Precision Dosing in Children with Crohn's Disease.
  Abstract: Standard-of-care infliximab dosing regimens were developed prior to the routine use of therapeutic drug monitoring and identification of target concentrations. Not surprisingly, subtherapeutic infliximab concentrations in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) are common. The primary aim was to conduct a real-world pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation to discover blood biomarkers of rapid clearance, identify exposure targets, and a secondary aim to translate PK modeling to the clinic. In a multicenter observational study, 671 peak and trough infliximab concentrations from 78 patients with CD were analyzed with a drug-tolerant assay (Esoterix; LabCorp, Calabasas, CA). Individual area under the curve (AUC) estimates were generated as a measure of drug exposure over time. Population PK modeling (nonlinear mixed-effect modeling) identified serum albumin, antibody to infliximab, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and neutrophil CD64 as biomarkers for drug clearance. Week 14 and week 52 biochemical remitters (fecal calprotectin < 250 µg/g) had higher infliximab exposure (AUC) throughout induction. The optimal infliximab AUC target during induction for week 14 biochemical remission was 79,348 µg*h/mL (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) 0.77, [0.63-0.90], 85.7% sensitive, and 64.3% specific) with those exceeding the AUC target more likely to achieve a surgery-free week 52 biochemical remission (OR 4.3, [1.2-14.6]). Pretreatment predictors for subtherapeutic week 14 AUC included neutrophil CD64 > 6 (OR 4.5, [1.4-17.8]), ESR > 30 mm/h (OR 3.8, [1.4-11]), age < 10 years old (OR 4.2, [1.2-20]), and weight < 30 kg (OR 6.6, [2.1-25]). We created a decision-support PK dashboard with an iterative process and embedded the modeling program within the electronic health record. Model-informed precision dosing guided by real-world PKs is now available at the bedside in real-time.© 2020 The Authors.

  Title: Study on the clinical mechanism of Tong-Xie-An-Chang Decoction in the treatment of diarrheal irritable bowel syndrome based on single-cell sequencing technology.
  Abstract: Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is a kind of functional gastrointestinal disorder with obscure pathogenesis, and exploration about differential gene expression and cell heterogeneity of T lymphocytes in peripheral blood in IBS-D patients still remains unknown. Clinicians tend to use symptomatic treatment, but the efficacy is unstable and symptoms are prone to relapse. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is used frequently in IBS-D with stable and lower adverse effects. Tong-Xie-An-Chang Decoction (TXACD) has been proven to be effective in the treatment of IBS-D. However, the underlying therapeutic mechanism remains unclear. This trial aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of TXACD in IBS-D and elucidate the gene-level mechanism of IBS-D and therapeutic targets of TXACD based on single-cell sequencing technology.This is a randomized controlled, double-blind, double-simulation clinical trial in which 72 eligible participants with IBS-D and TCM syndrome of liver depression and spleen deficiency will be randomly allocated in the ratio of 1:1 to two groups: the experimental group and the control group. The experimental group receives Tong-Xie-An-Chang Decoction (TXACD) and Pinaverium bromide tablets placebo; the control group receives pinaverium bromide tablets and TXACD placebo. Each group will be treated for 4 weeks. The primary outcome: the rate of IBS-Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS). The secondary outcomes: TCM syndrome score, adequate relief and IBS-Quality of Life Questionnaire (IBS-QOL). Mechanistic outcome is the single-cell sequencing profiling of the T lymphocytes in peripheral blood from IBS-D participants before and after the treatment and healthy individuals.This trial will prove the efficacy and safety of TXACD with high-quality evidence and provide a comprehensive perspective on the molecular mechanism of IBS-D by single-cell sequencing profiling, which makes us pinpoint specific biomarkers of IBS-D and therapeutic targets of TXACD.Copyright © 2020 the Author(s).

  Title: Suppression of Th17 cell differentiation via sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 by cinnamaldehyde can ameliorate ulcerative colitis.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is chronic disease characterized by diffuse inflammation of the mucosa of the colon and rectum. Although the etiology is unknown, dysregulation of the intestinal mucosal immune system is closely related to UC. Cinnamaldehyde (CA) is a major active compound from cinnamon, is known as its anti-inflammatory and antibacterial. However, little research focused on its regulatory function on immune cells in UC. Therefore, we set out to explore the modulating effects of CA on immune cells in UC. We found that CA reduced the progression of colitis through controlling the production of proinflammatory cytokines and inhibiting the proportion of Th17 cells. Furthermore, the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method was employed for analyzing and differentiating metabolites, data showed that sphingolipid pathway has a great influence on the effect of CA on UC. Meanwhile, sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1P2) and Rho-GTP protein levels were downregulated in colonic tissues after CA treatment. Moreover, in vitro assays showed that CA inhibited Th17 cell differentiation and downregulated of S1P2 and Rho-GTP signaling. Notably, we found that treatment with S1P2 antagonist (JTE-013) weakened the inhibitory effect of CA on Th17 cells. Furthermore, S1P2 deficiency (S1P2-/-) blocked the effect of CA on Th17 cell differentiation. In addition, CA can also improve inflammation via lncRNA H19 and MIAT. To sum up, this study provides clear evidence that CA can ameliorate ulcerative colitis through suppressing Th17 cells via S1P2 pathway and regulating lncRNA H19 and MIAT, which further supports S1P2 as a potential drug target for immunity-mediated UC.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

  Title: B-cell activating factor (BAFF) expression is associated with Crohn's disease and can serve as a potential prognostic indicator of disease response to Infliximab treatment.
  Abstract: Several studies correlated elevated B-cell activating factor (BAFF) levels and its polymorphisms (SNPs) in patients with autoimmunity. Limited data existed regarding the role of BAFF in Crohn's Disease (CD) susceptibility and/or treatment response to infliximab.This study aims to evaluate BAFF expression in CD patients, investigate if its expression can predict response to infliximab treatment, and examine the association of BAFF SNPs with CD susceptibility.One hundred twelve CD patients and 164 healthy controls were recruited. Serum BAFF levels were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Participants were genotyped for rs9514828, rs1041569 and rs2893321 SNPs.Serum BAFF concentration was elevated in CD patients (472.86 ± 223.60 pg/ml) compared with controls (128.16 ± 70.10 pg/ml) before treatment. Responders to IFX treatment had increased serum BAFF levels at baseline (610.03 ± 167.55 pg/ml) compared to non-responders (267.09 ± 107 pg/ml). In responders, BAFF concentration reduced after IFX administration, while increased in non-responders. The rs1041569, TA and AA genotypes frequencies, and the minor allele A were increased significantly in CD patients, indicating an association of the SNP with CD susceptibility.Our study suggests that BAFF could be a potential biomarker of CD, while SNP rs1041569 was associated with CD susceptibility.Copyright © 2020 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

  Title: B-cell activating factor (BAFF) expression is associated with Crohn's disease and can serve as a potential prognostic indicator of disease response to Infliximab treatment.
  Abstract: Several studies correlated elevated B-cell activating factor (BAFF) levels and its polymorphisms (SNPs) in patients with autoimmunity. Limited data existed regarding the role of BAFF in Crohn's Disease (CD) susceptibility and/or treatment response to infliximab.This study aims to evaluate BAFF expression in CD patients, investigate if its expression can predict response to infliximab treatment, and examine the association of BAFF SNPs with CD susceptibility.One hundred twelve CD patients and 164 healthy controls were recruited. Serum BAFF levels were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Participants were genotyped for rs9514828, rs1041569 and rs2893321 SNPs.Serum BAFF concentration was elevated in CD patients (472.86 ± 223.60 pg/ml) compared with controls (128.16 ± 70.10 pg/ml) before treatment. Responders to IFX treatment had increased serum BAFF levels at baseline (610.03 ± 167.55 pg/ml) compared to non-responders (267.09 ± 107 pg/ml). In responders, BAFF concentration reduced after IFX administration, while increased in non-responders. The rs1041569, TA and AA genotypes frequencies, and the minor allele A were increased significantly in CD patients, indicating an association of the SNP with CD susceptibility.Our study suggests that BAFF could be a potential biomarker of CD, while SNP rs1041569 was associated with CD susceptibility.Copyright © 2020 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

  Title: Dapsone-induced DRESS after infliximab-induced vasculitis: a case of cerebral infarction in the context of multiple drug reactions.
  Abstract: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a life-threatening condition characterised by peripheral eosinophilia, rash and multi-organ failure arising several weeks after exposure to the culprit medication. Although rare, DRESS syndrome triggered by specific agents has been associated with specific genetic polymorphisms more prevalent in different ethnic groups, including an association between dapsone-induced DRESS and Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-B:13*01, a single nucleotide polymorphism more prevalent in those of Asian descent. DRESS and drug-related vasculitis may affect any organ system including the central nervous system (CNS), usually manifesting as encephalitis, meningitis or embolic cerebrovascular accidents related to eosinophilic cardiac disease and thrombosis. CNS vasculitis is a much rarer complication of drug reactions that may manifest as multifocal ischemia on neuroimaging. In circumstances of drug-related vasculitides, treatment with high-dose corticosteroids may lead to rapid improvement and, ultimately, resolution of associated focal neurologic deficits.© BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2020.

  Title: Thiomyristoyl ameliorates colitis by blocking the differentiation of Th17 cells and inhibiting SIRT2-induced metabolic reprogramming.
  Abstract: The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) has not been fully elucidated. However, a strong correlation between IBD and high T helper 17 (Th17) levels has been found. Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) has recently been found to play an important role in metabolic reprogramming, but its potential anti-inflammatory properties remain unclear.The expression levels of SIRT2 and glucose metabolism-related proteins in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of IBD patients and healthy volunteers were detected. Human PBMCs were differentiated into Th17 cells in vitro and were treated with TM simultaneously. The ratio of Th17 cells and apoptotic cells and the production of Interleukin (IL)-17A and the expression levels of transcription factors of classical signaling pathway related to Th17 differentiation were determined. The acetylation of LDHA and glucose metabolism was assessed. Subsequently, C57BL/6J colitis mice induced by 2.5% dextran sulfatesodiumsalt (DSS) were treated with or without TM, Disease activity index, T cell subsets in the mice spleen, relevant inflammatory cytokines in serum, specific mRNA, and proteins in mice colon were evaluated respectively.SIRT2 and glucose metabolism-related proteins in PBMCs of patients were overexpressed. Compared with the positive control group, human PBMCs treated with TM had lower levels of IL-17A, percentage of Th17 cells, levels of phospho-signal transducer and activator of transcription (p-STAT) 3 and phospho-nuclear transcription factor-κB (p-NF-κB), but higher levels of acetylated LDHA. Compared with colitis mice, TM-treated colitis mice had longer colons, reduced weight-losses, and lower disease activity index and histopathologic scores. Interestingly, although the expression levels of interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-17A, and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor (ROR)-γt were inhibited in the colons of TM-treated colitis mice, the expression of forkhead box protein P3 (FOXP3) didn't change. Consistently, relative to the high percentage of splenic Th17 cells in colitis mice, the percentage of splenic Th17 cells in TM-treated colitis mice was as normal as PBS-treated mice, while the percentage of Treg cells was not affected. Additionally, the TM group had reduced levels of IL-23 and hypoxiainduciblefactor-1α (HIF-1α), and an increased level of IL-10 in the colon, compared with the colitis group.Our results indicate that TM reduces UC progression by reducing metabolic reprogramming and T cell differentiation. Specifically, TM prevented Th17 differentiation by reducing the expression of related transcription factors and promoting acetylation of LDHA (weakening glycolysis). SIRT2 may be a potential target for IBD treatment.Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

  Title: [Mesalazine-induced myocarditis].
  Abstract: A 30-year-old man presented with constipation and abdominal pain. He was suspected of having ulcerative colitis, and administration of 2400mg/day of oral mesalazine was initiated. After 10 days of treatment, he experienced fever and chest pain. Blood examination, electrocardiography, and cardiac ultrasonography revealed elevated cardiac enzymes, ST-segment elevation, and diffuse hypokinesis, respectively. Mesalazine-induced acute myocarditis was diagnosed based on a positive drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test and the absence of other myocarditis-causing conditions. Prompt cessation of mesalazine quickly improved his heart function and test results. Although rare, clinicians should consider the possibility of cardiac adverse events caused by mesalazine.

  Title: The Role of Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 as a Therapeutic Target and Serum Biomarker in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review.
  Abstract: The roles dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), aminopeptidase N (APN), and their substrates in autoimmune diseases are being increasingly recognized. However, their significance in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is not entirely understood. This systematic review aims to discuss the pathophysiological processes related to these ectopeptidases while comparing findings from preclinical and clinical settings.This review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. We performed a literature search in PubMed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science to identify all reports from inception until February 2020. The search included validated animal models of intestinal inflammation and studies in IBD patients. Quality assessment was performed using SYRCLE's risk of bias tool and CASP qualitative and cohort checklists.From the 45 included studies, 36 were performed in animal models and 12 in humans (3 reports included both). Overall, the methodological quality of preclinical studies was acceptable. In animal models, DPP4 and APN inhibition significantly improved intestinal inflammation.Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 and GLP-2 analogs and GLP-2-relase-inducing drugs also showed significant benefits in recovery from inflammatory damage. A nonsignificant trend toward disease remission with the GLP-2 analog teduglutide was observed in the sole interventional human study. All human studies reported an inverse correlation between soluble DPP4/CD26 levels and disease severity, in accordance with the proposal of DPP4 as a biomarker for IBD.The use of DPP4 inhibitors and analogs of its substrates has clear benefits in the treatment of experimentally induced intestinal inflammation. Further research is warranted to validate their potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications in IBD patients.© 2020 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press.

  Title: Mesalazine granule formulation improves clinical data in Crohn's disease compared with tablet formulation.
  Abstract: The efficacy of sustained-release preparations of mesalazine as a remission maintenance treatment for Crohn's disease remains to be established. We aimed to examine the changes in compliance rate and clinical data 2 years after switching from mesalazine tablet to granule formulation at our facility among patients with Crohn's disease in remission. We investigated the rate of continuous treatment of mesalazine granules and examined the changes in Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, and hemoglobin (Hb) levels 2 years after the switch. Compliance rate (continuous treatment vs. additional treatment) and continuous treatment rate [good (rate of ≥ 70%) vs. poor (rate < 70%)] were investigated. Of 46 patients, 12 (27.3%) received additional treatment and 32 (72.7%) did not require additional treatment in 2 years. No significant change in CDAI after switching to granule modification was noted in 32 patients in the continuous treatment group. Nevertheless, clinical remission was maintained for 2 years, and serum CRP levels decreased significantly (P = 0.023) and Hb levels increased significantly (P = 0.002). No change in the compliance rate was found. Our results suggest that mesalazine granule formulation may have a remission maintenance effect that is superior to that of mesalazine tablets.

  Title: Comparison of three commercially available ELISA assays for anti-infliximab antibodies.
  Abstract: Three commercially available assays for the measurement of antibodies to infliximab (ATI) are approved for clinical use in Australia: Promonitor anti-infliximab (Grifols), Lisa Tracker anti-infliximab (Theradiag) and Ridascreen anti-IFX (R-Biopharm). All are bridging ELISA assays. Measurement of ATI has been incorporated into treatment algorithms for assessing loss of response to infliximab in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, but results obtained by the three ATI assays have not been systematically compared. We performed a series of experiments to allow comparison of results between the assays. Forty-two patient samples known to be positive for ATI by the Lisa Tracker assay were run on the Promonitor assay in singlicate, of which 26 were run on the Ridascreen assay in duplicate, according to the manufacturers' instructions. The Spearman correlation coefficient for all three pairwise assay comparisons was 0.95. Results were not numerically comparable between the assays. The coefficient of variation (CV) was 2.3% for the Lisa Tracker assay, 7.6% for the Promonitor assay and 7.4% for the Ridascreen assay. The presence of infliximab interfered with all three assays in a dose dependent manner. The cut-point for loss of response to infliximab dose intensification, previously demonstrated to be 200 ng/mL on the Lisa Tracker assay, is equivalent to approximately 60 ng/mL on the Ridascreen assay and between 22.9 and 41 AU/mL on the Promonitor assay. All three assays are suitable for clinical use.Crown Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Forty-two patient samples known to be positive for ATI by the Lisa Tracker assay were run on the Promonitor assay in singlicate, of which 26 were run on the Ridascreen assay in duplicate, according to the manufacturers' instructions. The Spearman correlation coefficient for all three pairwise assay comparisons was 0.95. Results were not numerically comparable between the assays. The coefficient of variation (CV) was 2.3% for the Lisa Tracker assay, 7.6% for the Promonitor assay and 7.4% for the Ridascreen assay. The presence of infliximab interfered with all three assays in a dose dependent manner. The cut-point for loss of response to infliximab dose intensification, previously demonstrated to be 200 ng/mL on the Lisa Tracker assay, is equivalent to approximately 60 ng/mL on the Ridascreen assay and between 22.9 and 41 AU/mL on the Promonitor assay. All three assays are suitable for clinical use.Crown Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

  Title: Exploring the Potential Mechanism of Guchang Zhixie Wan for Treating Ulcerative Colitis by Comprehensive Network Pharmacological Approaches and Molecular Docking Validation as Well as Cell Experiments.
  Abstract: Guchang Zhixie Wan (GZW) is a commonly used Chinese medicine for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). This research explored the potential pharmacological mechanism of GZW in UC. The active ingredients, potential targets, and UC-related genes of GZW were retrieved from public databases. The pharmacological mechanisms including key components, potential targets and signal pathways were determined through bioinformatics analysis. The results of this study were verified through virtual molecular docking and cell experiments. Network analysis revealed that 26 active GZW compounds and 148 potential GZW target proteins were associated with UC. Quercetin, kaempferol and β-sitosterol were identified as the core active ingredients of GZW. IFNG, IL-1A, IL-1B, JUN, RELA, and STAT1 were indicated as key targets of GZW. These key targets have a strong affinity for quercetin, kaempferol, and β-sitosterol. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis showed that GZW target proteins are highly enriched in inflammatory, immune, and oxidative stress-related pathways. This study confirmed the therapeutic effect and revealed potential molecular mechanism of GZW on UC. And the protective effects of GZW on inflammatory bowel disease pathway were also revealed through STAT3/NF-κB/IL-6 pathway. The findings of this study enhanced our understanding of GZW in the treatment of UC and provided a feasible method for discovering potential drugs from traditional Chinese medicine formulations.© 2020 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland.

  Title: Tissue Exposure does not Explain Non-Response in Ulcerative Colitis Patients with Adequate Serum Vedolizumab Concentrations.
  Abstract: Some patients with ulcerative colitis [UC] do not respond to vedolizumab treatment despite adequate drug exposure in serum. This study aimed to investigate vedolizumab in tissue and questioned whether insufficient tissue exposure could explain non-response in UC patients with adequate serum vedolizumab concentrations.A paired serum sample and colonic mucosal biopsy was collected from 40 UC patients [20 endoscopic responders, 20 non-responders] at week 14 of vedolizumab treatment. Vedolizumab, soluble [s]-mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 [MAdCAM-1], s-vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 [VCAM-1] and s-intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1] were measured in serum and/or tissue. Endoscopic response was defined as Mayo endoscopic sub-score ≤1.A significant positive correlation was observed between vedolizumab serum and colonic tissue concentrations [ρ = 0.84, p < 0.0001], regardless of the macroscopic inflammatory state of the tissue. Vedolizumab tissue concentrations were lower in non-responders than in responders [0.07 vs 0.11 µg/mg, p = 0.04]. In the subgroup of patients with adequate vedolizumab serum concentrations [>14.6 µg/mL], tissue vedolizumab was not significantly different between responders and non-responders [0.15 vs 0.13 µg/mg; p = 0.92]. Serum sMAdCAM-1 concentrations, but not serum sICAM-1 or sVCAM-1 concentrations, were significantly higher in responders than in non-responders with adequate vedolizumab serum concentrations [1.04 vs 0.83 ng/mL, p = 0.03].Vedolizumab concentrations in colonic mucosal tissue of UC patients reflect the concentration in serum regardless of the macroscopic inflammatory state of the tissue. Our data show that insufficient tissue exposure does not explain non-response in UC patients with adequate serum vedolizumab concentrations.© The Author(s) 2020.

  Title: Hydroalcoholic extract of Tagetes minuta L. inhibits inflammatory bowel disease through the activity of pheophytins on the NF-κB signalling pathway.
  Abstract: Species of the genus Tagetes are well known for their anti-inflammatory properties. Tagetes minuta "Huacatay" is an endemic species of South America that has been used in traditional medicine since ancient times as a remedy for stomach and intestinal discomfort.The aim of this study is to investigate the anti-inflammatory activity of the aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts of the Huacatay, identifying the compounds responsible for this activity.Anti-inflammatory activity of the compounds, fractions and extracts was evaluated in Hs 746T (stomach), HIEC-6 (intestine) and THP-1 (monocytes peripheral blood) cells by measuring their inhibitory capacity against the NF-κB production.Aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts of Tagetes minuta displayed anti-inflammatory activity in vitro, the hydroalcoholic extract being the most active (IC50 between 59.72 and 66.42 μg/mL) in all cell lines. Bio-guided hydroalcoholic extract fractionation led to the isolation and characterisation of two pheophytins, pheophytin a (1) and 132-hydroxy pheophytin a (2). Both compounds inhibited the production of NF-κB with IC50 values in the low micromolar range, with an IC50 between 12.32 and 16.01 μM for compound 1 and 7.91-9.87 μM for compound 2.The two pheophytins isolated in this study inhibit the production of NF-κB, thus showing that the traditional anti-inflammatory use of Tagetes minuta can be proved through pharmacological assays. This contributes to understanding the anti-inflammatory activity of the Huacatay extracts and their use in the treatment of stomach and intestinal discomfort.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Twenty-three CD patients had BS at the time of first and second application. BS was performed by one of 2 experienced DEGUM certificated sonographers, with evaluation by both independently and blindly. Primary endpoint was substantial sonographic response defined as decrease of BWT ≥ 1 mm. Secondary endpoint was concordance between sonographic and clinical response, defined as decrease of CDAI ≥ 70 points and sonographic and biochemical response defined as decrease of CRP ≥ 0.5 mg/dl. At week 8, BS detected in 10 of 23 patients a substantial decrease of BWT ≥ 1 mm; in 7, a decrease < 1 mm. Compared to baseline, all 17 patients showed generally improved blood data and 16/17 generally improved clinical data. Of those with a decrease of BWT ≥ 1 mm, we observed a substantial decrease of CDAI ≥ 70 points in 9/10 patients and a substantial decrease of CRP ≥ 0.5 mg/dl in 8/10 patients. Our study suggests that sonographic measurement of BWT can be a helpful parameter for selecting patients responding early to ustekinumab and for providing assistance in terms of further treatment interval at week 8.Thieme.

  Title: Ileal Transcriptomic Analysis in Paediatric Crohn's Disease Reveals IL17- and NOD-signalling Expression Signatures in Treatment-naïve Patients and Identifies Epithelial Cells Driving Differentially Expressed Genes.
  Abstract: Crohn's disease [CD] arises through host-environment interaction. Abnormal gene expression results from disturbed pathway activation or response to bacteria. We aimed to determine activated pathways and driving cell types in paediatric CD.We employed contemporary targeted autoimmune RNA sequencing, in parallel to single-cell sequencing, to ileal tissue derived from paediatric CD and controls. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis [WGCNA] was performed and differentially expressed genes [DEGs] were determined. We integrated clinical data to determine co-expression modules associated with outcomes.In all, 27 treatment-naive CD [TN-CD], 26 established CD patients and 17 controls were included. WGCNA revealed a 31-gene signature characterising TN-CD patients, but not established CD, nor controls. The CSF3R gene is a hub within this module and is key in neutrophil expansion and differentiation. Antimicrobial genes, including S100A12 and the calprotectin subunit S100A9, were significantly upregulated in TN CD compared with controls [p = 2.61 x 10-15 and p = 9.13 x 10-14, respectively] and established CD [both p = 0.0055]. Gene-enrichment analysis confirmed upregulation of the IL17-, NOD- and Oncostatin-M-signalling pathways in TN-CD patients, identified in both WGCNA and DEG analyses. An upregulated gene signature was enriched for transcripts promoting Th17-cell differentiation and correlated with prolonged time to relapse [correlation-coefficient-0.36, p = 0.07]. Single-cell sequencing of TN-CD patients identified specialised epithelial cells driving differential expression of S100A9. Cell groups, determined by single-cell gene expression, demonstrated enrichment of IL17-signalling in monocytes and epithelial cells.Ileal tissue from treatment-naïve paediatric patients is significantly upregulated for genes driving IL17-, NOD- and Oncostatin-M-signalling. This signal is driven by a distinct subset of epithelial cells expressing antimicrobial gene transcripts.© The Author(s) 2020.

  Title: Mycosis fungoides in a patient with ulcerative colitis on anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha therapy.
  Abstract: A 46-year-old man with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC) for over 25 years was treated with infliximab for 7 years. He noticed gradually spreading erythema on his right lower abdomen, femur, and buttocks. Skin biopsy from the right lower abdomen revealed massive invasion of lymphocytes in the papillary dermis and epidermal layer. In conjunction with the findings of immunohistochemistry, the skin lesion was diagnosed as mycosis fungoides (MF) at infiltration stage. Infliximab was discontinued, and narrow-band ultraviolet light B therapy was initiated to treat the skin lesion. The patient achieved remission for MF following treatment and UC has not relapsed for more than 1 year with 5-aminosalicylic acid treatment alone. This is the first case of MF in a UC patient treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNFα). Lymphoma occurrence is a complication of treatment with anti-TNFα agent or thiopurine. However, there is no evidence regarding the relationship between MF and UC. Hence, these immunomodulatory agents may have triggered the occurrence of MF in this case. When treating UC patients with immunomodulatory agents, the possibility of MF or other types of lymphoma as rare complications must be considered.

  Title: Mycosis fungoides in a patient with ulcerative colitis on anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha therapy.
  Abstract: A 46-year-old man with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC) for over 25 years was treated with infliximab for 7 years. He noticed gradually spreading erythema on his right lower abdomen, femur, and buttocks. Skin biopsy from the right lower abdomen revealed massive invasion of lymphocytes in the papillary dermis and epidermal layer. In conjunction with the findings of immunohistochemistry, the skin lesion was diagnosed as mycosis fungoides (MF) at infiltration stage. Infliximab was discontinued, and narrow-band ultraviolet light B therapy was initiated to treat the skin lesion. The patient achieved remission for MF following treatment and UC has not relapsed for more than 1 year with 5-aminosalicylic acid treatment alone. This is the first case of MF in a UC patient treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNFα). Lymphoma occurrence is a complication of treatment with anti-TNFα agent or thiopurine. However, there is no evidence regarding the relationship between MF and UC. Hence, these immunomodulatory agents may have triggered the occurrence of MF in this case. When treating UC patients with immunomodulatory agents, the possibility of MF or other types of lymphoma as rare complications must be considered.

  Title: Thalidomide Inhibits Angiogenesis via Downregulation of VEGF and Angiopoietin-2 in Crohn's Disease.
  Abstract: Immune-mediated angiogenesis is important in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease and targeted treatment could alleviate the disease. Thalidomide is an effective drug in inflammatory bowel disease, which might be related to its multiple role in anti-inflammatory, immunoregulatory, and anti-angiogenesis. This study is to investigate the effect of thalidomide on angiogenesis in tissues from patients and in vitro cells. Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), VEGF, and CD31 expressions in intestinal mucosa from pediatric CD patients before and after thalidomide treatment were measured by immunohistochemistry. Western blotting and polymerase chain reaction were performed to characterize the change of angiogenic factors before and after treatment in remission. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated by thalidomide were used to examine its effect on endothelial cell proliferation and migration and capillary-like structures. Results showed that VEGF and Ang-2 levels were significantly greater in CD patients over controls. Thalidomide produced a significant reduction in protein expression of Ang-2 and VEGF, along with a decrease in mRNA expression of Ang-2. While, Ang-1 level did not show a statistically significant change. Thalidomide significantly inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. It also suppressed VEGF- and Ang-2-induced cell migration and capillary-like tube formation in HUVECs. Therefore, our study suggests that VEGF and Ang-2 levels are up-regulated in pediatric CD patients. It also indicated that thalidomide can be able to deactivate endothelium by the downregulation effect on angiogenic factors by targeting VEGF and Ang-2.

  Title: Embryonic stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells promote colon epithelial integrity and regeneration by elevating circulating IGF-1 in colitis mice.
  Abstract: Rationale: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) show promising therapeutic potential in treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) due to their immunomodulatory and trophic functions. However, their efficacy is influenced by tissue origin, donator condition, isolation, and expansion methods. Here, we generated phenotypically uniform MSCs from human embryonic stem cells (T-MSCs) and explored the molecular mechanisms involved in promoting mucosal integrity and regeneration in colitis mice. Methods: T-MSCs were injected intravenously into mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, and the in vivo distribution and therapeutic efficacy were evaluated. We performed serum cytokine antibody microarrays to screen potentially effective proteins and examined the therapeutic effect of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Colon epithelial regeneration potential was evaluated, and RNA sequencing was employed to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms. Finally, in vitro IGF-1 stimulation was performed to assess its effect on cell functions and organoid growth. Results: Intravenous administration of T-MSCs alleviated colitis in both acute and chronic DSS mouse models. Labeled T-MSCs were mainly distributed in the lungs, liver, and spleen after systemic infusion. The antibody array analysis of serum cytokines indicated that the IGF-1 level was increased in the treatment group, and serum ELISA further confirmed its elevation in the regeneration stage. Intraperitoneal injection of IGF-1 receptor inhibitors abrogated the anti-inflammatory activity of T-MSCs. The colonic epithelium of the treatment group showed greater regenerative potency than the controls and the IGF1R-PI3K-AKT pathway was up-regulated. RNA sequencing showed that T-MSC treatment contributed to colonic cell integrity and promoted xenobiotic metabolism. In vitro IGF-1 stimulation promoted the growth and proliferation of colon cells and organoids. Conclusions: Intravenous infusion of T-MSCs alleviated colitis in mice by elevating the circulating IGF-1 level. Increased IGF-1 maintained the integrity of epithelial cells and contributed to their repair and regeneration. Our study has identified T- MSCs as a potential cell resource for IBD treatment.© The author(s).

  Title: [Association of Breg cells and Treg cells with the clinical effects of Infliximab in the treatment of Chinese patients with Crohn's disease].
  Abstract: Objective: To explore the associations of regulatory B cells (Breg cells) and regulatory T cells (Treg cells) with the clinical effect of Infliximab in the treatment of Chinese patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Methods: From January 2017 to June 2019, a total of 32 CD patients at active stage and 33 age and gender-matched healthy controls were collected from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University in this study. Approximate 5 ml of peripheral fasting venous blood was obtained from every subject. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from whole blood. Then multi-color flow cytometry was applied to determine the proportion of Breg (CD3-CD19+IL-10+B cells) in B cells and the proportion of Treg (CD4+CD25+Foxp3+T cells) in CD4+T cells. Infliximab (5 mg/kg) was given intravenously at week 0, 2 and 6 to induce CD remission, and then maintained with the same dose of Infliximab every 8 weeks. And the proportions of Breg and Treg were examined at week 14 of Infliximab treatment, then compared with those of week 0. Simultaneously, C-reactive protein (CRP), leucocyte count, platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate were detected in CD patients to assess the clinical effect at week 0 and 14 of Infliximab treatment. Results: Before infliximab treatment, compared with healthy controls, the proportion of Breg in B cells was significantly increased [(3.15±1.17)% vs (2.64±0.38)%, P=0.024)], and the proportion of Treg in CD4+T cells was significantly decreased [(2.15±0.49)% vs (4.25±0.41)%, P<0.001] in CD patients. And the proportion of Breg was positively related with the proportion of Treg in CD patients either at week 0 or week 14 of Infliximab treatment (r=0.628, P<0.001; r=0.749, P<0.001). At week 14 of Infliximab treatment, according to symptoms, Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) and endoscopic mucosal healing, CD patients were classified as remission group (CDAI<150 and endoscopic mucosal healing, R group) and non-remission group (CDAI≥150 or mucosal non-healing group, N group). Compared with CD patients at week 0 of Infliximab treatment, both the proportion of Breg and Treg were significantly enhanced [(5.89±2.60)% vs (3.19±1.27)%, P<0.001; (4.59±0.72)% vs (2.08±0.47)%, P<0.001], whereas CDAI and CRP was significantly reduced [CDAI: (63.19±14.69) vs (195.62±58.13), P<0.001; CRP: (3.65±2.23) mg/L vs (29.80±30.06) mg/L, P<0.001] in R group at week 14 of Infliximab treatment. The proportions of Breg and Treg were negatively related with the CRP (r=-0.279, P=0.026; r=-0.406, P=0.001) and CDAI (r=-0.409, P=0.001; r=-0.708, P<0.001) in CD patients at week 0 and 14 of Infliximab treatment. At week 14 of Infliximab treatment, ROC curve analysis showed that the predictive value of "Breg+Treg" for the effect of Infliximab was higher than the other parameters (a

  Title: Comparison of the ELISA and ECL Assay for Vedolizumab Anti-drug Antibodies: Assessing the Impact on Pharmacokinetics and Safety Outcomes of the Phase 3 GEMINI Trials.
  Abstract: Vedolizumab immunogenicity has been assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a ~ 0.5 μg/mL drug interference, which may underestimate on-drug immunogenicity. We aimed to compare immunogenicity results between ELISA and the new drug-tolerant electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay (and the two versions of neutralizing assays, drug-sensitive versus drug-tolerant). The ECL assay drug tolerance is ~ 100 times higher than that of the ELISA (≥ 50 μg/mL vs. 0.5 μg/mL with a 500 ng/mL positive control), and assay sensitivity is < 5 ng/mL for both assays. Vedolizumab immunogenicity was assessed in 2000 GEMINI 1 and 2 patients originally tested by ELISA and retested by ECL assay. Anti-drug antibody (ADA) impact on infusion-related reactions and pharmacokinetics (PK) was examined using descriptive statistics and population PK analyses. By ECL assay, 6% (86/1427) of patients treated with vedolizumab as induction and maintenance therapy tested ADA-positive. Of these, 20 patients were persistently positive and 56 had neutralizing antibodies. By ELISA, 4% (56/1434) of these patients were ADA-positive, 9 were persistently positive, and 33 had neutralizing antibodies. Among 61 patients with infusion-related reactions, 6 (10%) were ADA-positive (2 persistently positive) by ECL assay. By ELISA, 3 (5%) patients were both ADA-positive and persistently positive. Most results (96%) were similar with both assays. In the updated population PK model, ADA-positive status was estimated to increase vedolizumab linear clearance by a factor of 1.10 (95% credible interval 1.03-1.17), which is consistent with previous reports. The impact of ADA on safety and PK modeling remained generally consistent using either ELISA or ECL assay. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00783718 and NCT00783692.

By ECL assay, 6% (86/1427) of patients treated with vedolizumab as induction and maintenance therapy tested ADA-positive. Of these, 20 patients were persistently positive and 56 had neutralizing antibodies. By ELISA, 4% (56/1434) of these patients were ADA-positive, 9 were persistently positive, and 33 had neutralizing antibodies. Among 61 patients with infusion-related reactions, 6 (10%) were ADA-positive (2 persistently positive) by ECL assay. By ELISA, 3 (5%) patients were both ADA-positive and persistently positive. Most results (96%) were similar with both assays. In the updated population PK model, ADA-positive status was estimated to increase vedolizumab linear clearance by a factor of 1.10 (95% credible interval 1.03-1.17), which is consistent with previous reports. The impact of ADA on safety and PK modeling remained generally consistent using either ELISA or ECL assay. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00783718 and NCT00783692.

  Title: Drug-induced IgA vasculitis in children and adults: Revisiting drug causality using a dual pharmacovigilance-based approach.
  Abstract: IgA vasculitis (IgAV) is an immune complex small-vessel vasculitis. Drug-induced IgAV cases were rarely reported in the literature. Drug causality assessment is challenging as many other etiological factors can be involved. We performed a pharmacovigilance study to identify the main drugs reported to induce IgAV.We used the French pharmacovigilance database (FPVD) and the WHO global individual case safety reports database (VigiBase) to retrieve IgAV cases. Cases from the FPVD were reviewed by two investigators using predefined criteria. Disproportionality analyses (case - non-case approach) were conducted in VigiBase to identify drugs significantly associated with IgAV reporting.Of the 467 IgAV cases retrieved from the FPVD, 115 (47 children and 68 adults) have been assessed as definite or probable, reported with 178 suspected drugs. Overall IgAV cases were mainly male (58%), with a median age of 33.5 (8.0-63.3) years. No death was reported. Besides, we identified 1558 possible IgAV cases in VigiBase. Among them, 40 were associated with a disproportionality in IgAV reporting. Drugs were mainly vaccines, antibiotics and TNF-α blockers, these finding being consistent in both databases. IgAV reporting with TNF-α blockers was significantly associated with their use in inflammatory bowel diseases, psoriasis or ankylosing spondylitis compared to other indications.Our systematic study enables the identification of culprit drugs in drug-induced IgAV. These results strengthen the immune pathophysiology of IgAV and the role of underlying disease. The list of suspected drugs may be useful for physicians to manage patients with IgAV and consider appropriate drug discontinuation.What is already known about this subject? IgA vasculitis has multifactorial etiology. To date, possible culprit drugs have been reported only in case reports. What does this study add? Using a dual pharmacovigilance-based approach, we identified drugs associated with the occurrence of IgA vasculitis, such as all types of vaccines, major antibiotics and immunomodulatory agents, mainly TNF-α blockers. How might this impact on clinical practice or future developments? Physicians should be aware of drug-induced IgA vasculitis and we provide evidence on the most frequent implicated drugs.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

  Title: High incidence of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycaemia in inflammatory bowel disease: metabolic and clinical predictors identified by machine learning.
  Abstract: Glucocorticosteroids (GC) are long-established, widely used agents for induction of remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Hyperglycaemia is a known complication of GC treatment with implications for morbidity and mortality. Published data on prevalence and risk factors for GC-induced hyperglycaemia in the IBD population are limited. We prospectively characterise this complication in our cohort, employing machine-learning methods to identify key predictors of risk.We conducted a prospective observational study of IBD patients receiving intravenous hydrocortisone (IVH). Electronically triggered three times daily capillary blood glucose (CBG) monitoring was recorded alongside diabetes mellitus (DM) history, IBD biomarkers, nutritional and IBD clinical activity scores. Hyperglycaemia was defined as CBG ≥11.1 mmol/L and undiagnosed DM as glycated haemoglobin ≥48 mmol/mol. Random forest (RF) regression models were used to extract predictor-patterns present within the dataset.94 consecutive IBD patients treated with IVH were included. 60% (56/94) of the cohort recorded an episode of hyperglycaemia, including 57% (50/88) of those with no history of DM, of which 19% (17/88) and 5% (4/88) recorded a CBG ≥14 mmol/L and ≥20 mmol/L, respectively. The RF models identified increased C-reactive protein (CRP) followed by a longer IBD duration as leading risk predictors for significant hyperglycaemia.Hyperglycaemia is common in IBD patients treated with intravenous GC. Therefore, CBG monitoring should be included in routine clinical practice. Machine learning methods can identify key risk factors for clinical complications. Steroid-sparing treatment strategies may be considered for those IBD patients with higher admission CRP and greater disease duration, who appear to be at the greatest risk of hyperglycaemia.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

  Title: The protective effect and mechanism of pedunculoside on DSS (dextran sulfate sodium) induced ulcerative colitis in mice.
  Abstract: Pedunculoside (PE) is derived from the bark of iron holly, a member of the holly family. Previous studies have shown that PE has anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antiviral, cholesterol-lowering and blood-pressure-lowering effects. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of PE on ulcerative colitis and to explore its potential mechanisms. We treated a mouse model of ulcerative colitis induced by DSS (dextran sulfate sodium) with PE. The results showed that PE had an obvious effect on DSS-induced ulcerative colitis. PE significantly improved the colon length and clinical score in mice, and significantly inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines. In the LPS-induced inflammatory response of RAW264.7 macrophages, we also found that PE significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT, ERK1/2, JNK1/2, P65, and P38 to reduce the production of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, COX-2, and iNOS. Furthermore, PE suppressed the LPS-induced transcriptional activities of nuclear factor P65 as well as the phosphorylation of P65. In addition, we also studied the effect of PE on LPS induced AKT/NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways with primary peritoneal macrophages. In summary, PE has a beneficial effect on ulcerative colitis, and may be a potential natural product in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

  Title: Circulating exosomes express α4β7 integrin and compete with CD4+ T cells for the binding to Vedolizumab.
  Abstract: Vedolizumab (VDZ) is a therapeutic monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). VDZ selectively binds to the α4β7 integrin and blocks trafficking of a specific subset of gastrointestinal-homing T-lymphocytes to inflamed tissue. Although VDZ has shown promising results in numerous clinical studies a subgroup of patients do not respond adequately. Mechanistic insights and prognostic biomarkers able to predict which patients might benefit from VDZ therapy are currently lacking. Circulating exosomes were isolated from serum of blood donors and VDZ-treated patients by polymer-based precipitation. The surface expression of α4β7 integrin was evaluated by flow cytometry and the levels of exosome-bound VDZ were investigated by Promonitor-VDZ ELISA kit. The capacity of exosomes to interfere with the adhesion of VDZ-treated CD4+ T cells was assessed by adhesion assay. In this study, we showed that serum exosomes isolated from both blood donor and ulcerative colitis patients express on their surface the VDZ target α4β7 integrin. We observed an increased exosomal sequestration of VDZ in anti-TNF exposed patients compared to anti- TNFα naïve patients, according to a greater expression of α4β7 integrin on vesicles surface. Circulating exosomes could compete for VDZ binding with CD4+ T cells since we found that the amount of VDZ bound to T cells was impaired in the presence of exosomes. In addition, we demonstrated that exosomes bind VDZ, which consequently becomes unable to block MadCAM-1-mediated adhesion of lymphocytes. Circulating exosomes might contribute to drug sequestration, possibly affecting the therapeutic efficacy of VDZ in IBD patients. Our data suggest that previous biologic therapy may have altered the sequestration capacity of circulating exosomes, thus reducing the efficacy of VDZ in patients who failed anti-TNF agents.

  Title: Curcumin ameliorates DSS‑induced colitis in mice by regulating the Treg/Th17 signaling pathway.
  Abstract: Curcumin has a therapeutic effect on ulcerative colitis, but the underlying mechanism has yet to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to clarify the possible mechanisms. Dextran sulfate sodium‑induced colitis mice were treated with curcumin via gavage for 7 days. The effects of curcumin on disease activity index (DAI) and pathological changes of colonic tissue in mice were determined. Interleukin (IL)‑6, IL‑10, IL‑17 and IL‑23 expression levels were measured by ELISA. Flow cytometry was used to detect the ratio of mouse spleen regulatory T cells (Treg)/Th17 cells, and western blotting was used to measure the nuclear protein hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)‑1α level. The results demonstrated that curcumin can significantly reduce DAI and spleen index scores and improve mucosal inflammation. Curcumin could also regulate the re‑equilibration of Treg/Th17. IL‑10 level in the colon was significantly increased, while inflammatory cytokines IL‑6, IL‑17 and IL‑23 were significantly reduced following curcumin treatment. No significant difference in HIF‑1α was observed between the colitis and the curcumin group. It was concluded that oral administration of curcumin can effectively treat experimental colitis by regulating the re‑equilibration of Treg/Th17 and that the regulatory mechanism may be closely related to the IL‑23/Th17 pathway. The results of the present study provided molecular insight into the mechanism by which curcumin treats ulcerative colitis.

  Title: Effects of Vitamin D3 on Intestinal Flora in a Mouse Model of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Treated with Rifaximin.
  Abstract: BACKGROUND Rifaximin is an antimicrobial agent used to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Vitamin D3 can control IBD due to its effects on inflammatory cytokines. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of vitamin D3 on the intestinal flora of a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mouse model treated with rifaximin. MATERIAL AND METHODS The mouse model of IBD was developed using DSS (4%) administered via the drinking water. Twenty-four male C57BL6 mice were divided into the control group with a normal diet (N=6), the DSS group with a normal diet (N=6), the DSS group with a normal diet treated with rifaximin (N=6), and the DSS group with a normal diet treated with rifaximin and vitamin D3 (N=6). After 14 days, the colonic tissue was studied histologically. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to measure the level of IL-6 and P65, and phospho-p65 was measured by western blot. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to analyze fecal samples. RESULTS In the DSS mouse model of IBD, rifaximin reduced the inflammation severity of the colon and reduced the expression of phospho-p65, p65, TNF-alpha, and IL-6. In the DSS+rifaximin+vitamin D3 group, the therapeutic influences of rifaximin, in terms of weight loss and colonic disease activity, were significantly reduced, and the gut microbiota of the mice were completely changed in composition and diversity. CONCLUSIONS In a mouse model of IBD, treatment with vitamin D3 significantly increased the metabolism of rifaximin and reduced its therapeutic effects.

Twenty-four male C57BL6 mice were divided into the control group with a normal diet (N=6), the DSS group with a normal diet (N=6), the DSS group with a normal diet treated with rifaximin (N=6), and the DSS group with a normal diet treated with rifaximin and vitamin D3 (N=6). After 14 days, the colonic tissue was studied histologically. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to measure the level of IL-6 and P65, and phospho-p65 was measured by western blot. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to analyze fecal samples. RESULTS In the DSS mouse model of IBD, rifaximin reduced the inflammation severity of the colon and reduced the expression of phospho-p65, p65, TNF-alpha, and IL-6. In the DSS+rifaximin+vitamin D3 group, the therapeutic influences of rifaximin, in terms of weight loss and colonic disease activity, were significantly reduced, and the gut microbiota of the mice were completely changed in composition and diversity. CONCLUSIONS In a mouse model of IBD, treatment with vitamin D3 significantly increased the metabolism of rifaximin and reduced its therapeutic effects.

  Title: Impaired IFN-γ-dependent STAT3 Activation Is Associated With Dysregulation of Regulatory and Inflammatory Signaling in Monocytes of Ulcerative Colitis Patients.
  Abstract: The Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) inhibitor tofacitinib has been recently approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) but not Crohn's disease (CD). Systematic analysis of the JAK/STAT pathway in inflammatory bowel disease is still missing. The aim of this study was to investigate JAK/STAT activation and adjacent signaling in monocytes of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, which are key players in inflammatory responses.Blood samples of active UC (n = 28) and CD patients (n = 28) and healthy controls (n = 22) were collected for primary monocyte investigation. STAT phosphorylation (pSTAT), cytokine secretion, and surface marker expression ± prior tofacitinib blockade in addition to Th-17 and regulatory T cell induction in cocultures were analyzed upon interferon (IFN)-γ timulation.Baseline frequencies of pSTAT1+ and pSTAT3+ monocytes were significantly higher in UC, whereas IFN-γ-associated crosstalk induction of pSTAT3+ monocytes was missing in UC-derived monocytes compared with controls and CD. This coincided with decreased interleukin (IL)-10 and cluster of differentiation (CD)39 levels, diminished regulatory T cell (Treg) induction, and increased IL-12 and IL-23 secretion compared with controls, which was not observed in CD monocytes. Tofacitinib induced stronger inhibition of inflammatory cytokine release (IL-6, TNFα, IL-12, IL-23) in UC compared with CD monocytes.In UC monocytes, IFN-γ-associated activation of the JAK/STAT pathway is impaired with an imbalance between STAT1 and STAT3, coinciding with stronger induction of inflammatory monocytes by IFN-γ compared with controls or CD. The fact that tofacitinib had stronger regulatory impact on UC than on CD monocytes further underlines a stronger inflammatory involvement of the JAK/STAT pathway in UC pathogenesis, which might result from missing STAT3 activation to counteract STAT1-induced inflammation.© 2020 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

  Title: Aqueous Leaf Extract of Pistacia lentiscus Improves Acute Acetic Acid-Induced Colitis in Rats by Reducing Inflammation and Oxidative Stress.
  Abstract: We investigate the antioxidant activity and protective effects of the aqueous leaf extract of Pistacia lentiscus (AELPL) against ulcerative colitis induced by acetic acid infusion through the rectum in Wistar rats. Phytochemical analyses allowed the identification of numerous phenolic compounds in P. lentiscus leaves such as flavonoids (isoquercetin and luterolin), flavonols (catechin, rutin, and kaempferol), phenolic acids (ellagic and dicaffeoylquinic), and tanins. Acetic acid exposure induced macroscopic colonic mucosal lesions with hemorrhage, congestion, edema, and the development of an expected oxidative stress state revealed by an increase in lipoperoxidation and carbonylation of proteins and a decrease in sulfhydryl (SH) group levels and antioxidant enzyme activities such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione-S-peroxidase, and glutathione transferase, as well as an increase in the inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-6, in the colon and plasma. Administration of acetic acid also increased plasma and tissue levels of hydrogen peroxide and rates of iron and free calcium, whereas AELPL significantly and dose-dependently attenuated all the previous biochemical alterations and intracellular mediator perturbations. In conclusion, the AELPL exhibited a potent cytoprotective effect against acetic acid-induced colitis in rats, mainly through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.

  Title: The oxysterol receptor GPR183 in inflammatory bowel diseases.
  Abstract: Immune cell trafficking is an important mechanism for the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The oxysterol receptor GPR183 and its ligands, dihydroxylated oxysterols, can mediate positioning of immune cells including innate lymphoid cells. GPR183 has been mapped to an IBD risk locus, however another gene, Ubac2 is encoded on the reverse strand and associated with Behçet's disease, therefore the role of GPR183 as a genetic risk factor requires validation. GPR183 and production of its oxysterol ligands are up-regulated in human IBD and murine colitis. Gpr183 inactivation reduced severity of colitis in group 3 innate lymphoid cells-dependent colitis and in IL-10 colitis but not in dextran sodium sulphate colitis. Irrespectively, Gpr183 knockout strongly reduced accumulation of intestinal lymphoid tissue in health and all colitis models. In conclusion, genetic, translational and experimental studies implicate GPR183 in IBD pathogenesis and GPR183-dependent cell migration might be a therapeutic drug target for IBD.

  Title: Exclusive enteral nutrition mediates gut microbial and metabolic changes that are associated with remission in children with Crohn's disease.
  Abstract: A nutritional intervention, exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) can induce remission in patients with pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). We characterized changes in the fecal microbiota and metabolome to identify the mechanism of EEN. Feces of 43 children were collected prior, during and after EEN. Microbiota and metabolites were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and NMR. Selected metabolites were evaluated in relevant model systems. Microbiota and metabolome of patients with CD and controls were different at all time points. Amino acids, primary bile salts, trimethylamine and cadaverine were elevated in patients with CD. Microbiota and metabolome differed between responders and non-responders prior to EEN. EEN decreased microbiota diversity and reduced amino acids, trimethylamine and cadaverine towards control levels. Patients with CD had reduced microbial metabolism of bile acids that partially normalized during EEN. Trimethylamine and cadaverine inhibited intestinal cell growth. TMA and cadaverine inhibited LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha and IL-6 secretion by primary human monocytes. A diet rich in free amino acids worsened inflammation in the DSS model of intestinal inflammation. Trimethylamine, cadaverine, bile salts and amino acids could play a role in the mechanism by which EEN induces remission. Prior to EEN, microbiota and metabolome are different between responders and non-responders.

  Title: Anti-inflammatory Activity of Mollugin on DSS-induced Colitis in Mice.
  Abstract: We aimed to explore the anti-inflammatory activity of mollugin extracted from Rubia cordifolia L, a traditional Chinese medicine, on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice. Thirty C57BL/6 mice were divided into a control group (n=6), a model group (n=6), and three experimental groups (40, 20, 10 mg/kg of mollugin, n=6 each). DSS solution (3%) was given to mice in the model group and experimental groups from day 4 to day 10 to induce the mouse UC model. Mice in the experimental groups were intragastrically administrated mollugin from day 1 to day 10. Animals were orally given distilled water in the control group for the whole experiment time and in the model group from day 1 to day 3. The changes in colon pathology were detected by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in the serum, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interferon-γ (IFN) in the tissues were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Expression levels of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and myeloid differentiation factor 88 in the colon tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry. Results showed that mollugin could significantly reduce weight loss and the disease activity index in the DSS-induced UC mouse model. HE examinations demonstrated that mollugin treatment effectively improved the histological damage (P<0.05). The overproduction of IL-1β and TNF-α was remarkably inhibited by mollugin treatment at doses of 20 and 40 mg/kg (P<0.05). Additionally, the levels of TLR4 in colon tissues were significantly reduced in mollugin-treated groups compared with the DSS group. Our findings demonstrated that mollugin ameliorates DSS-induced UC by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory chemocytokines.

  Title: Clinical efficacy of infliximab level and anti-infliximab antibody measurement in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: An audit.
  Abstract: Infliximab (IFX) monitoring has been proposed for effective therapeutic management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There is no data on infliximab levels and its antibody measurement in Indian patients. We assessed the clinical efficacy of IFX level and antibodies to infliximab (ATI) monitoring in IBD patients.Infliximab trough level and antibody testing was done in 50 and 30 IBD patients, respectively using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. The levels were correlated with the disease status, albumin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. The clinical efficacy of level-based change in patient management was evaluated.Of 50 patients, IFX levels were therapeutic in 8, sub-therapeutic in 40, and supra-therapeutic in 2. High ATI titer was present in 8/30 patients. The IFX level did not correlate with the dose of 5 or 10 mg/kg. Based on IFX level and ATI estimation, management was changed in 35 patients: increase in dose in 7, decrease in dosing interval in 17, increase in interval in 2, surgery in 2, change in biologic in 5, and cessation of IFX in 2 patients. Therapy modification based on IFX level improved the clinical response in 25 patients, of whom 5 are in remission at a median duration of 2 years.Most (80%) of the IBD patients had subtherapeutic IFX levels while high ATI titers were found in 27% of the patients. There was no correlation between infliximab dose and drug levels. Therapy modification based on drug level benefitted the majority. Our results suggest that measurement of IFX level assists in attaining therapeutic levels and improves clinical response.

  Title: Clinical efficacy of infliximab level and anti-infliximab antibody measurement in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: An audit.
  Abstract: Infliximab (IFX) monitoring has been proposed for effective therapeutic management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There is no data on infliximab levels and its antibody measurement in Indian patients. We assessed the clinical efficacy of IFX level and antibodies to infliximab (ATI) monitoring in IBD patients.Infliximab trough level and antibody testing was done in 50 and 30 IBD patients, respectively using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. The levels were correlated with the disease status, albumin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. The clinical efficacy of level-based change in patient management was evaluated.Of 50 patients, IFX levels were therapeutic in 8, sub-therapeutic in 40, and supra-therapeutic in 2. High ATI titer was present in 8/30 patients. The IFX level did not correlate with the dose of 5 or 10 mg/kg. Based on IFX level and ATI estimation, management was changed in 35 patients: increase in dose in 7, decrease in dosing interval in 17, increase in interval in 2, surgery in 2, change in biologic in 5, and cessation of IFX in 2 patients. Therapy modification based on IFX level improved the clinical response in 25 patients, of whom 5 are in remission at a median duration of 2 years.Most (80%) of the IBD patients had subtherapeutic IFX levels while high ATI titers were found in 27% of the patients. There was no correlation between infliximab dose and drug levels. Therapy modification based on drug level benefitted the majority. Our results suggest that measurement of IFX level assists in attaining therapeutic levels and improves clinical response.

  Title: Feiyangchangweiyan capsule protects against ulcerative colitis in mice by modulating the OSM/OSMR pathway and improving gut microbiota.
  Abstract: Feiyangchangweiyan capsule (FYC) is a traditional Chinese medicine formulation used in the clinical treatment of acute and chronic gastroenteritis and bacterial dysentery. However, the effect of FYC on ulcerative colitis (UC) and the mechanism thereof remains unknown.To investigate the protective effect of FYC on UC mice induced by dextran sulfate sodium and illustrate the potential mechanism of this effect.Here, we established a model of UC mice by dextran sulfate sodium and administered with FYC. The disease activity index (DAI), colon length, myeloperoxidase (MPO) content in serum, pathological structure and ultrastructural changes, and inflammatory cell infiltration of colon tissue were evaluated. Transcriptome and 16S rDNA sequencing were employed to illuminate the mechanism of FYC in the protection of UC mice.FYC significantly alleviates the pathological damage and the infiltration of inflammatory cells in colon tissue of dextran sulfate sodium induced UC mice, rescues shortened colon length, reduces DAI score, MPO content in serum, and pro-inflammatory factors including IL-1β, IL-6, CCL11, MCP-1 and MIP-2, and increases anti-inflammatory factors such as IL-10. Transcriptomics revealed that Oncostatin M (OSM) and its receptor (OSMR) are the critical pathway for UC treatment by FYC. OSM and OSMR increased in UC mice compared to control mice, and decreased with FYC, which was verified via measurement of OSM and OSMR mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, we observed that FYC modulates intestinal microbiome composition (e.g., the proportion of Barnesiella/Proteobacteria) by affecting the inflammatory factors.FYC exerts an effect on UC by inhibiting the OSM/OSMR pathway and regulating inflammatory factors to improve the intestinal flora.Copyright © 2020.

  Title: NUDT15 C415T variant compared with TPMT genotyping in predicting azathioprine-induced leucopenia: prospective analysis of 1014 inflammatory bowel disease patients in India.
  Abstract: Recent studies reported that Nudix Hydrolase 15(NUDT 15) gene variant (C415T) can better predict thiopurine induced leucopenia in Asian patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) than thiopurine S-methyl transferase (TPMT).To evaluate the role of the NUDT variant compared with TPMT in predicting azathioprine induced leucopenia in Indian IBD patients.Prospectively collected data of consecutive patients treated with azathioprine from a large IBD registry were analysed for side effects, discontinuation time, and initial and maximum dose tolerated. Genotyping of NUDT15 C415T (rs116855232; p.R139C) was carried out retrieving blood samples from bio-repository employing real time polymerase chain reaction with age and sex-matched healthy volunteers. The association of NUDT15 C415T with leucopenia (<3 × 109 /L) and neutropenia (<1.5 × 109 /L) was evaluated. TPMT genotyping was done in patients who developed leucopenia.Among 1014 patients (mean age 35.84 ± 12.74 years; 61% males; 54% ulcerative colitis, 44% Crohn's disease and 2% IBD-unclassified), 79 were excluded due to inadequate blood samples. Of the remaining 935, 81 (9%) developed leucopenia and 70 (7.5%) developed neutropenia. The variant "T" allele [heterozygous (CT) and homozygous (TT) versus wild type (CC)] was associated with a 19-fold higher odds (OR19.35, 95% CI11.55-32.42; P < 0.0001) of leucopenia and 21-fold higher odds of neutropenia (OR21.41, 95% CI12.25-37.41). There was significant difference in median dose tolerated between CC, CT and TT (1.35, 1.38 and 0.92 mg/kg body weight, respectively) (P = 0.037) and median duration of therapy (18, 15 and 10 months for CC/CT/TT) (P = 0.003). NUDT15 genotype was an independent risk factor for leucopenia (hazard ratio (HR): CT 11.31, 95% CI6.85-18.03, P < 0.0001 and TT 31.283, 95% CI14.76-66.30 compared to CC) and neutropenia (HR: CT 13.04, 95% CI7.65-22.22, P < 0.0001 and TT 43.39, 95% CI20.21-92.68 compared to CC). The sensitivities for predicting leucopenia and neutropenia by number of mutant NUDT 15 alleles based on additive predictive model were 66.67% and 70% with a receptor operator characteristic curve area under curve value of 0.791 and 0.807, respectively. Among patients with leucopenia, only 6.2% were heterozygous and none were homozygous for TPMT variants.NUDT15 variant genotyping appears to be a better predictor for azathioprine-induced leucopenia in an Indian population than TPMT with high accuracy and can be useful in optimizing azathioprine dosage.© 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

  Title: Rapid weight gain in infliximab treated Crohn's disease patients is sustained over time: real-life data over 12 months.
  Abstract: Infliximab (IFX) is used in active Crohn's disease for induction and maintenance of remission. There are scanty data on weight gain in IBD-patients under anti-TNF treatment. We investigated changes in weight and blood chemistry in anti-TNF-naïve Crohn's disease patients during their first course of IFX.Retrospective analysis of 110 patients (77 men, 33 women) aged 34 years (range 14-73), 54 with luminal and 56 with fistulising disease, given at least 3 infusions of IFX (range 3-11). Data regarding body weight, height, C-reactive protein (CRP), haemoglobin and S-albumin at baseline, before the third infusion, at three months and at 12 months were collected.At 6 weeks, 65 (59%) increased in weight, 73% and 76% at three and 12 months, respectively. There was an increase in median weight (1.7 kg, IQR = 3.1 kg) and BMI (0.5 kg/m2, IQR = 1.2 kg/m2) at 6 weeks, which persisted at three and 12 months (all p < .001). There was no difference between men and women. Young patients, patients with underweight or fistulising disease increased most in weight. Disease activity assessed by PGA and SES-CD decreased at all time points (p < .05). Increases in weight and BMI correlated with an increase in serum albumin and a decrease in CRP.Approximately 60% of Crohn's disease patients experience weight gain within the first six weeks of infliximab treatment. The weight increment correlates with improvements in inflammatory markers and disease activity. The causes of weight gain may be related to treatment induced metabolic changes and reduced inflammatory burden.

  Title: Serological Biomarkers of Tissue Turnover Identify Responders to Anti-TNF Therapy in Crohn's Disease: A Pilot Study.
  Abstract: Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy is effective in inducing remission in Crohn's disease in 60% of patients. No serological biomarkers are available, which can predict response to anti-TNF. We aimed to investigate serological markers of collagen turnover reflecting tissue inflammation as predictors of response to anti-TNF.In 2 retrospective observational cohorts, markers for matrix metalloproteinase-degraded type III and IV collagens (C3M and C4M, respectively) and for formation of type III and IV collagens (PRO-C3 and PRO-C4, respectively) were measured in serum and compared with standard C-reactive protein in patients with active Crohn's disease who started infliximab (IFX, n = 21) or adalimumab (ADA, n = 21). Disease activity was classified by the Harvey-Bradshaw index (active disease ≥5); response was defined as clinical remission.Seventeen patients (81%) treated with IFX were in remission at week 14; 15 patients (71%) treated with ADA were in remission at week 8. Serum C4M at baseline was increased in nonresponders compared with responders (IFX: 35.0 ± 2.4 vs 23.2 ± 2.6, P = 0.04, ADA: 53.0 ± 3.2 vs 34.1 ± 2.8, P = 0.006). C4M levels at baseline predicted response in both cohorts (IFX: odds ratio 39 [95% confidence interval, 2.4-523.9] P = 0.02, cutoff 35.2 nmol/L; ADA: odds ratio 26 [95% confidence interval, 1.8-332.5], P = 0.01, cutoff 46.9 nmol/L). C-reactive protein was not able to predict response to anti-TNF.Response to anti-TNF therapy within the first 14 weeks of treatment can be predicted based on baseline levels of basement membrane marker C4M. This marker could be used as biomarker for response to anti-TNF and could aid in early therapy decision making. Validation in larger well-defined cohorts is needed.

  Title: Association Between Vedolizumab Levels, Anti-vedolizumab Antibodies, and Endoscopic Healing Index in a Large Population of Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.
  Abstract: The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between serum vedolizumab (VDZ) concentrations and antibodies to VDZ (ATV) in a large cohort of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. Furthermore, we evaluated the association between serum VDZ concentrations and a novel serum-based biomarker panel designated as the endoscopic healing index (EHI), developed and validated for identifying mucosal inflammation in patients with Crohn's disease (CD).Retrospective study where results from patient samples submitted to a commercial clinical laboratory were included. Serum VDZ and ATV levels were analyzed using a drug-tolerant assay. In CD patients for whom both VDZ and EHI were available, VDZ concentrations were correlated with EHI. serum VDZ threshold analysis was performed using ROC curves, and the serum VDZ concentrations that best differentiated EHI < 20 (previously associated with endoscopic remission) were chosen.A total of 9356 patients were included in the VDZ/ATV analysis. Detectable ATV was observed in 2.9% patients with significantly lower serum VDZ concentrations when compared to those with undetectable ATV [3.9 µg/mL (0-9.0) vs. 11.3 µg/mL (5.9-20.6), p < 0.0001]. Of the patients with serum VDZ result, 287 patients had a concomitant EHI test. An inverse correlation was observed between VDZ concentration and EHI (rho = - 0.20, p < 0.001). A serum VDZ concentration ≥ 15.7 µg/ml was best correlated wi th an EHI < 20 [AUROC: 0.67 (95% CI 0.57-0.77)].Incidence of ATVs was low, but significantly associated with lower VDZ levels. A serum VDZ concentration threshold of ≥ 15.7 µg/ml was associated with endoscopic remission as defined by an EHI < 20.© 2020. The Author(s).

  Title: Association Between Vedolizumab Levels, Anti-vedolizumab Antibodies, and Endoscopic Healing Index in a Large Population of Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.
  Abstract: The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between serum vedolizumab (VDZ) concentrations and antibodies to VDZ (ATV) in a large cohort of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. Furthermore, we evaluated the association between serum VDZ concentrations and a novel serum-based biomarker panel designated as the endoscopic healing index (EHI), developed and validated for identifying mucosal inflammation in patients with Crohn's disease (CD).Retrospective study where results from patient samples submitted to a commercial clinical laboratory were included. Serum VDZ and ATV levels were analyzed using a drug-tolerant assay. In CD patients for whom both VDZ and EHI were available, VDZ concentrations were correlated with EHI. serum VDZ threshold analysis was performed using ROC curves, and the serum VDZ concentrations that best differentiated EHI < 20 (previously associated with endoscopic remission) were chosen.A total of 9356 patients were included in the VDZ/ATV analysis. Detectable ATV was observed in 2.9% patients with significantly lower serum VDZ concentrations when compared to those with undetectable ATV [3.9 µg/mL (0-9.0) vs. 11.3 µg/mL (5.9-20.6), p < 0.0001]. Of the patients with serum VDZ result, 287 patients had a concomitant EHI test. An inverse correlation was observed between VDZ concentration and EHI (rho = - 0.20, p < 0.001). A serum VDZ concentration ≥ 15.7 µg/ml was best correlated wi th an EHI < 20 [AUROC: 0.67 (95% CI 0.57-0.77)].Incidence of ATVs was low, but significantly associated with lower VDZ levels. A serum VDZ concentration threshold of ≥ 15.7 µg/ml was associated with endoscopic remission as defined by an EHI < 20.© 2020. The Author(s).

  Title: Spinal neuron-glia-immune interaction in cross-organ sensitization.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), historically considered as regional gastrointestinal disorders with heightened colonic sensitivity, are increasingly recognized to have concurrent dysfunction of other visceral and somatic organs, such as urinary bladder hyperactivity, leg pain, and skin hypersensitivity. The interorgan sensory cross talk is, at large, termed "cross-organ sensitization." These organs, anatomically distant from one another, physiologically interlock through projecting their sensory information into dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and then the spinal cord for integrative processing. The fundamental question of how sensitization of colonic afferent neurons conveys nociceptive information to activate primary afferents that innervate distant organs remains ambiguous. In DRG, primary afferent neurons are surrounded by satellite glial cells (SGCs) and macrophage accumulation in response to signals of injury to form a neuron-glia-macrophage triad. Astrocytes and microglia are major resident nonneuronal cells in the spinal cord to interact, physically and chemically, with sensory synapses. Cumulative evidence gathered so far indicate the indispensable roles of paracrine/autocrine interactions among neurons, glial cells, and immune cells in sensory cross-activation. Dichotomizing afferents, sensory convergency in the spinal cord, spinal nerve comingling, and extensive sprouting of central axons of primary afferents each has significant roles in the process of cross-organ sensitization; however, more results are required to explain their functional contributions. DRG that are located outside the blood-brain barrier and reside upstream in the cascade of sensory flow from one organ to the other in cross-organ sensitization could be safer therapeutic targets to produce less central adverse effects.

  Title: Infliximab clearance decreases in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy in inflammatory bowel disease.
  Abstract: Infliximab therapy during pregnancy in inflammatory bowel disease is challenged by a dilemma between maintaining adequate maternal disease control while minimizing fetal infliximab exposure. We investigated the effects of pregnancy on infliximab pharmacokinetics.The study population comprised 23 retrospectively identified pregnancies. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease were generally in clinical remission at pregnancy conception (74%) and received steady infliximab maintenance therapy (5 mg/kg q8w n = 17; q6w n = 4; q10w n = 1; 10 mg/kg q8w n = 1). Trough blood samples had been obtained in the same patients prior to pregnancy (n = 119), the first trimester (n = 16), second trimester (n = 18), third trimester (n = 7), and postpregnancy (n = 12). Data were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects population pharmacokinetic modeling.Dose-normalized infliximab concentrations were significantly higher during the second trimester (median 15 mg/ml/kg, interquartile range 10-21) compared to prepregnancy (7, 2-12; p = 0.003), the first trimester (9, 1-12; p = 0.04), or postpregnancy (6, interquartile range 3-11; p > 0.05) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Similar trends were observed in the third trimester (13, 7-36; p > 0.05). A one-compartment model with linear elimination described the pharmacokinetics of infliximab (volume of distribution n = 18.2 L; clearance 0.61 L/day). Maternal infliximab exposure was influenced by the second and third trimester of pregnancy and anti-infliximab antibodies, and not by pregnancy-imposed physiological changes in, for example, body weight or albumin. Infliximab clearance decreased significantly during the second and third trimesters by up to 15% as compared to pre- and postpregnancy and the first trimester. The increased maternal infliximab exposure was weakly associated with lowered clinical disease activity. Pharmacokinetic model simulations of virtual patients indicated the increased maternal infliximab trough concentrations imposed by pregnancy will not completely counteract the decrease in infliximab concentration if therapy is paused in the third trimester.Infliximab clearance decreases significantly in the second and third trimesters, leading to increasing maternal infliximab concentrations in any given regimen. Maternal infliximab levels may thus be maintained as constant in a de-intensified regimen by therapeutic drug monitoring guidance in inflammatory bowel disease.© 2020 The Authors.

  Title: Fibrinogen/AKT/Microfilament Axis Promotes Colitis by Enhancing Vascular Permeability.
  Abstract: Increased vascular permeability (VP) has been indicated to play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the pathological causes of increased intestinal VP in IBD remain largely unknown.Fibrinogen level was measured in dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and patients with ulcerative colitis. Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro acetate (GPRP), an Fg inhibitor, was used to detect the effect of Fg inhibition on the pathogenesis of DSS-induced colitis, as indicated by tissue damage, cytokine release and inflammatory cell infiltration. Miles assay was used to detect vascular permeability.Through tandem mass tag-based quantitative proteomics, fibrinogen (Fg) was found to be upregulated in the colon of DSS-treated mice, which was consistent with increased Fg level in colon sample of patients with ulcerative colitis. Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro acetate (GPRP), an Fg inhibitor, significantly alleviated DSS-induced colitis as indicated by improvement of body weight loss and mortality. GPRP decreased colonic inflammation and VP in DSS-treated mice. In vivo, Fg enhanced VP as indicated by Miles assay, which was significantly inhibited by GRPR, AKT (serine/threonine kinase 1) inhibitors and low doses of Jasplakinolide which induced actin polymerization, while was dramatically enhanced by Cytochalasin D (an actin polymerization inhibitor). Moreover, activation of AKT was found in vessels of DSS-treated mice. In vitro, Fg induced activation of AKT and depolymerization of microfilament and promoted cell-to-cell disaggregation. Furthermore, inhibition of AKT decreased Fg-induced microfilament depolymerization.Our findings highlight the importance of Fg in regulating colitis by modulation of VP via activating AKT and subsequent depolymerization of microfilament and suggest Fg as an attractive target for anti-colitis treatment.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

  Title: Genomic and drug target evaluation of 90 cardiovascular proteins in 30,931 individuals.
  Abstract: Circulating proteins are vital in human health and disease and are frequently used as biomarkers for clinical decision-making or as targets for pharmacological intervention. Here, we map and replicate protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) for 90 cardiovascular proteins in over 30,000 individuals, resulting in 451 pQTLs for 85 proteins. For each protein, we further perform pathway mapping to obtain trans-pQTL gene and regulatory designations. We substantiate these regulatory findings with orthogonal evidence for trans-pQTLs using mouse knockdown experiments (ABCA1 and TRIB1) and clinical trial results (chemokine receptors CCR2 and CCR5), with consistent regulation. Finally, we evaluate known drug targets, and suggest new target candidates or repositioning opportunities using Mendelian randomization. This identifies 11 proteins with causal evidence of involvement in human disease that have not previously been targeted, including EGF, IL-16, PAPPA, SPON1, F3, ADM, CASP-8, CHI3L1, CXCL16, GDF15 and MMP-12. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the utility of large-scale mapping of the genetics of the proteome and provide a resource for future precision studies of circulating proteins in human health.

  Title: Protective effects of citrulline supplementation in ulcerative colitis rats.
  Abstract: It has been reported that supplementing certain amino acids has therapeutic effects on ulcerative colitis (UC). We intend to explore whether citrulline (Cit) supplementation has protective effects on UC. Fifteen male Wistar rats were divided into normal control group (NC group), UC group and UC+Cit group, with five rats in each group. The UC model was established by TNBS/ethanol method. Rats in UC+Cit group were intragastrically administered with Cit for 7 consecutive days after modeling. All rats were sacrificed after 7 days. Blood samples were collected to detect the number of monocytes. Colon tissues were taken for HE staining. Immunohistochemistry staining for CD68 and p-STAT3 were performed to detect the infiltration of monocytes and the phosphorylation of STAT3 in colon tissues. The concentrations of MCP-1, IL-6 and IL-17A and the protein expression of p-STAT3 in colon tissues were measured by ELISA and western blot methods, respectively. The body weight of UC group rats decreased significantly after 7 days (p<0.05). However, the weight loss of UC+Cit group rats was not statistically significant (p>0.05). The number of peripheral blood monocytes in UC+Cit group was significantly lower than that in UC group (p<0.05), and the infiltration of CD68-positive monocytes in the colon tissue of UC+Cit group was significantly reduced than that in UC group. The concentrations of MCP-1, IL-6 and IL-17A and the expression of p-STAT3 in colon tissues of UC+Cit group rats were significantly lower than those in UC group (both p<0.05). Our study suggests that Cit supplementation may be a potential therapy for UC.

  Title: PTPN2 links colonic and joint inflammation in experimental autoimmune arthritis.
  Abstract: Loss-of-function variants of protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) enhance risk of inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis; however, whether the association between PTPN2 and autoimmune arthritis depends on gut inflammation is unknown. Here we demonstrate that induction of subclinical intestinal inflammation exacerbates development of autoimmune arthritis in SKG mice. Ptpn2-haploinsufficient SKG mice - modeling human carriers of disease-associated variants of PTPN2 - displayed enhanced colitis-induced arthritis and joint accumulation of Tregs expressing RAR-related orphan receptor γT (RORγt) - a gut-enriched Treg subset that can undergo conversion into FoxP3-IL-17+ arthritogenic exTregs. SKG colonic Tregs underwent higher conversion into arthritogenic exTregs when compared with peripheral Tregs, which was exacerbated by haploinsufficiency of Ptpn2. Ptpn2 haploinsufficiency led to selective joint accumulation of RORγt-expressing Tregs expressing the colonic marker G protein-coupled receptor 15 (GPR15) in arthritic mice and selectively enhanced conversion of GPR15+ Tregs into exTregs in vitro and in vivo. Inducible Treg-specific haploinsufficiency of Ptpn2 enhanced colitis-induced SKG arthritis and led to specific joint accumulation of GPR15+ exTregs. Our data validate the SKG model for studies at the interface between intestinal and joint inflammation and suggest that arthritogenic variants of PTPN2 amplify the link between gut inflammation and arthritis through conversion of colonic Tregs into exTregs.

  Title: PTPN2 links colonic and joint inflammation in experimental autoimmune arthritis.
  Abstract: Loss-of-function variants of protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) enhance risk of inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis; however, whether the association between PTPN2 and autoimmune arthritis depends on gut inflammation is unknown. Here we demonstrate that induction of subclinical intestinal inflammation exacerbates development of autoimmune arthritis in SKG mice. Ptpn2-haploinsufficient SKG mice - modeling human carriers of disease-associated variants of PTPN2 - displayed enhanced colitis-induced arthritis and joint accumulation of Tregs expressing RAR-related orphan receptor γT (RORγt) - a gut-enriched Treg subset that can undergo conversion into FoxP3-IL-17+ arthritogenic exTregs. SKG colonic Tregs underwent higher conversion into arthritogenic exTregs when compared with peripheral Tregs, which was exacerbated by haploinsufficiency of Ptpn2. Ptpn2 haploinsufficiency led to selective joint accumulation of RORγt-expressing Tregs expressing the colonic marker G protein-coupled receptor 15 (GPR15) in arthritic mice and selectively enhanced conversion of GPR15+ Tregs into exTregs in vitro and in vivo. Inducible Treg-specific haploinsufficiency of Ptpn2 enhanced colitis-induced SKG arthritis and led to specific joint accumulation of GPR15+ exTregs. Our data validate the SKG model for studies at the interface between intestinal and joint inflammation and suggest that arthritogenic variants of PTPN2 amplify the link between gut inflammation and arthritis through conversion of colonic Tregs into exTregs.

  Title: Chlorogenic Acid Improves Symptoms of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Interleukin-10 Knockout Mice.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic intestinal inflammation that is highly prevalent worldwide. Interleukin (IL)-10 can effectively inhibit negative cascades such as the production of inflammatory mediators (inducible nitric oxide synthase [iNOS], cyclooxygenase-2), accumulation of inflammatory infiltrates (macrophages, eosinophils, neutrophils), toxicity (lower T cell subsets), and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α) in tissues such as the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), Peyer's patch (PP), and colon. In this study, we investigated whether chlorogenic acid (CHA) can regulate inflammation in IL-10 knockout (KO) mice used as an IBD animal model. CHA significantly increased the ratio of CD4+/CD8+, T cell subsets in PP, and MLN of IL-10 KO mice. In addition, CHA also morphologically attenuated colon inflammation in IL-10 KO mice. We demonstrated that CHA significantly reduced the expression levels of iNOS, IL-1β, TNF-α, which were highly expressed in IL-10 KO mice. Therefore, CHA may provide beneficial effects for improving IBD by decreasing inflammations.

  Title: Infliximab concentrations in two non-switching cohorts of patients with inflammatory bowel disease: originator vs. biosimilar.
  Abstract: Biosimilars are replacing originator compounds due to their similar effectiveness, safety and pharmacokinetics. Our objective was to compare the differences in pharmacokinetics and clinical outcomes between the originator infliximab (Ifx) and the biosimilar CT-P13 in a patient cohort with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our cohort study included 86 patients from a historical and a prospective cohort from the start of infliximab treatment to 22 weeks later. Serum infliximab, antidrug antibody levels and other serum biomarkers were measured at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14 and 22. Remission outcomes were evaluated at weeks 14 and 22. Drug levels were measured prospectively and analysed using MANOVA. Of the 86 patients, 44 (51%) and 42 (49%) were administered the originator and CT-P13, respectively. Originator trough levels were higher than the biosimilar trough levels (35 vs. 21, 20.1 vs. 11, 6.6 vs. 2.9 and 4.3 vs. 1.7 μg/mL at weeks 2, 6, 14 and 22, respectively). A post-hoc analysis demonstrated changes in mean serum drug levels over time (p < 0.001) and according to the drug employed (p = 0.001). At week 22, 13 (81%) patients administered the originator achieved clinical remission compared with 5 (19%) patients with the biosimilar (p = 0.02). None of the patients administered the originator withdrew from the treatment compared with 7 for the biosimilar. During the study, there were significant differences in serum infliximab levels between the originator and the CT-P13 in the patients with IBD. The clinical outcomes were influenced by the type of compound administered.

  Title: Infliximab Therapy Could Decrease the Risk of the Development of Thyroid Disorders in Pediatric Patients With Crohn's Disease.
  Abstract: Autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITDs), may be associated with Crohn's disease (CD). Taking into consideration the role of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in the immune-mediated inflammation that underlies both diseases, we evaluated an ultrasound of thyroid gland in pediatric CD patients, naïve, and treated with infliximab (IFX), an anti-TNF-alpha antibody, to assess the risk for AITD and evaluated the usefulness of ultrasonography to diagnose AITD in patients with CD. Sixty-one patients with CD were enrolled in the study, including 36 patients (mean age 14.5 ± 3.5 years) treated with IFX (IFX group) for a mean of 13.9 ± 16.6 months and 25 patients (mean age 14.7 ± 2.3 years) who never received anti-TNF-alpha therapy (control group). An ultrasound examination of the thyroid gland was performed; thyroid function tests and thyroid antibodies were assessed. We found 10-times higher prevalence of decreased thyroid echogenicity in CD and IFX-naive patients compared to IFX-treated group [a significant reduction in thyroid echogenicity in 1/36 (2.8%) patients receiving IFX compared to 7/25 (28%) patients naive to biologic therapy]. The latter showed significantly lower thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels (p = 0.034) and higher levels of thyroid antibodies (p = 0.042) in comparison to control. Our data suggest the protective role of IFX therapy in the development of thyroid disorders and indicate the usefulness of thyroid ultrasound to identify the risk of probable AITD in pediatric patients with CD.Copyright © 2020 Furtak, Wedrychowicz, Sladek, Wedrychowicz, Fyderek and Starzyk.

  Title: Positive and negative side effects of androgen abuse. The HAARLEM study: A one-year prospective cohort study in 100 men.
  Abstract: An estimated 4-6% of fitness center visitors uses anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS). Reliable data about adverse reactions of AAS are scarce. The HAARLEM study aimed to provide insight into the positive and negative effects of AAS use. One hundred men (≥18 years) who intended to start an AAS cycle on short notice were included for follow-up. Clinic visits took place before (T0 ), at the end (T1 ), and three months after the end of the AAS cycle (T2 ), and one year after the start of the cycle (T3 ), and comprised a medical history, physical examination, laboratory analysis, and psychological questionnaires. During the follow-up period, four subjects reported a serious adverse event, that is, congestive heart failure, acute pancreatitis, suicidal ideation, and exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. All subjects reported positive side effects during AAS use, mainly increased strength (100%), and every subject reported at least one negative health effect. Most common were fluid retention (56%) and agitation (36%) during the cycle, and decreased libido (58%) after the cycle. Acne and gynecomastia were observed in 28% and 19%. Mean alanine transaminase (ALT) and creatinine increased 18.7 U/l and 4.7 µmol/L, respectively. AAS dose and cycle duration were not associated with the type and severity of side effects. After one-year follow-up (T3 ), the prevalence of observed effects had returned to baseline. There was no significant change in total scores of questionnaires investigating wellbeing, quality of life, and depression. In conclusion, all subjects experienced positive effects during AAS use. Four subjects experienced a serious adverse event. Other side effects were mostly anticipated, mild, and transient.© 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

  Title: Infliximab Trough Levels Are Not Predictive of Relapse in Patients with IBD in Endoscopic Remission: A Multicenter Cohort Study.
  Abstract: Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is important in optimizing use of biologics in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). However, the role of proactive TDM during remission remains uncertain.This retrospective study included patients receiving infliximab (IFX) therapy at Massachusetts General Hospital or Erasmus University Medical Center. All eligible patients had completed induction phase of IFX and were in clinical and endoscopic remission. Our primary outcome was clinical relapse within 2 years after baseline. Multivariable regression models examined the association between infliximab trough levels during remission and relapse, need for IBD-related surgery or hospitalization.Our study cohort included 110 patients with IBD (72 CD, 38 UC) on IFX maintenance therapy. In total, 12 patients (10.9%) experienced relapse of disease over 2 years. The mean IFX trough level at baseline was 8.0 µg/mL (± 8.6) and did not differ between the institutions. 49.1% of patients had levels < 5 µg/mL and 2.7% had antibodies to infliximab at baseline. There was no difference in the mean IFX trough levels between patients who relapsed (7.5 µg/mL ± 3.7 µg/mL) over 24 months compared to those who did not (8.1 µg/mL ± 7.9 µg/mL, p = 0.815). On multivariable logistic regression analysis, IFX trough levels at baseline were not associated with relapse of disease over 24 months (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93-1.09, p = 0.856).This retrospective multicenter study provides evidence that IFX trough levels during quiescent disease do not predict relapse over 2 years, suggestive that proactive TDM in this setting is not warranted.© 2020.

  Title: Deconvolution of monocyte responses in inflammatory bowel disease reveals an IL-1 cytokine network that regulates IL-23 in genetic and acquired IL-10 resistance.
  Abstract: Dysregulated immune responses are the cause of IBDs. Studies in mice and humans suggest a central role of interleukin (IL)-23-producing mononuclear phagocytes in disease pathogenesis. Mechanistic insights into the regulation of IL-23 are prerequisite for selective IL-23 targeting therapies as part of personalised medicine.We performed transcriptomic analysis to investigate IL-23 expression in human mononuclear phagocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We investigated the regulation of IL-23 expression and used single-cell RNA sequencing to derive a transcriptomic signature of hyperinflammatory monocytes. Using gene network correlation analysis, we deconvolved this signature into components associated with homeostasis and inflammation in patient biopsy samples.We characterised monocyte subsets of healthy individuals and patients with IBD that express IL-23. We identified autosensing and paracrine sensing of IL-1α/IL-1β and IL-10 as key cytokines that control IL-23-producing monocytes. Whereas Mendelian genetic defects in IL-10 receptor signalling induced IL-23 secretion after lipopolysaccharide stimulation, whole bacteria exposure induced IL-23 production in controls via acquired IL-10 signalling resistance. We found a transcriptional signature of IL-23-producing inflammatory monocytes that predicted both disease and resistance to antitumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapy and differentiated that from an IL-23-associated lymphocyte differentiation signature that was present in homeostasis and in disease.Our work identifies IL-10 and IL-1 as critical regulators of monocyte IL-23 production. We differentiate homeostatic IL-23 production from hyperinflammation-associated IL-23 production in patients with severe ulcerating active Crohn's disease and anti-TNF treatment non-responsiveness. Altogether, we identify subgroups of patients with IBD that might benefit from IL-23p19 and/or IL-1α/IL-1β-targeting therapies upstream of IL-23.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

  Title: A STAT3 palmitoylation cycle promotes TH17 differentiation and colitis.
  Abstract: Cysteine palmitoylation (S-palmitoylation) is a reversible post-translational modification that is installed by the DHHC family of palmitoyltransferases and is reversed by several acyl protein thioesterases1,2. Although thousands of human proteins are known to undergo S-palmitoylation, how this modification is regulated to modulate specific biological functions is poorly understood. Here we report that the key T helper 17 (TH17) cell differentiation stimulator, STAT33,4, is subject to reversible S-palmitoylation on cysteine 108. DHHC7 palmitoylates STAT3 and promotes its membrane recruitment and phosphorylation. Acyl protein thioesterase 2 (APT2, also known as LYPLA2) depalmitoylates phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) and enables it to translocate to the nucleus. This palmitoylation-depalmitoylation cycle enhances STAT3 activation and promotes TH17 cell differentiation; perturbation of either palmitoylation or depalmitoylation negatively affects TH17 cell differentiation. Overactivation of TH17 cells is associated with several inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In a mouse model, pharmacological inhibition of APT2 or knockout of Zdhhc7-which encodes DHHC7-relieves the symptoms of IBD. Our study reveals not only a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of IBD but also a model through which S-palmitoylation regulates cell signalling, which might be broadly applicable for understanding the signalling functions of numerous S-palmitoylation events.

  Title: Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor A3 is increased in IBD patients and functions as an anti-inflammatory modulator.
  Abstract: Growing evidence shows that a homozygous 6·7-kb deletion of the novel anti-inflammatory molecule leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor A3 (LILRA3) is associated with many autoimmune disorders. However, its effects on pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have yet not been clarified. LILRA3 is mainly expressed in monocytes, whereas its effects on biological behaviors of monocytes have not been systematically reported. In our study, to investigate the association between LILRA3 polymorphism and IBD susceptibility, LILRA3 polymorphism was assessed in 378 IBD patients and 509 healthy controls. Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were employed to detect the LILRA3 expression in IBD patient blood and intestinal samples. The human U937 monocyte cell line was employed to establish LILRA3 over-expressing cells and the effects of LILRA3 on the biological behaviors of U937 cells were systematically explored. Although no association of the polymorphism with IBD development was found, LILRA3 expression was markedly increased in IBD patients compared with healthy controls. Over-expression of LILRA3 in monocytes led to significant decreases in secretion of interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6. Additionally, LILRA3 abated monocyte migration by reducing the expression of several chemokines and enhanced monocyte phagocytosis by increasing CD36 expression. Furthermore, LILRA3 promoted monocyte proliferation through a combination of Akt and extracellular receptor kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (Erk/MEK) signaling pathways. We report for the first time, to our knowledge, that LILRA3 is related to IBD and functions as an anti-inflammatory modulator in U937 cells.© 2020 The Authors.

  Title: Tyrosine Kinase 2 Signalling Drives Pathogenic T cells in Colitis.
  Abstract: Tyrosine kinase 2 [TYK2] is required for the signalling of key cytokines in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. We assessed the efficacy of a novel selective TYK2 inhibitor [TYK2i] in experimental colitis, using pharmacological and genetic tools.At onset of T cell transfer colitis, RAG1-/- mice received vehicle or TYK2i daily by oral gavage. T cells lacking TYK2 kinase activity [TYK2KE] were used to confirm selectivity of the inhibitor. To this end, RAG1-/- or RAG1-/-TYK2KE animals were transferred with either wild type [WT] or TYK2KE-CD45RBhigh colitogenic T cells. Loss of body weight, endoscopic disease, the disease activity index [DAI], and histopathology scores were recorded. Tissues were analysed ex vivo for lymphocyte populations by flow cytometry. The impact of TYK2 inhibition on human DC-T cell interactions were studied using autologous Revaxis specific T cell assays.TYK2i [70 mg/kg] prevented weight loss and limited endoscopic activity during T cell transfer colitis. TYK2i [70 mg/kg] decreased DAI. Whereas transfer of WT T cells into RAG-/-TYK2KE hosts induced colitis, TYK2KE T cells transferred into RAG1-/-TYK2KErecipients failed to do so. Ex vivo analysis showed a decrease in colon tissue Th1 cells and an increase in Th17 cells upon transfer of TYK2KE-CD45RBhigh cells. In human antigen-triggered T cells, TYK2i displayed reduced Th1 differentiation, similar to murine Th1 cells.Oral administration of TYK2i, as well as transfer of T cells lacking TYK2 activity, reduced human Th1 differentiation and ameliorated the course of murine T cell transfer colitis. We conclude that TYK2 is a promising drug target for the treatment of IBD.© The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation.

  Title: New approach of medicinal herbs and sulfasalazine mixture on ulcerative colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate.
  Abstract: Sulfasalazine has been used as a standard-of-care in ulcerative colitis for decades, however, it results in severe adverse symptoms, such as hepatotoxicity, blood disorders, male infertility, and hypospermia. Accordingly, the new treatment strategy has to enhance pharmacological efficacy and stimultaneously minimize side effects.To compare the anti-inflammatory action of sulfasalazine alone or in combination with herbal medicine for ulcerative colitis in a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model.To induce ulcerative colitis, mice received 5% DSS in drinking water for 7 d. Animals were divided into five groups (n = 9 each) for use as normal (non-DSS), DSS controls, DSS + sulfasalazine (30 mg/kg)-treatment experimentals, DSS + sulfasalazine (60 mg/kg)-treatment experimentals, DSS + sulfasalazine (30 mg/kg) + Citrus unshiu peel and Bupleuri radix mixture (30 mg/kg) (SCPB)-treatment experimentals.The SCPB treatment showed an outstanding effectiveness in counteracting the ulcerative colitis, as evidenced by reduction in body weight, improvement in crypt morphology, increase in antioxidant defenses, down-regulation of proinflammatory proteins and cytokines, and inhibition of proteins related to apoptosis.SCPB may represent a promising alternative therapeutic against ulcerative colitis, without inducing adverse effects.©The Author(s) 2020.

  Title: Paracentral acute middle maculopathy (PAMM) associated with ulcerative colitis and coexisting hyperhomocysteinemia: A case report.
  Abstract: Paracentral acute middle maculopathy (PAMM) is a tomographic finding of a retinal occlusive vascular disorders with different aetiologies. Despite the well documented triple association among hyper-homocysteine, retinal vein occlusion and PAMM, up to date no reports exist on the development of PAMM in young patients affected by ulcerative colitis (UC).A multimodal imaging study, including fundus photographs, optical coherence tomography (OCT) B-scans, OCT angiography (OCT-A) and fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography, was performed in a 32-years-old male complaining of acute-onset paracentral scotoma in the right eye. Fundus images demonstrated the typical dark gray area of retinal capillary ischemia, corresponding on OCT B-scans to the hyper-reflective plaques in the INL, and consistent with PAMM lesions.The deep capillary plexus (DCP) was normal on OCT-A. Fluorescein angiography revealed a concurrent branch retinal vein preocclusion and showed capillary drop out parafoveally. Patient's anamnesis was negative except for a 15-years history of UC and use of acetylsalicylic acid (ASS). At the time of presentation, UC was quiescent, but new blood tests revealed concomitant high values of homocysteinemia requiring oral vitamin B12 and folate supplementation. Two months later PAMM lesions had disappeared on OCT B-scans and a retinal thinning at the level of the inner nuclear layer (INL) was visible. The DCP on OCT-A remained unchanged without any sign of capillary ischemia.Although no definitive evidence directly links UC with PAMM, the latter should be suspected in young patients affected by IBD with coexisting hyper-homocysteinemia and unexplained visual symptoms.

  Title: Participation of the intestinal microbiota in the mechanism of beneficial effect of treatment with synbiotic Syngut on experimental colitis under stress conditions.
  Abstract: Gut-brain axis plays a central role in the regulation of stress related diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is increasingly recognized that stress modulates gut microbiota community structure and activity and represents an important causal factor in dysbiosis. This study was designed to determine the effect of daily treatment with synbiotic (Syngut) containing inulin, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis W51, Lactobacillus plantarum W21 and Lactococcus lactis applied i.g. at a dose of 50 mg/kg i.g. on the colonic damage and colonic mucosal blood flow in rats with experimentally induced TNBS-colitis that were additionally exposed or not to acute stress (episodes of cold restraint stress every other day before colitis induction). Control rats received daily treatment with vehicle (saline, i.g.) or mesalazine (50 mg/kg-d i.g.), the standard drug recommended in therapy of IBD. At the termination of TNBS colitis, the histologic evaluation of colonic mucosa, mucosal malonyldialdehyde (MDA) level and plasma concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β) and adipokine adiponectin were assessed. the samples of colonic mucosa not involving colonic lesions and surrounding the flared mucosa were excised for the determination of mRNA expression for proinflammatory biomarkers TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-10 and COX-2 as well as antioxidazing factors SOD-1 and SOD-2. Finally, the gut microbial profiles were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing at phylum, family and genus level. Episodes of cold stress significantly aggravated the course of TNBS colitis, and significantly increased the release of proinflammatory cytokines as well as the significant increase in the MDA concentration has been observed as compared with non-stressed TNBS rats. These changes were followed by the significant fall in the CBF and plasma adiponectin levels and by the overexpression of mRNA of proinflammatory biomarkers. Synbiotic treatment with Syngut significantly reduced the area of colonic lesions observed macroscopically and microscopically in rats with TNBS colitis with or without exposure to cold stress, significantly increased the CBF, normalized plasma adiponectin levels and significantly attenuated the release and colonic expression of proinflammatory cytokines and biomarkers. the analysis of the gut microbiota showed a significant reduction of microbial diversity (Shannon index) in rats with TNBS colitis with or without exposure to stress.

  Title: Biological Therapy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients Partly Restores Intestinal Innate Lymphoid Cell Subtype Equilibrium.
  Abstract: Patients with Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) suffer from chronic relapsing intestinal inflammation. While many studies focused on adaptive immunity, less is known about the role of innate immune cells in these diseases. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are recently identified cells with a high cytokine-producing capacity at mucosal barriers. The aim was to study the impact of biological treatment on ILC in CD and UC. Patients initiating anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF), ustekinumab, or vedolizumab treatment were prospectively followed up and peripheral and intestinal ILCs were determined. In the inflamed gut tissue of patients with inflammatory bowel disease, we found an increase of ILC1 and in immature NKp44- ILC3, whereas there was a decrease of mature NKp44+ ILC3 when compared to healthy controls (HCs). Similar but less pronounced changes in ILC1 were observed in blood, whereas circulating NKp44- ILC3 were decreased. Fifteen percent of CD patients had NKp44+ ILC3 in blood and these cells were not detected in blood of HCs or UC patients. Therapy with three different biologicals (ustekinumab targeting the IL-12/23 cytokines, anti-TNF and vedolizumab) partly restored intestinal ILC subset equilibrium with a decrease of ILC1 (except for ustekinumab) and an increase of NKp44+ ILC3. Anti-TNF also mobilized more NKp44+ ILC3 in circulation. As ILC1 are proinflammatory cells and as NKp44+ ILC3 contribute to homeostasis of intestinal mucosa, the observed effects of biologicals on ILCs might contribute to their clinical efficacy.Copyright © 2020 Creyns, Jacobs, Verstockt, Cremer, Ballet, Vandecasteele, Vanuytsel, Ferrante, Vermeire, Van Assche, Ceuppens and Breynaert.

  Title: Synergistic Effect of Berberine-Based Chinese Medicine Assembled Nanostructures on Diarrhea-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome In Vivo.
  Abstract: Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is one common chronic functional disease of the digestive system with limited treatments. The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) has a central function in the pathogeny of IBS-D, which includes the participation of many various factors, such as brain-gut peptides (BGPs), immune inflammation, and intestinal flora. Inspired by the drug combination in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), our previous study discovered that berberine (BBR) and baicalin (BA) could form natural self-assemblies as BA-BBR nanoparticles (BA-BBR NPs) and showed synergistic effects against IBS-D. Here, we investigated the synergistic effects of BA-BBR NPs on IBS-D model mice induced by chronic restraint stress plus Senna alexandrina Mill decoction with the influence on MGBA. BA-BBR NPs showed the best therapeutic effect on improving visceral hypersensitivity and diarrhea on IBS-D model mice, compared with BBR, BA, and BA/BBR mixture. Furthermore, BA-BBR NPs significantly (P<0.05) reduced the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and choline acety transferase (CHAT) in colon tissues or of serum from BGPs; it lowered the expressions of the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) in colon tissues and changed the levels of basophil granulocyte (BASO) and leukomonocyte (LYMPH) in whole blood from immune inflammation; it altered the intestinal flora of Bacteroidia, Deferribacteres, Verrucomicrobia, Candidatus_Saccharibacteria, and Cyanobacteria from intestinal flora. In conclusion, BA-BBR NPs, after forming the natural self-assembly between BBR and BA, promoted the synergistic effect on IBS-D mice than the sum of BBR and BA effects, based to the formation of self-assemblies rather than the simple mixing. It further proved that synergistic effect of BA-BBR NPs on IBS-D mice might be related to BGPs, immune inflammation, and intestinal flora from three important interrelated components of MGBA. This study will provide a novel idea for the interpretation of TCM compatibility theory and provide the basis for BA-BBR NPs as a medicinal plant-derived natural and efficient nanomaterial for clinical use.Copyright © 2020 Li, Cui, Li, Qi, Chen, Gao, Tian, Mu, He, Lv, Chu, Xu, Wang, Lei, Xu and Wang.

  Title: Adipokine Resistin Levels at Time of Pediatric Crohn Disease Diagnosis Predict Escalation to Biologic Therapy.
  Abstract: Hypertrophy of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a hallmark of Crohn disease (CD). The VAT produces a wide range of adipokines, biologically active factors that contribute to metabolic disorders in addition to CD pathogenesis. The study aim was to concomitantly evaluate serum adipokine profiles and VAT volumes as predictors of disease outcomes and treatment course in newly diagnosed pediatric patients with CD.Pediatric patients ages 6 to 20 years were enrolled, and their clinical data and anthropometric measurements were obtained. Adipokine levels were measured at 0, 6, and 12 months after CD diagnosis and baseline in control patients (CP). The VAT volumes were measured by magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography imaging within 3 months of diagnosis.One hundred four patients undergoing colonoscopy were prospectively enrolled: 36 diagnosed with CD and 68 CP. The serum adipokine resistin and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 levels were significantly higher in patients with CD at diagnosis than in CP. The VAT volume was similar between CD and CP. Baseline resistin levels at the time of diagnosis in patients with CD who were escalated to biologics was significantly higher than in those not treated using biologic therapy by 12 months (29.8 ng/mL vs 13.8 ng/mL; P = 0.004). A resistin level of ≥29.8 ng/mL at the time of diagnosis predicted escalation to biologic therapy in the first year after diagnosis with a specificity of 95% (sensitivity = 53%; area under the curve = 0.82; P = 0.015 for model with log-scale). There was a significantly greater reduction in resistin (P = 0.002) and PAI-1 (P = 0.010) at the 12-month follow-up in patients on biologics compared with patients who were not treated using biologics.Serum resistin levels at diagnosis of pediatric CD predict the escalation to biologic therapy at 12 months, independent of VAT volumes. Resistin and PAI-1 levels significantly improved in patients with CD after treatment using biologics compared with those not on biologics. These results suggest the utility of resistin as a predictive biomarker in pediatric CD.© 2020 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

  Title: Identifying Hub Genes, Key Pathways and Immune Cell Infiltration Characteristics in Pediatric and Adult Ulcerative Colitis by Integrated Bioinformatic Analysis.
  Abstract: In the present study, we investigated the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), pathways and immune cell infiltration characteristics of pediatric and adult ulcerative colitis (UC).We conducted DEG analysis using the microarray dataset GSE87473 containing 19 pediatric and 87 adult UC samples downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses were conducted using Metascape. We constructed the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and the drug-target interaction network of DEGs and identified hub modules and genes using Cytoscape and analyzed immune cell infiltration in pediatric and adult UC using CIBERSORT.In total, 1700 DEGs were screened from the dataset. These genes were enriched mainly in inter-cellular items relating to cell junctions, cell adhesion, actin cytoskeleton and transmembrane receptor signaling pathways and intra-cellular items relating to the splicing, metabolism and localization of RNA. CDC42, POLR2A, RAC1, PIK3R1, MAPK1 and SRC were identified as hub DEGs. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed higher proportions of naive B cells, resting memory T helper cells, regulatory T cells, monocytes, M0 macrophages and activated mast cells in pediatric UC, along with lower proportions of memory B cells, follicular helper T cells, γδ T cells, M2 macrophages, and activated dendritic cells.Our study suggested that hub genes CDC42, POLR2A, RAC1, PIK3R1, MAPK1 and SRC and immune cells including B cells, T cells, monocytes, macrophages and mast cells play vital roles in the pathological differences between pediatric and adult UC and may serve as potential biomarkers in the diagnosis and treatment of UC.© 2020.

  Title: Qingchang Huashi granule ameliorates experimental colitis via restoring the dendritic cell-mediated Th17/Treg balance.
  Abstract: The balance between T helper 17 (Th17) cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) is involved in immunological tolerance. Destruction of immunological tolerance by dendritic cell (DC)-mediated T cells is involved in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC). Qingchang Huashi granule (QCHS) has been confirmed in the treatment of UC involved by inhibiting the activation of DCs. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism through which QCHS restores the Th17/Treg balance by modulating DCs in the treatment of UC.The effects of QCHS on Th17 cells, Tregs and DCs were detected in a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced experimental colitis model. Furthermore, we injected QCHS-treated DCs into colitis model to test whether QCHS modulates the Th17/Treg balance via DCs. Tregs and Th17 cells were analyzed by FACS. IL-10, IL-17, and Foxp3 were measured by ELISA, Western blot and qRT-PCR.Both QCHS and QCHS-treated DCs improved colonic histopathology, diminished Th17 cell differentiation and inhibited IL-17 production while promoting CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg differentiation and augmenting IL-10 and Foxp3 expression in colitis mice. Additionally, QCHS reduced CD86 and MHC-II expression on DCs, decreased IL-12 production ex vivo and restored the Th17/Treg ratio in the colitis model.The findings of this study indicate that QCHS ameliorates TNBS-induced colitis by restoring the DC-mediated Th17/Treg balance.

  Title: Pterostilbene reduces colonic inflammation by suppressing dendritic cell activation and promoting regulatory T cell development.
  Abstract: Dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells play important roles in immune regulation, and modulating their function is an approach for developing preventive or therapeutic strategies against immune disorders. Herein, the effect of pterostilbene (PSB) (3',5'-dimethoxy-resveratrol)-a resveratrol-related polyphenol found in blueberries-on immune regulation was evaluated. Using an in vitro co-culture system, PSB was found to exert the strongest inhibitory effect among all tested resveratrol derivatives on DC-mediated T cell proliferation; moreover, PSB treatment decreased the Th1 and Th17 populations and increased the regulatory T cell (Treg) population. Upon co-stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, PSB inhibited CD4+ T cell proliferation and differentiation into Th1 cells. Additionally, PSB acted on DCs to suppress the lipopolysaccharide-induced transactivation of genes encoding antigen presentation-related molecules and inflammatory cytokines by attenuating the DNA-binding ability of the transcription factor PU.1. Furthermore, PSB promoted DC-mediated Foxp3+ Treg differentiation, and PU.1 knockdown increased DC-induced Treg activity. Oral administration of PSB alleviated the symptoms of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis and decreased tumor necrosis factor-α expression in mice. Thus, PSB treatment ameliorates colonic inflammation.© 2020 The Authors. The FASEB Journal published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.

  Title: Ewing's Sarcoma in a Patient with Crohn's Disease Treated with Ustekinumab: A Case Report.
  Abstract: Biologic therapies have revolutionized the treatment of immune-mediated diseases. They are generally well tolerated; however, there are reports of malignancies associated with the use of these drugs. This case is of an adolescent with refractory Crohn's disease treated with ustekinumab, who subsequently developed Ewing's sarcoma. Patients treated with ustekinumab have reportedly developed B cell lymphoma, epithelioid sarcoma, as well as cancer of the lung, esophagus, ovary, testis, kidney, and thyroid. However, this is the first documented case of a patient treated with ustekinumab to develop Ewing sarcoma.

  Title: [Paeoniflorin attenuates dextran sulfate sodium-induced ulcerative colitis in mice by inhibiting TLR5 expression and T cell activation].
  Abstract: Objective To investigate the therapeutic effect and mechanism of paeoniflorin on dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) mice. Methods C57BL/6 male mice were randomly divided into control group, model group, 600 mg/(kg.d) mesalazine treatment group, (12.5, 25, 50) mg/(kg.d) paeoniflorin treatment group, with 10 mice in each. All mice were treated with 30 g/L DSS for 5 days except the control group. Meanwhile, the mice in the other groups were orally administrated corresponding drugs for 10 days, while the mice in the control and model groups were given equivalent volumes of distilled water. Body mass, fecal characteristics and hematochezia of the mice were observed and recorded daily, and then disease activity index (DAI) was evaluated and calculated. Pathological changes in the colon were observed by HE staining. The levels of anti-flagellin antibody, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in the serum were measured by ELISA. The expression levels of Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and nuclear factor kappa-Bp65 (NF-κBp65) in the colon tissues were evaluated by Western blot analysis and the activation of lymphocytes in mesenteric lymph node (MLN) was detected by flow cytometry. Results Compared with the control group, DAI scores in the model group were significantly raised, the colon length was significantly shortened, and the epithelium and intestinal gland disappeared. In addition, the serum levels of anti-flagellin antibody, IL-6, TNF-α and the protein levels of TLR5, MyD88, NF-κBp65 in the colon significantly increased, and the activation of T lymphocytes in MLN went up in the model group. All symptoms above were alleviated in the mesalazine and paeoniflorin groups compared with the model group. Conclusion Paeoniflorin can attenuate UC in mice by inhibiting the expression of flagellin and TLR5, and the activation of T cells.

  Title: Imipramine improves visceral sensation and gut barrier in rat models of irritable bowel syndrome.
  Abstract: An impaired gut barrier, possibly leading to visceral hypersensitivity has been recently recognized to be one of the pivotal pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We previously showed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS), corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), and repeated water avoidance stress (WAS) induce visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability via pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling (rat IBS models). Although the precise mechanisms of action are unclear, imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, improves IBS symptoms, and also has anticytokine properties. In this study, we hypothesized that imipramine improves the gut barrier to ameliorate IBS symptoms. To test this hypothesis, we determined its effects on visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability in rat IBS models. The visceral pain threshold in response to colonic balloon distention was electrophysiologically estimated by abdominal muscle contractions, and colonic permeability was measured by quantifying the absorbed Evans blue in colonic tissue in vivo. Subcutaneous imipramine injection (7, 20, 50 mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced (1 mg/kg, subcutaneously) visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability. Imipramine also blocked these gastrointestinal (GI) changes induced by CRF (50 μg/kg, intraperitoneally) or repeated WAS (1 h daily for 3 days). Yohimbine (an α2-adrenoceptors antagonist), sulpiride (a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist), and naloxone hydrochloride (an opioid receptor antagonist) reversed these effects of imipramine in the LPS model. Therefore, imipramine may block GI changes in IBS via α2-adrenoceptors, dopamine D2, and opioid signaling. The improvement in the gut barrier resulting in inhibition of visceral pain is considered a valid mechanism of imipramine to ameliorate IBS symptoms.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

  Title: Achieving Target Infliximab Drug Concentrations Improves Blood and Fecal Neutrophil Biomarkers in Crohn's Disease.
  Abstract: The neutrophil fecal biomarkers, calprotectin (FCP) and lactoferrin (LCT), and peripheral blood neutrophil CD64 surface receptor (nCD64) are biomarkers for mucosal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although FCP has been evaluated as a biomarker for mucosal healing, cut points for LCT and nCD64 are less known. We aimed to identify the cut points for LCT and nCD64 that were associated with FCP remission, with a secondary aim to evaluate the relationship between biochemical outcomes and infliximab (IFX) trough concentrations.We analyzed FCP, LCT, and nCD64 before and after IFX induction in a pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) cohort study. Week-14 FCP biomarker remission was defined as FCP <250 µg/g, with clinical response defined as a weighted Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index <12.5 or Δ>17.5 improvement. Predictive outcomes were calculated by receiver operating characteristics (ROCs).Among 56 CD patients, ROC analysis identified an infusion 4 LCT <8.06 (area under the receiver operator characteristics [AUROC], 0.934, P < 0.001) and nCD64 <6.12 (AUROC, 0.76, P = 0.02) as the ideal cut points for week-14 FCP biomarker remission. End of induction IFX-trough of >9.4 µg/mL (AUROC, 0.799, P = 0.002) and >11.5 µg/mL (AUROC, 0.835, P = 0.003) were associated with a FCP <250 and FCP <100, respectively. We found patients achieving end of induction trough >5 µg/mL had a median FCP improvement (dose 1 to dose 4) of 90% compared with a median of 35% with levels <5 µg/mL (P = 0.024) with a similar median reduction in nCD64 (48% vs 20%, P = 0.031).This study establishes cut points in neutrophil stool and blood biomarkers for both biochemical remission and therapeutic trough levels following induction therapy. Further studies that evaluate pharmacodynamic biomarker targets for endoscopic and histologic healing are warranted.© 2020 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press.

  Title: Achieving Target Infliximab Drug Concentrations Improves Blood and Fecal Neutrophil Biomarkers in Crohn's Disease.
  Abstract: The neutrophil fecal biomarkers, calprotectin (FCP) and lactoferrin (LCT), and peripheral blood neutrophil CD64 surface receptor (nCD64) are biomarkers for mucosal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although FCP has been evaluated as a biomarker for mucosal healing, cut points for LCT and nCD64 are less known. We aimed to identify the cut points for LCT and nCD64 that were associated with FCP remission, with a secondary aim to evaluate the relationship between biochemical outcomes and infliximab (IFX) trough concentrations.We analyzed FCP, LCT, and nCD64 before and after IFX induction in a pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) cohort study. Week-14 FCP biomarker remission was defined as FCP <250 µg/g, with clinical response defined as a weighted Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index <12.5 or Δ>17.5 improvement. Predictive outcomes were calculated by receiver operating characteristics (ROCs).Among 56 CD patients, ROC analysis identified an infusion 4 LCT <8.06 (area under the receiver operator characteristics [AUROC], 0.934, P < 0.001) and nCD64 <6.12 (AUROC, 0.76, P = 0.02) as the ideal cut points for week-14 FCP biomarker remission. End of induction IFX-trough of >9.4 µg/mL (AUROC, 0.799, P = 0.002) and >11.5 µg/mL (AUROC, 0.835, P = 0.003) were associated with a FCP <250 and FCP <100, respectively. We found patients achieving end of induction trough >5 µg/mL had a median FCP improvement (dose 1 to dose 4) of 90% compared with a median of 35% with levels <5 µg/mL (P = 0.024) with a similar median reduction in nCD64 (48% vs 20%, P = 0.031).This study establishes cut points in neutrophil stool and blood biomarkers for both biochemical remission and therapeutic trough levels following induction therapy. Further studies that evaluate pharmacodynamic biomarker targets for endoscopic and histologic healing are warranted.© 2020 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press.

  Title: Emulsifiers Impact Colonic Length in Mice and Emulsifier Restriction is Feasible in People with Crohn's Disease.
  Abstract: There is an association between food additive emulsifiers and the prevalence of Crohn's disease. This study aimed to investigate: (i) the effect of different classes of emulsifiers on markers of intestinal inflammation in mice and (ii) the feasibility, nutritional adequacy and symptom impact of restricting all emulsifier classes in Crohn's disease. Mice were exposed to different classes of emulsifiers (carboxymethycellose, polysorbate-80, soy lecithin, gum arabic) in drinking water for 12-weeks, after which markers of inflammation and metabolism were measured. A low emulsifier diet was developed to restrict all classes of emulsifiers and its feasibility measured over 14-days in 20 participants with stable Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease-related symptoms, disease control, body weight and composition, nutrient intake and food-related quality of life (QoL) were measured. All emulsifiers resulted in lower murine colonic length compared with control (mean 9.5 cm (SEM 0.20)), but this only reached significance for polysorbate-80 (8.2 cm (0.34), p = 0.024) and carboxymethylcellulose (8.0 cm (0.35), p = 0.013). All 20 participants completed the feasibility study. The frequency of consuming emulsifier-containing foods decreased by 94.6% (SD 10.3%). Food-related QoL improved between habitual (median 81.5 (IQR 25.0)) and low emulsifier diet (90.0 (24.0), p = 0.028). Crohn's disease-related symptoms reduced (median 3.0 (IQR 5.3) vs. 1.4 (3.9), p = 0.006), and disease control scores improved (13.5 (IQR 6.0) vs. 15.5 (IQR 3.0), p = 0.026). A range of emulsifiers may influence intestinal inflammation in mice, and dietary restriction of emulsifiers is feasible. Trials investigating the efficacy of a low emulsifier diet in Crohn's disease are warranted.

  Title: Mechanisms of indigo naturalis on treating ulcerative colitis explored by GEO gene chips combined with network pharmacology and molecular docking.
  Abstract: Oral administration of indigo naturalis (IN) can induce remission in ulcerative colitis (UC); however, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. The main active components and targets of IN were obtained by searching three traditional Chinese medicine network databases such as TCMSP and five Targets fishing databases such as PharmMapper. UC disease targets were obtained from three disease databases such as DrugBank,combined with four GEO gene chips. IN-UC targets were identified by matching the two. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed, and the core targets were screened according to the topological structure. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis and bioGPS localization were performed,and an Herbs-Components-Targets network, a Compound Targets-Organs location network, and a Core Targets-Signal Pathways network were established. Molecular docking technology was used to verify the main compounds-targets. Ten core active components and 184 compound targets of IN-UC, of which 43 were core targets, were enriched and analyzed by bioGPS, GO, and KEGG. The therapeutic effect of IN on UC may involve activation of systemic immunity, which is involved in the regulation of nuclear transcription, protein phosphorylation, cytokine activity, reactive oxygen metabolism, epithelial cell proliferation, and cell apoptosis through Th17 cell differentiation, the Jak-STAT and IL-17 signaling pathways, toll-like and NOD-like receptors, and other cellular and innate immune signaling pathways. The molecular mechanism underlying the effect of IN on inducing UC remission was predicted using a network pharmacology method, thereby providing a theoretical basis for further study of the effective components and mechanism of IN in the treatment of UC.

  Title: No Difference of Adalimumab Pharmacokinetics When Dosed at 40 mg Every Week or 80 mg Every Other Week in IBD Patients in Clinical Remission After Adalimumab Dose Intensification.
  Abstract: The pharmacokinetic equivalence of dose intensification with adalimumab (ADA) 80 mg every other week (EOW) compared to weekly 40 mg has only been supported by modeling systems.To compare the trough levels of ADA (TLA) and the occurrence of anti-ADA antibodies (AAA) between these two treatment regimens.This was a prospective study including all consecutive patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who had reached a longstanding and deep remission under treatment with ADA 40 mg once a week. In these patients, the ADA regimen was changed from 40 mg/week to 80 mg EOW. TLA and AAA levels using a drug-tolerant assay were monitored before and ten weeks after from the change in the ADA regimen and the results compared by a Wilcoxon paired test.Sixty-two patients (60% CD, mean age 35 years) were included. Before and ten weeks after the changes of ADA regimen, the median TLA were (6.9 µg/mL versus 7.0 µg/mL, respectively; P = 0.34) and the AAA levels (3.4 µg/ml-eq versus 3.0 µg/ml-eq, respectively; P = 0.25.) were quite similar. Likewise, quartiles of TLA (Kendall test r = 0.91; P < 0.001) and AAA (r = 0.78; P < 0.001) did not differ before and after ADA regimen. When stratifying all the patients into 4 groups based on drug/antibody levels (immunogenic, subtherapeutic, therapeutic, or supratherapeutic), no patient needed for returning to the previous weekly regimen. In terms of acceptability, more than 60% of patients preferred an injection EOW compared once a week.In IBD patients who achieved a deep clinical remission under ADA 40 mg once a week, the pharmacokinetic of ADA was similar when ADA regimen was changed to 80 mg EOW. Given the patient's preference for the latter regimen, a modification of injection regimen should be systematically proposed.© 2020. Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

  Title: Nanocomposites-based targeted oral drug delivery systems with infliximab in a murine colitis model.
  Abstract: Infliximab (IFX), a TNF-α blocking chimeric monoclonal antibody, induces clinical response and mucosal healing in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, systemic administration of this agent causes unwanted side effects. Oral delivery of antibody therapeutics might be an effective treatment strategy for IBD compared to intravenous administration.All three carriers had a high encapsulation efficiency, narrow size distribution, and minimal systemic exposure. There was a higher interaction between nanocomposite carriers and monocytes compared to lymphocytes in the PBMC of IBD patients. Orally administered nanocomposite carriers targeted to inflamed colitis minimized systemic exposure. All IFX delivery formulations with nanocomposite carriers had a significantly less colitis-induced body weight loss, colon shortening and histomorphological score, compared to the DSS-treated group. AC-IFX-L and EAC-IFX-L groups showed significantly higher improvement of the disease activity index, compared to the DSS-treated group. In addition, AC-IFX-L and EAC-IFX-L alleviated pro-inflammatory cytokine expressions (Tnfa, Il1b, and Il17).We present orally administered antibody delivery systems which improved efficacy in murine colitis while reducing systemic exposure. These oral delivery systems suggest a promising therapeutic approach for treating IBD.

  Title: Effect of Exclusive Enteral Nutrition on Th17 Cells in Juvenile Rats with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Abstract: The objective was to investigate the effect of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) on T helper (Th) 17 cells by observing the effects of EEN on colon and serum interleukin (IL)-17A levels in juvenile inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) rat models and to reveal the potential mechanism of the therapeutic effect of EEN on IBD. ATNBS-induced IBD rat model was established. Feeding Peptison, a type of enteric nutrition (EN) for EEN-IBD group and EEN group, normal feed for IBD model group and control group for six consecutive days. Four groups of juvenile rats were sacrificed on day 7. The pathology of the intestinal mucosa was examined, the expression of IL-17A in serum was detected by ELISA, and the expression of IL-17A in intestinal tissue was detected by both western blot and real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Diarrhea, bloody stools, and weight loss were found in both the IBD group and the EEN-IBD group. After 5 days of EEN feeding, the stool characteristics, and blood in the stools of the rats in the EEN-IBD group were significantly relieved compared with those of the IBD group. There was no significant difference in the body mass growth rate between the IBD group and EEN-IBD group (P > 0.05). The growth rate of the EEN group was 51.29 ± 3.61%, which was significantly lower than that of the control group (60.17 ± 9.32%) with P < 0.05. The disease activity index (DAI) score of the EEN-IBD group was significantly lower than that of the IBD group (P < 0.05). In the IBD group, colonic congestion and edema were obvious, scattered ulcers were observed, and the intestinal mucosa had a large amount of inflammatory cell infiltration. In the EEN-IBD group, the intestinal mucosa was slightly congested and a small amount of inflammatory cell infiltrated. The serum IL-17A expression level in the IBD group was significantly higher than in the EEN-IBD group, control group, and EEN group (P < 0.05). Both the gene and protein expressions of IL-17A in the intestinal tissue of the EEN-IBD group were significantly lower than in the IBD group (P < 0.01), and it was significantly higher in the IBD group than in the control and EEN groups (P < 0.01). EEN effectively reduced the intestinal inflammation in the juvenile rats with IBD. The mechanism could be related to the regulation of Th17 cells and the expression of the corresponding cytokine, IL-17A. EEN may play a role in downregulating the expression of IL-17A in the intestinal mucosa.

  Title: Effect of Exclusive Enteral Nutrition on Th17 Cells in Juvenile Rats with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Abstract: The objective was to investigate the effect of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) on T helper (Th) 17 cells by observing the effects of EEN on colon and serum interleukin (IL)-17A levels in juvenile inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) rat models and to reveal the potential mechanism of the therapeutic effect of EEN on IBD. ATNBS-induced IBD rat model was established. Feeding Peptison, a type of enteric nutrition (EN) for EEN-IBD group and EEN group, normal feed for IBD model group and control group for six consecutive days. Four groups of juvenile rats were sacrificed on day 7. The pathology of the intestinal mucosa was examined, the expression of IL-17A in serum was detected by ELISA, and the expression of IL-17A in intestinal tissue was detected by both western blot and real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Diarrhea, bloody stools, and weight loss were found in both the IBD group and the EEN-IBD group. After 5 days of EEN feeding, the stool characteristics, and blood in the stools of the rats in the EEN-IBD group were significantly relieved compared with those of the IBD group. There was no significant difference in the body mass growth rate between the IBD group and EEN-IBD group (P > 0.05). The growth rate of the EEN group was 51.29 ± 3.61%, which was significantly lower than that of the control group (60.17 ± 9.32%) with P < 0.05. The disease activity index (DAI) score of the EEN-IBD group was significantly lower than that of the IBD group (P < 0.05). In the IBD group, colonic congestion and edema were obvious, scattered ulcers were observed, and the intestinal mucosa had a large amount of inflammatory cell infiltration. In the EEN-IBD group, the intestinal mucosa was slightly congested and a small amount of inflammatory cell infiltrated. The serum IL-17A expression level in the IBD group was significantly higher than in the EEN-IBD group, control group, and EEN group (P < 0.05). Both the gene and protein expressions of IL-17A in the intestinal tissue of the EEN-IBD group were significantly lower than in the IBD group (P < 0.01), and it was significantly higher in the IBD group than in the control and EEN groups (P < 0.01). EEN effectively reduced the intestinal inflammation in the juvenile rats with IBD. The mechanism could be related to the regulation of Th17 cells and the expression of the corresponding cytokine, IL-17A. EEN may play a role in downregulating the expression of IL-17A in the intestinal mucosa.

  Title: The endogenous ligand for guanylate cyclase-C activation reliefs intestinal inflammation in the DSS colitis model.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a major type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and significantly impacts patient quality of life. Previous research revealed that the guanylate cyclase-C (GC-C) signaling pathway is associated with the severity of UC. We aimed to investigate the effect of the GC-C agonist, guanylin (Gn), on inflammatory injury in mice with colitis. An experimental UC model was established in Balb/c mice. Mesalamine served as a positive control. The Gn overexpression vector was administered once per day for 1 week. Intestinal permeability of the mice was measured using fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran after the treatment. Histopathologic grading was estimated to assess the inflammatory injury of the colon. The expression level of crucial mediators of the GC-C signaling pathway (Gn, Ugn and GC-C) and tight junction proteins (occludin, claudin-1 and ZO-1) was measured in the colon. Additionally, the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-8 and TNF-α) in serum was measured. After injecting the UC mice with the Gn overexpression vector, the body weight increased, and the frequency of loose stools and bloody stools was decreased. Intestinal permeability and histopathologic score were significantly reduced (P<0.05). The expression level of GC-C, Gn, Ugn, claudin-1 and ZO-1 was significantly increased (P<0.05). The level of IL-8 and TNF-α in the serum was significantly decreased (P<0.01). Therefore, the application of Gn overexpression vector can ameliorate the intestinal inflammatory injury and repair the mucosal barrier in colitis mice, which further suggests the clinical therapeutic potential of GC-C agonists in IBD.

  Title: IgA, albumin, and eosinopenia as early indicators of cytomegalovirus infection in patients with acute ulcerative colitis.
  Abstract: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection can significantly complicate and worsen the condition of acute severe ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. We aimed to explore the predictive risk factors to prevent and identify CMV infection at an early stage in acute UC patients.A total of 115 moderate-to-severe active UC patients from 17 hospitals throughout China were enrolled. Active CMV infection was diagnosed by one of the following: CMV pp65 antigens, CMV IgM antibodies or CMV DNA. We identified the independent risk factors by multivariate analyses.A total of 64 of 115 active UC patients had active CMV infection. Compared to the non-CMV-infected patients, the CMV-infected patients had a tendency to be male and to exhibit abdominal pain; fever; oral ulcers; eosinopenia; low albumin, immunoglobulin (Ig) A, IgM, and IgG levels; increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels; hyponatremia; pancolonic lesions; initial onset type; severe activity; and glucocorticoid (high-dose) and immunosuppressive agent use (P < 0.05). In further multivariate analyses, the use of high-dose glucocorticoids (OR 13.55, 95% CI 2.49-73.61, P < 0.01) and immunosuppressive agents (OR 11.23, 95% CI 1.05-119.99, P = 0.04) were independent risk factors for CMV infection. A decrease eosinophil and albumin levels were risk factors for CMV infection. With every 0.1*10^9/L decrease in the peripheral blood eosinophil level or 1 g/L decrease in the serum albumin level, the risk for CMV infection in UC patients increased by 5.21-fold (1/0.192) or 1.19-fold (1/0.839), respectively.High-dose glucocorticoid and immunosuppressive agent treatment significantly increase the risk of CMV infection, and correcting eosinopenia and low albumin levels may help prevent CMV infection in UC patients.

  Title: The Antimicrobial Cathelicidin CRAMP Augments Platelet Activation during Psoriasis in Mice.
  Abstract: Platelet-associated complications including thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and haemorrhage are commonly observed during various inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis. Although several mechanisms that may contribute to the dysfunction of platelets during inflammatory diseases have been reported, knowledge on the primary molecules/mechanisms that underpin platelet-associated complications in such conditions is not fully established. Here, we report the significance of the mouse antimicrobial cathelicidin, mouse cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (mCRAMP) (an orthologue of LL37 in humans), on the modulation of platelet reactivity during psoriasis using Imiquimod-induced psoriasis in mice as an inflammatory disease model for psoriasis vulgaris in humans. The activation of platelets during psoriasis is increased as evidenced by the elevated levels of fibrinogen binding and P-selectin exposure on the surface of platelets, and the level of soluble P-selectin in the plasma of psoriatic mice. The skin and plasma of psoriatic mice displayed increased levels of mCRAMP. Moreover, the plasma of psoriatic mice augmented the activation of platelets obtained from healthy mice. The effect of mCRAMP is partially mediated through formyl peptide receptor 2/3 (Fpr2/3, the orthologue to human FPR2/ALX) in platelets as a significant reduction in their activation was observed when FPR2/ALX-selective inhibitors such as WRW4 or Fpr2/3-deficient mouse platelets were used in these assays. Since the level of antimicrobial cathelicidin is increased in numerous inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, atherosclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease, the results of this study point towards a critical role for antimicrobial cathelicidin and FPR2/ALX in the development of platelet-related complications in such diseases.

  Title: Thiopurines and their optimization during infliximab induction and maintenance: A retrospective study in Crohn's disease.
  Abstract: Combining therapy with a thiopurine is favored when commencing infliximab in Crohn's disease; however, the optimal 6-thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) level and how long to continue thiopurines after induction are uncertain. We aimed to compare outcomes after induction and during maintenance in combination therapy versus infliximab monotherapy in Crohn's and to examine whether TGN levels were associated with outcomes.Crohn's patients induced with infliximab with or without concomitant thiopurines were retrospectively identified. Response to induction and clinical outcomes in subsequent 6-month maintenance semesters were analyzed. A TGN level ≥235 pmol/8 × 108 red blood cells was considered therapeutic.In 89 patients, response to induction was higher in combination therapy than monotherapy (74 vs 47%, P = 0.04). This benefit was only seen in patients with a therapeutic TGN (odds ratio 3.72, confidence interval 1.07-13.0, P = 0.04). Combination therapy during induction yielded a three times longer time to subsequent need for treatment escalation or treatment failure compared with monotherapy (29 vs 9 months, P = 0.01), with both therapeutic and subtherapeutic TGNs independent predictors on multivariate analysis. Among 370 semesters, there was no difference in outcomes between combination therapy and monotherapy (P = 0.42), nor when combination semesters were stratified by therapeutic versus subtherapeutic TGN (P = 0.56). In semester 1 only, a significantly higher remission rate was observed with therapeutic compared with subtherapeutic TGN (76% vs 33%, P = 0.02).Combination therapy dosed with an optimized thiopurine was superior to infliximab monotherapy for induction of response, durability of response, and clinical outcomes in the first 6 months following induction. Thereafter, combination therapy yielded no clinical advantage, supporting consideration of thiopurine withdrawal on a case-by-case basis.© 2020 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

Combination therapy during induction yielded a three times longer time to subsequent need for treatment escalation or treatment failure compared with monotherapy (29 vs 9 months, P = 0.01), with both therapeutic and subtherapeutic TGNs independent predictors on multivariate analysis. Among 370 semesters, there was no difference in outcomes between combination therapy and monotherapy (P = 0.42), nor when combination semesters were stratified by therapeutic versus subtherapeutic TGN (P = 0.56). In semester 1 only, a significantly higher remission rate was observed with therapeutic compared with subtherapeutic TGN (76% vs 33%, P = 0.02).Combination therapy dosed with an optimized thiopurine was superior to infliximab monotherapy for induction of response, durability of response, and clinical outcomes in the first 6 months following induction. Thereafter, combination therapy yielded no clinical advantage, supporting consideration of thiopurine withdrawal on a case-by-case basis.© 2020 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

  Title: Abdominal pain in quiescent inflammatory bowel disease.
  Abstract: Inflammation is an important driver of abdominal pain in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, some patients in remission still experience pain. We aimed to identify risk factors associated with abdominal pain in quiescent IBD (QP-IBD) and to characterize differences from patients with active disease experiencing pain (AP-IBD).We performed a retrospective analysis utilizing data from our institution's IBD Natural History Registry (January 1, 2015-August 31, 2018). Endoscopic evaluation, concurrent laboratory studies, and validated surveys were completed by participants. Demographic and clinical data were also abstracted.We recruited 122 patients with quiescent disease (65f:57 m; 93CD:26UC:3Indeterminate) for participation in this study, 74 (60.7%) had QP-IBD. QP-IBD patients were more likely to have anxiety/depression (71.6% vs. 25.0%, p < 0.001) or to use antidepressants (47.3% vs. 22.9%, p < 0.010), opiates (18.9% vs. 2.1%, p < 0.010), other pain medications (50.0% vs. 18.8%, p < 0.010), or corticosteroids (18.9% vs. 2.1%, p < 0.010). On logistic regression analysis, corticosteroid use, anxious/depressed state, and female gender were each independently associated with QP-IBD (p < 0.050 or less). Compared with AP-IBD patients (n = 110, 59f:51 m; 69CD:38UC:3Indeterminate), QP-IBD patients were more likely to use antidepressants (45.6% vs. 26.4%, p < 0.010). Platelet, white blood cell, C-reactive protein, and sedimentation rate levels were all less likely to be elevated in QP-IBD (all p < 0.050), though 44% exhibited pathological elevation in at least one.QP-IBD was independently associated with corticosteroid use, anxiety/depression, and female gender. Compared with AP-IBD, QP-IBD patients were more likely to use antidepressants and less likely to exhibit elevated inflammatory markers. However, many QP-IBD patients still demonstrated pathological elevation of these tests, demonstrating the need to develop new noninvasive screening methods for this condition.

  Title: Lipid Profiles in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis Receiving Tofacitinib-Implications for Cardiovascular Risk and Patient Management.
  Abstract: Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are at elevated risk of cardiovascular disease vs the general population, despite a lower prevalence of traditional risk factors, including hyperlipidemia. Mechanistic studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis suggest that tofacitinib restores serum lipids to preinflammation levels by reversing inflammation-induced cholesterol metabolism changes. We reviewed data on lipid levels and cardiovascular events, alongside recommendations for managing lipid levels during tofacitinib treatment in patients with UC, based on up-to-date expert guidelines.Data were identified from a phase 3/open-label, long-term extension (OLE) tofacitinib UC clinical program (cutoff May 27, 2019). Literature was identified from PubMed (search terms "lipid," "cholesterol," "lipoprotein," "cardiovascular," "inflammation," "atherosclerosis," "tofacitinib," "rheumatoid arthritis," "psoriasis," "inflammatory bowel disease," "ulcerative colitis," "hyperlipidemia," and "guidelines") and author knowledge. Data were available from 4 phase 3 clinical trials of 1124 patients with moderately to severely active UC who received ≥1 dose of tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg twice daily in induction (two identical trials), maintenance, and OLE studies (treatment duration ≤6.8 years; 2576.4 patient-years of drug exposure).In the OLE study, tofacitinib treatment was not associated with major changes from baseline in total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, with lipid levels and ratios generally remaining stable over time. The major adverse cardiovascular events incidence rate was 0.26/100 patient-years (95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.54).Lipid levels and ratios remained generally unchanged from baseline in the OLE study after tofacitinib treatment, and major adverse cardiovascular events were infrequent.

  Title: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor is elevated in the blood serum of Crohn's disease patients, but is not influenced by anti-TNF-α treatment-A pilot study.
  Abstract: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is associated with depression, pain, or sleep disorders, factors that are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis and clinical course of Crohn's disease (CD). Therefore, the study aimed at assessing the BDNF serum level in patients with CD and evaluates the effect of anti-TNF-α therapy on the BDNF level and its impact on sleep, mood, and pain parameters.Fifty-eight CD patients and 26 healthy controls (HC) were included in the study. The severity of insomnia symptoms was assessed by the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS). Subjective pain intensity was estimated by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Laitinen Pain Scale. Mood level was measured using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Seventeen patients were treated with anti-TNF-α therapy for 14 weeks and were re-examined after treatment.CD patients had a higher serum BDNF level than HC (P = .010). No correlation between clinical severity and BDNF was found. There were positive correlations between the BDNF level and the results of AIS (r = 0.253, P = .020), the severity of pain measured using the VAS (r = 0.251, P = .021) and the Laitinen Pain Scale (r = 0.218, P = .047), but not BDI. No differences were observed in the BDNF level before and after 14 weeks of anti-TNF-α therapy.Increased BDNF level in CD patients suggests that it may be involved in the pathogenesis and clinical course of the disease. Further research into BDNF might contribute to a better understanding of the effects of sleep and pain on the course of CD.© 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

  Title: Intermittent Purpura Development Associated with Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis Induced by Infliximab for Crohn's Disease.
  Abstract: Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α agents, widely used for the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD), can sometimes induce skin-associated adverse events, which mainly include psoriasis-like eruptions, eczema, and cutaneous infections. In contrast, purpura caused by vasculitis is rarely seen. We herein report a unique case of leukocytoclastic vasculitis induced by infliximab administered for CD in which intermittent purpura development was noted. Fluorescent immunostaining showed no immunoglobulin A deposition on the vessel walls. No purpura was initially seen after starting infliximab, but it appeared approximately 10 months later; however, administration did not have to be discontinued, and the condition was later resolved. The present findings provide important details regarding vasculitis induced by anti-tumor necrosis factor-α agent administration.

  Title: Angiogenin maintains gut microbe homeostasis by balancing α-Proteobacteria and Lachnospiraceae.
  Abstract: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play essential roles in maintaining gut health and are associated with IBD. This study is to elucidate the effect of angiogenin (ANG), an intestine-secreted AMP, on gut microbiota and its relevance with IBD.The effect of ANG on microbiota and its contribution to colitis were evaluated in different colitis models with co-housing and faecal microbiota transplantation. ANG-regulated bacteria were determined by 16S rDNA sequencing and their functions in colitis were analysed by bacterial colonisation. The species-specific antimicrobial activity of ANG and its underlying mechanism were further investigated with microbiological and biochemical methods. ANG level and the key bacteria were characterised in IBD faecal samples.ANG regulated microbiota composition and inhibited intestinal inflammation. Specifically, Ang1 deficiency in mice led to a decrease in the protective gut commensal strains of Lachnospiraceae but an increase in the colitogenic strains of α-Proteobacteria. Direct binding of ANG to α-Proteobacteria resulted in lethal disruption of bacterial membrane integrity, and consequently promoted the growth of Lachnospiraceae, which otherwise was antagonised by α-Proteobacteria. Oral administration of ANG1 reversed the dysbiosis and attenuated the severity of colitis in Ang1-deficient mice. The correlation among ANG, the identified bacteria and IBD status was established in patients.These findings demonstrate a novel role of ANG in shaping gut microbe composition and thus maintaining gut health, suggesting that the ANG-microbiota axis could be developed as a potential preventive and/or therapeutic approach for dysbiosis-related gut diseases.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

  Title: Role of MicroRNAs in the Progression and Metastasis of Colon Cancer.
  Abstract: MicroRNAs regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by binding to the mRNA of their target genes. The dysfunction of miRNAs is strongly associated with the inflammation of the colon. Besides, some microRNAs are shown to suppress tumours, while others promote tumour progression and metastasis. Inflammatory bowel diseases include Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis, which increase the risk factor for inflammation-associated colon cancer. MicroRNAs are shown to be involved in gastrointestinal pathologies by targeting the transcripts encoding proteins of the intestinal barrier and their regulators that are associated with inflammation and colon cancer. Detection of these microRNAs in the blood, serum, tissues, faecal matter, etc, will enable us to use these microRNAs as biomarkers for early detection of the associated malignancies and design novel therapeutic strategies to overcome the same. Information on MicroRNAs can be applied for the development of targeted therapies against inflammation-mediated colon cancer.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.

  Title: Role of MicroRNAs in the Progression and Metastasis of Colon Cancer.
  Abstract: MicroRNAs regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by binding to the mRNA of their target genes. The dysfunction of miRNAs is strongly associated with the inflammation of the colon. Besides, some microRNAs are shown to suppress tumours, while others promote tumour progression and metastasis. Inflammatory bowel diseases include Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis, which increase the risk factor for inflammation-associated colon cancer. MicroRNAs are shown to be involved in gastrointestinal pathologies by targeting the transcripts encoding proteins of the intestinal barrier and their regulators that are associated with inflammation and colon cancer. Detection of these microRNAs in the blood, serum, tissues, faecal matter, etc, will enable us to use these microRNAs as biomarkers for early detection of the associated malignancies and design novel therapeutic strategies to overcome the same. Information on MicroRNAs can be applied for the development of targeted therapies against inflammation-mediated colon cancer.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.

  Title: A Dynamic Quantitative Systems Pharmacology Model of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Part 2 - Application to Current Therapies in Crohn's Disease.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a heterogeneic disease with a variety of treatments targeting different mechanisms. A multistate, mechanistic, mathematical model of IBD was developed in part 1 of this two-part article series. In this paper, application of the model to predict response of key clinical biomarkers following different treatment options for Crohn's disease was explored. Five therapies, representing four different mechanisms of action, were simulated in the model and longitudinal profiles of key clinical markers, C-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin were compared with clinical observations. Model simulations provided an accurate match with both central tendency and variability observed in biomarker profiles. We also applied the model to predict biomarker and clinical response in an experimental, combination therapy of existing therapeutic options and provide possible mechanistic basis for the increased response. Overall, we present a validated, modular, mechanistic model construct, which can be applied to explore key biomarkers and clinical outcomes in IBD.© 2020 Pfizer Inc.

  Title: Characterization of Creatine Kinase Levels in Tofacitinib-Treated Patients with Ulcerative Colitis: Results from Clinical Trials.
  Abstract: Tofacitinib is an oral, small-molecule JAK inhibitor for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). Creatine kinase (CK) levels and CK-related adverse events (AEs) in tofacitinib-treated patients with UC were evaluated.Data were analyzed for three UC cohorts: Induction (phase 2 and 3 induction studies); Maintenance (phase 3 maintenance study); Overall [patients who received tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg twice daily (b.d.) in phase 2, phase 3, or open-label, long-term extension studies; data at November 2017]. Clinical trial data for tofacitinib-treated patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis are presented for contextualization.Week 8 mean change from baseline CK with tofacitinib 10 mg b.d. induction therapy was 91.1 U/L (95% CI, 48.1-134.1) versus 19.2 U/L (8.5-29.9) with placebo. Among patients completing induction with 10 mg b.d. and re-randomized to 52 weeks of maintenance therapy, mean increases from induction baseline to the end of maintenance were 35.9 (8.1-63.7), 90.3 (51.9-128.7), and 115.6 U/L (91.6-139.7), with placebo, 5 and 10 mg b.d., respectively. The incidence rate (unique patients with events per 100 patient-years) for AEs of CK elevation in the tofacitinib-treated UC Overall cohort was 6.6 versus 2.2, 6.5, and 3.7 for tofacitinib-treated patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis, respectively. No serious AEs of CK elevation or AEs of myopathy occurred in UC studies.In patients with UC, CK elevations with tofacitinib appeared reversible and not associated with clinically significant AEs. UC findings were consistent with tofacitinib use in other inflammatory diseases.NCT00787202; NCT01465763; NCT01458951; NCT01458574; NCT01470612; NCT01262118; NCT01484561; NCT00147498; NCT00413660; NCT00550446; NCT00603512; NCT00687193; NCT01059864; NCT01164579; NCT00976599; NCT01359150; NCT02147587; NCT00960440; NCT00847613; NCT00814307; NCT00856544; NCT00853385; NCT01039688; NCT02187055; NCT00413699; NCT00661661; NCT01710046; NCT00678210; NCT01276639; NCT01309737; NCT01241591; NCT01186744; NCT01163253; NCT01877668; NCT01882439; NCT01976364.© 2020.

  Title: Type I and II Interferon Signatures Can Predict the Response to Anti-TNF Agents in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: Involvement of the Microbiota.
  Abstract: Anti-TNF agents have been a cornerstone of IBD therapy; however, response to treatment has been variable, and clinically applicable biomarkers are urgently needed. We hypothesized that the type I and type II interferon (IFN) signatures may be a confounding factor for response to antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment via interactions with the host and its gut microbiota.Peripheral blood from 30 IBD patients and 10 healthy controls was subjected to real-time quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for type I and type II IFN genes (IFNGs), both at baseline and after treatment with anti-TNF. Correlation between IFN signatures and microbiota composition was also determined for a subgroup of patients and controls.At baseline, type I IFN score was significantly higher in IBD patients (P = 0.04 vs controls). Responders to subsequent anti-TNF treatment had significantly lower baseline scores for both type I and II IFN signatures (P < 0.005 vs nonresponders for both comparisons). During treatment with anti-TNF, the expression of type I and II IFNGs was significantly elevated in responders and decreased in nonresponders. In addition, changes in IFN signatures correlated to specific alterations in the abundance of several microbial taxa of the gut microbiome.Baseline expression of type I and II IFN signatures and their kinetics during anti-TNF administration significantly correlate to treatment responses in IBD patients. Peripheral blood IFN signatures may serve as clinically meaningful biomarkers for the identification of subgroups of patients with favorable response to anti-TNF treatment. Additionally, the distinct synergies between different IFN types and microbiota might help drive therapeutic intervention.© 2020 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press.

  Title: Immune-related adverse events in a patient with eosinophilic enteritis treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1).
  Abstract: The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in melanoma patients has significantly improved treatment outcomes. Unfortunately, ICI therapy is associated with specific immune-related adverse events (irAEs). There is limited data on the use of ICIs in patients with autoimmune or allergic diseases, because these patients have typically been excluded from clinical trials. Eosinophilic inflammatory bowel disease (primary eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders) is a rare condition defined as eosinophilic infiltration in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract in the absence of other known causes of tissue eosinophilia. We present a case of a 51-year-old woman with eosinophilic enteritis who was treated with anti-PD-1 because of metastatic melanoma. The use of anti-PD-1 therapy in a metastatic melanoma patient with a positive history of eosinophilic enteritis resulted in the appearance of many immune-related complications (hypothyroidism, hepatitis, skin lesions, colitis). The patient discontinued anti-PD-1 treatment and glucocorticoid therapy was started. All AEs have resolved without any sequelae, and there are no symptoms of eosinophilic enteritis. Currently, the patient has no complaints, and has no clinical features of recurrence or dissemination of melanoma (April 2020); she remains under constant oncological supervision. The use of anti-PD-1 therapy in a patient with metastatic melanoma and a positive history of eosinophilic enteritis resulted in almost complete remission of melanoma but also the appearance of many immune-related complications, none of which were life-threatening. Patients with eosinophilic enteritis may be eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy; however, they should be closely monitored for the appearance of various irAEs when receiving this therapy.

  Title: Lipid-based nanocarrier-mediated targeted delivery of celecoxib attenuate severity of ulcerative colitis.
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis is a chronic mucosal inflammatory condition that adversely affects colon and rectum. Celecoxib is a selective inhibitor of inducible cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and is prescribed for the management of pain and other inflammatory disorders. The physicochemical properties of celecoxib limit its clinical potency. Here we developed nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) using Generally Recognized as Safe and US-FDA approved compounds for encapsulating celecoxib. Present study was aimed to evaluate efficacy of eudragit-S100-coated celecoxib-loaded NLCs against DSS-induced colitis in mice. NLCs were formulated by hot-melt method and possessed the average particle size of 250.90 nm and entrapment efficiency (%) was 59.89%. Furthermore, size, shape and morphology of NLCs were confirmed using TEM, SEM and AFM. The blank NLCs were cytocompatible against hTERT-BJ cells up to a dose of 200 μg/ml. Treatment with celecoxib-loaded NLCs alleviated severity of colitis as demonstrated by disease activity index, colon length, fecal occult blood test, and histopathological analysis. Moreover, treatment with celecoxib-loaded NLCs reduced disintegration of goblets cells and restores sulfomucin in colon. Celecoxib-nanoformulation markedly reduced colonic inflammation as evidenced by decreased immunohistochemical expression of COX-2 and iNOS. The observations of study suggest that lipid-based colon specific delivery of celecoxib may be used for management of colitis.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

  Title: Optimization of infliximab therapy in inflammatory bowel disease using a dashboard approach-an Indian experience.
  Abstract: Infliximab (IFX) therapy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with loss of response in half the patients, due to complex pharmacokinetic and immunological factors. Dashboard's Bayesian algorithms use information from model and individual multivariate determinants of IFX concentration and can predict dose and dosing interval.To compare measured IFX concentrations in our laboratory with values predicted by iDose dashboard system and report its efficacy in managing patients not responding to conventional dosing schedule.Clinical history, demographic details, and laboratory findings such as albumin and C-reactive protein (CRP) data of IBD patients (n = 30; median age 23 years (IQR: 14.25 - 33.5)) referred for IFX drug monitoring in our laboratory from November 2017 to November 2019 were entered in iDose software. The IFX concentration predicted by iDose based on this information was compared with that measured in our laboratory. In addition, a prospective dashboard-guided dosing was prescribed in 11 of these 30 patients not responding to conventional dosing and was followed to assess their clinical outcome.IFX monitoring in our 30 patients had shown therapeutic concentration in 12, supratherapeutic in 2 and subtherapeutic concentration in 16 patients. The iDose predicted concentration showed concordance in 21 of these 30 patients. Of 11 patients managed with iDose-assisted prospective dosing, 8 achieved clinical remission, 2 showed partial response, and one developed antibodies.Retrospective data analysis showed concordance between laboratory measured and iDose-predicted IFX level in 70% of patients. iDose-assisted management achieved clinical remission and cost reduction.

  Title: Optimization of infliximab therapy in inflammatory bowel disease using a dashboard approach-an Indian experience.
  Abstract: Infliximab (IFX) therapy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with loss of response in half the patients, due to complex pharmacokinetic and immunological factors. Dashboard's Bayesian algorithms use information from model and individual multivariate determinants of IFX concentration and can predict dose and dosing interval.To compare measured IFX concentrations in our laboratory with values predicted by iDose dashboard system and report its efficacy in managing patients not responding to conventional dosing schedule.Clinical history, demographic details, and laboratory findings such as albumin and C-reactive protein (CRP) data of IBD patients (n = 30; median age 23 years (IQR: 14.25 - 33.5)) referred for IFX drug monitoring in our laboratory from November 2017 to November 2019 were entered in iDose software. The IFX concentration predicted by iDose based on this information was compared with that measured in our laboratory. In addition, a prospective dashboard-guided dosing was prescribed in 11 of these 30 patients not responding to conventional dosing and was followed to assess their clinical outcome.IFX monitoring in our 30 patients had shown therapeutic concentration in 12, supratherapeutic in 2 and subtherapeutic concentration in 16 patients. The iDose predicted concentration showed concordance in 21 of these 30 patients. Of 11 patients managed with iDose-assisted prospective dosing, 8 achieved clinical remission, 2 showed partial response, and one developed antibodies.Retrospective data analysis showed concordance between laboratory measured and iDose-predicted IFX level in 70% of patients. iDose-assisted management achieved clinical remission and cost reduction.

  Title: Melatonin Alleviates Neuroinflammation and Metabolic Disorder in DSS-Induced Depression Rats.
  Abstract: There is a bidirectional relationship between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and depression/anxiety. Emerging evidences indicate that the liver may be involved in microbiota-gut-brain axis. This experiment focused on the role of melatonin in regulating the gut microbiota and explores its mechanism on dextran sulphate sodium- (DSS-) induced neuroinflammation and liver injury. Long-term DSS-treatment increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS), proinflammation cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α, and gut leak in rats, breaking blood-brain barrier and overactivated astrocytes and microglia. Ultimately, the rats showed depression-like behavior, including reduction of sucrose preference and central time in open field test and elevation of immobility time in a forced swimming test. Oral administration with melatonin alleviated neuroinflammation and depression-like behaviors. However, melatonin supplementation did not decrease the level of LPS but increase short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production to protect DSS-induced neuroinflammation. Additionally, western blotting analysis suggested that signaling pathways farnesoid X receptor-fibroblast growth factor 15 (FXR-FGF 15) in gut and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) in the liver overactivated in DSS-treated rats, indicating liver metabolic disorder. Supplementation with melatonin markedly inhibited the activation of these two signaling pathways and its downstream p38. As for the gut microbiota, we found that immune response- and SCFA production-related microbiota, like Lactobacillus and Clostridium significantly increased, while bile salt hydrolase activity-related microbiota, like Streptococcus and Enterococcus, significantly decreased after melatonin supplementation. These altered microbiota were consistent with the alleviation of neuroinflammation and metabolic disorder. Taken together, our findings suggest melatonin contributes to reshape gut microbiota and improves inflammatory processes in the hippocampus (HPC) and metabolic disorders in the liver of DSS rats.Copyright © 2020 Wei-jie Lv et al.

  Title: Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis in an Ulcerative Colitis Patient During Treatment with Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha Antagonist.
  Abstract: A 45-year-old man with steroid-dependent ulcerative pancolitis was hospitalized with frequent diarrhea, abdominal pain and distension 3 months after induction of golimumab, a tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonist. Computed tomography showed wall thickening from the stomach to the colon and massive ascites. Peripheral blood test revealed eosinophilia. A large number of eosinophils were observed in the ascites fluid. Although esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed no abnormal findings and colonoscopy showed ulcerative colitis with a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 1, eosinophil infiltration was histologically observed. Based on these findings, we diagnosed him with eosinophilic gastroenteritis and started prednisolone. Consequently, his eosinophil counts and abdominal symptoms dramatically improved.

  Title: Loperamide Abuse and Its Sequelae.
  Abstract: Loperamide is an opioid available over the counter and in prescription form. Loperamide functions as a μ-agonist within the enteric nervous system to slow intestinal motility. Its antidiarrheal properties and primarily peripheral activity make loperamide an important tool in the management of inflammatory bowel disease.A 42-year-old man was found unconscious in cardiac arrest, and emergency medical personnel restored normal sinus rhythm. Family reported complaints of abdominal pain and that he "went through a lot" of loperamide. In the emergency department, the patient exhibited symptoms consistent with an opioid overdose. Mental status improved after administration of naloxone, an opioid antagonist. An electrocardiogram revealed a prolonged QTc interval, which progressed into Torsades de Pointes rhythm during admission. The patient succumbed from hypoxic brain injury, and there was evidence of acute pancreatitis at autopsy. Loperamide and desmethylloperamide (loperamide metabolite) were detected in blood samples. Cause of death was ruled loperamide toxicity.Because of reduced central nervous system activity and associated euphoria at therapeutic doses, loperamide abuse is rarely reported. This case demonstrates that an overdose on loperamide can occur in patients seeking symptom alleviation, and may mimic the presentation of opioid overdose.

  Title: Pharmacoproteomics reveals the mechanism of Chinese dragon's blood in regulating the RSK/TSC2/mTOR/ribosome pathway in alleviation of DSS-induced acute ulcerative colitis.
  Abstract: Chinese dragon's blood (CDB), a crude drug extracted from Dracaena cochinchinensis (Lour.) S.C. Chen, has been historically applied for the treatment of various diseases, including ulcerative colitis (UC). Unfortunately, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear.In this paper, the effects of CDB treatment on a mouse model of acute UC and proteomic variation in colonic tissue were investigated. The acute UC model in Balb/c mice was induced by administration of 2.5% (wt/vol) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for 8 days. After the mice with UC were intragastrically administered CDB and intraperitoneally injected with rapamycin (RAPA, a specific inhibitor of mTORC1), the disease activity index (DAI) and histopathological score were recorded. An isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) based LC-MS/MS proteomic technique was adopted to identify the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in colonic tissue. Bioinformatics analysis was used to discover the molecular functions and pathways of the DEPs. Finally, Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry were used to verify the protein expression.The results showed that CDB treatment significantly ameliorated the symptoms and intestinal damage in acute UC, while RAPA treatment led to severe symptoms and intestinal damage. A total of 489 DEPs were reversed in the control check (CK) group and the CDB group. Most DEPs were enriched in the structural constituents of ribosomes and the ribosome pathway. CDB treatment significantly upregulated the expression of the mTOR, p-mTOR and p70S6K proteins and downregulated the expression of the Akt, p-Akt, and p4EBP1 proteins. However, RAPA treatment, unlike CDB, did not return the levels of mTOR, Akt, and their phosphorylated forms to nearly normal.In conclusion, the dysfunction of the mTOR/ribosome pathway resulting in the inhibition of ribosome synthesis played an important role in the development of acute UC in mice, and CDB, but not RAPA, was an alternative drug for the treatment of acute UC by enhancing ribosome synthesis via the mTOR/ribosome pathway and further promoting protein synthesis.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

  Title: Golimumab in adolescents with Crohn's disease refractory to previous tumour necrosis factor antibody.
  Abstract: Anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α drugs are effective treatments for the management of moderate/severe Crohn's disease (CD), but treatment failure is common. In the treatment of paediatric CD, there are no data about the use of a third introduced subcutaneous TNF antibody golimumab.We evaluated the efficacy of golimumab for adolescents with moderate/severe CD. Retrospective analyses were done in all 7 (5 girls) adolescents who received golimumab at a median age of 17 years for a median of 7.2 months. Paediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI), full blood count, inflammatory markers, use of corticosteroids and adverse events were recorded.With golimumab, 5 of the 7 children were PCDAI responders and 2 entered remission (PCDAI <10). Faecal calprotectin was significantly reduced after 4 weeks compared to baseline. Out of five children, steroid withdrawal was possible in one and steroid reduction in two cases. There were no serious side effects.In moderate/severe CD, golimumab induced clinical remission with PCDAI response. Golimumab may be an effective rescue therapy in refractory CD.© 2020 The Authors.

  Title: Cerebral Vascular Thrombosis Associated With Ulcerative Colitis and Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis.
  Abstract: We report a case of a sudden death of a 23-year-old man with a history of ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis due to cerebral vascular thrombosis. He was found supine in bed with no signs of trauma or drug use. Three days before being found, he had complained of fever and excessive diarrhea. At autopsy, the brain was markedly edematous with diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage over the left cerebral hemisphere. The vessels at the base of the brain were unremarkable, and there was no significant hemorrhage over the inferior surfaces. On sectioning, clotted blood was identified in the left frontal lobe and lateral ventricles. Microscopically, the left cerebral hemisphere showed extensive intraparenchymal hemorrhage, necrosis, and numerous thrombosed leptomeningeal vessels. Sections of the transverse and descending colon showed changes consistent with the history of ulcerative colitis.Cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis represents approximately 1% of all strokes and is a known rare complication associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Symptoms of cerebral venous thrombosis are highly variable and may manifest as headache, focal neurological deficits, seizure, or encephalopathy. In addition to acquired hypercoagulability risk factors patients develop during active disease flares (eg, dehydration), studies suggest that IBD itself represents an independent risk factor for thrombosis. It is important for the forensic pathologist to consider thrombotic complications, particularly those in the cerebral venous system, as potential manifestations of known or undiagnosed IBD.Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

  Title: Pyoderma gangrenosum in an ulcerative colitis patient during treatment with vedolizumab responded favorably to adsorptive granulocyte and monocyte apheresis.
  Abstract: Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an extra-intestinal skin lesion in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as is erythema nodosum. Vedolizumab (VED) is a monoclonal antibody that targets α4β7 integrin and has an intestinal selective mechanism. Despite good therapeutic effects on colitis, the effect on extra-intestinal manifestations (EIMs) remains unclear. Here we report a case of ulcerative colitis complicated by PG during treatment with VED, which was successfully treated with prednisolone in combination with adsorptive granulocyte and monocyte apheresis (GMA). The patient was a 50-year-old woman with a past medical history of extensive ulcerative colitis managed by golimumab (GLM). She developed flare symptoms due to loss of response to GLM, and treatment was switched to VED. Her gastrointestinal symptoms were improved with VED treatment with less frequent bowel movements. However, infiltrative erythema with pain appeared on the right lower leg and right knee, and expanded and gradually ulcerated. Her skin lesions were treated with corticosteroid, but showed poor improvement. Therefore, granulocyte and monocyte apheresis (GMA) treatment was administered in combination with prednisolone. After 3 months, the ulcer gradually improved, and at the time of this writing, the eruptions were nearly replaced by epithelial tissue. This case study showed that patients with UC and EIMS may respond well to combination therapy of VED and GMA. GMA has a very favorable safety profile. On the other hand, the causal connection between VED and PG is still unclear. We believe that a combination therapy involving VED and GMA in IBD patients with EIMs warrants consideration.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

  Title: Pyoderma gangrenosum in an ulcerative colitis patient during treatment with vedolizumab responded favorably to adsorptive granulocyte and monocyte apheresis.
  Abstract: Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an extra-intestinal skin lesion in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as is erythema nodosum. Vedolizumab (VED) is a monoclonal antibody that targets α4β7 integrin and has an intestinal selective mechanism. Despite good therapeutic effects on colitis, the effect on extra-intestinal manifestations (EIMs) remains unclear. Here we report a case of ulcerative colitis complicated by PG during treatment with VED, which was successfully treated with prednisolone in combination with adsorptive granulocyte and monocyte apheresis (GMA). The patient was a 50-year-old woman with a past medical history of extensive ulcerative colitis managed by golimumab (GLM). She developed flare symptoms due to loss of response to GLM, and treatment was switched to VED. Her gastrointestinal symptoms were improved with VED treatment with less frequent bowel movements. However, infiltrative erythema with pain appeared on the right lower leg and right knee, and expanded and gradually ulcerated. Her skin lesions were treated with corticosteroid, but showed poor improvement. Therefore, granulocyte and monocyte apheresis (GMA) treatment was administered in combination with prednisolone. After 3 months, the ulcer gradually improved, and at the time of this writing, the eruptions were nearly replaced by epithelial tissue. This case study showed that patients with UC and EIMS may respond well to combination therapy of VED and GMA. GMA has a very favorable safety profile. On the other hand, the causal connection between VED and PG is still unclear. We believe that a combination therapy involving VED and GMA in IBD patients with EIMs warrants consideration.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

  Abstract: Vagus nerve stimulation has shown promise in treating inflammatory bowel disease. A new study identifies a hepatic vagal branch pathway necessary to maintain colonic immune cell homeostasis in experimental colitis, challenging the dogma that an anti-inflammatory reflex requires an intact spleen and that α7-nicotinic receptor agonists are a panacea for inflammatory conditions.

  Title: Nutrition and Psoriasis.
  Abstract: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by accelerated tumor necrosis factor-α/interleukin-23/interleukin-17 axis, hyperproliferation and abnormal differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes. Psoriasis patients are frequently associated with obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular diseases, or inflammatory bowel diseases. Psoriasis patients often show unbalanced dietary habits such as higher intake of fat and lower intake of fish or dietary fibers, compared to controls. Such dietary habits might be related to the incidence and severity of psoriasis. Nutrition influences the development and progress of psoriasis and its comorbidities. Saturated fatty acids, simple sugars, red meat, or alcohol exacerbate psoriasis via the activation of nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeats containing family, pyrin domain-containing-3 inflammasome, tumor necrosis factor-α/interleukin-23/interleukin-17 pathway, reactive oxygen species, prostanoids/leukotrienes, gut dysbiosis or suppression of regulatory T cells, while n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin D, vitamin B12, short chain fatty acids, selenium, genistein, dietary fibers or probiotics ameliorate psoriasis via the suppression of inflammatory pathways above or induction of regulatory T cells. Psoriasis patients are associated with dysbiosis of gut microbiota and the deficiency of vitamin D or selenium. We herein present the update information regarding the stimulatory or regulatory effects of nutrients or food on psoriasis and the possible alleviation of psoriasis by nutritional strategies.

  Title: Clinical research linking Traditional Chinese Medicine constitution types with diseases: a literature review of 1639 observational studies.
  Abstract: To analyze clinical studies on correlations between Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) body constitution types and diseases published in the past 10 years, and to provide an evidence base to support the use of such correlations for health maintenance and disease prevention.We searched five databases for the period April 2009 to December 2019: China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, Wanfang Database, China Science and Technology Journal Database, PubMed and Embase. Three types of observational studies on correlation between constitution types and diseases were included: cross-sectional, case-control and cohort studies. Descriptive statistical methods were employed for data analysis.A total of 1639 clinical studies were identified: 1452 (88.59%) cross-sectional studies, 115 (7.02%) case-control studies and 72 (4.39%) cohort studies covering 30 regions of China and five other countries (Malaysia, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand and France). The collection of studies comprised 19 disease categories and 333 different diseases. The 10 most commonly studied diseases were hypertension, diabetes, stroke, coronary atherosclerotic heart disease (CAHD), sleep disorders, neoplasm of the breast, dysmenorrhea, fatty liver disease, chronic viral hepatitis B and dyslipidemia. We found high distributions for each biased constitution type in different patient populations as follows: Qi-deficiency constitution in stroke, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and hypertension; Yang-deficiency constitution in female infertility, osteoporosis, irritable bowel syndrome, gonarthrosis and dysmenorrhea; Yin-deficiency constitution in hypertension, diabetes, constipation, female climacteric states and osteoporosis; phlegm- dampness constitution in hypertension, stroke, fatty liver disease, diabetes and metabolic syndrome; damp-heat constitution in acne, chronic gastritis, chronic viral hepatitis B, human papillomavirus infection and hyperuricemia; blood-stasis constitution in CAHD, endometriosis and stroke; Qi-stagnation constitution in hyperplasia and neoplasms of the breast, insomnia, depression and thyroid nodules; and inherited-special constitution in asthma and allergic rhinitis.Eight biased TCM constitutions were closely related to specific diseases, and could be used to guide individualized prevention and treatment. More rigorously designed studies are recommended to further verify the constitution-disease relationship.

  Title: Comparative immunophenotyping of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida spp. strains from Crohn's disease patients and their interactions with the gut microbiome.
  Abstract: Investigation of the fungal communities in animal models of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) showed a controversial role of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida spp. In health and disease. These conflicting observations could be ascribed to immunogenic differences among co-specific strains. To assess the relevance of intra-strains differences on yeast immunogenicity and impact on the microbiota, we screened S. cerevisiae and Candida spp. Strains isolated from fecal samples of IBD patients. We compared the cytokine profiles, obtained upon stimulation of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) and Dendritic Cells with different yeast strains, and evaluated the relationship between strain's cell wall sugar amount and immune response. Moreover, the gut microbiota composition was explored in relation to fungal isolation from fecal samples by metabarcoding analysis. The comparison of cytokine profiles showed strain dependent rather than species-dependent differences in immune responses. Differences in immunogenicity correlated with the cell wall composition of S. cerevisiae intestinal strains. Stimulation of human healthy PBMCs with different strains showed a pro-inflammatory IL-6 response counterbalanced by IL-10 production. Interestingly, Crohn's (CD) patients responded differently to "self" and "non-self" strains, eliciting pure Th1 or Th17 cytokine patterns. The differences observed in vitro were recapitulated in vivo, where different strains contributed in dramatically different ways to local epithelial activity and to the inflammation of wild type and Interleukin-deficient mice. Furthermore, we observed that the gut microbiota profiles significantly differentiated according to the presence of Saccharomyces or Candida spp. or the absence of fungal isolates in fecal samples. Our results show the importance to deepen metagenomics and immunophenotyping analyses to the strain level, to elucidate the role of fungal and bacterial communities in health and disease.© 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

  Title: IRF5 Acts as a Potential Therapeutic Marker in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are chronic inflammatory disorders. As is well known, interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 5 is closely associated with the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases. But the exact role of IRF5 in IBD remains unclear.In this study, we detected IRF5 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and inflamed mucosa from IBD patients by immunohistochemistry, western blot, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Peripheral blood CD4+ T cells were stimulated with inflammatory cytokines and transfected by lentivirus.In active IBD patients, the expression of IRF5 in PBMCs and inflamed colonic tissues was obviously increased and significantly associated with disease activity. Ectopic overexpression of IRF5 could promote the differentiation of IBD CD4+ T cells into Th1 and Th17 cells by regulating T-bet and RAR related orphan receptor C, whereas knockdown of IRF5 had the opposite effects. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α upregulated expression of IRF5 in CD4+ T cells, but anti-TNF treatment with infliximab could markedly reduce IRF5 expression in CD4+ T cells and intestinal mucosa of CD patients.Our study reveals a novel mechanism that IRF5 levels are correlated with disease activity in IBD and might function as a possible marker for the management of IBD via regulating Th1 and Th17 immune responses and cytokine production.© 2020 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

  Title: Refractory Ulcerative Colitis Improved by Scheduled Combination Therapy of Vedolizumab and Granulocyte and Monocyte Adsorptive Apheresis.
  Abstract: Granulocyte and monocyte adsorptive apheresis (GMA) is occasionally introduced as an alternative combination therapy after loss of response to biologics in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. However, there have been no reports of the concomitant use of vedolizumab (VDZ) and GMA for the initial induction of UC. A 20-year-old man with refractory UC was admitted for recrudescence. VDZ monotherapy had previously been introduced but was ineffective. Therefore, he received scheduled combination of VDZ and GMA and achieved clinical remission. The combination of two different approaches to inhibit the migration of leukocytes into the inflamed tissue led to satisfactory clinical outcomes.

  Title: A single early-in-life antibiotic course increases susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis.
  Abstract: There is increasing evidence that the intestinal microbiota plays a crucial role in the maturation of the immune system and the prevention of diseases during childhood. Early-life short-course antibiotic use may affect the progression of subsequent disease conditions by changing both host microbiota and immunologic development. Epidemiologic studies provide evidence that early-life antibiotic exposures predispose to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).By using a murine model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, we evaluated the effect on disease outcomes of early-life pulsed antibiotic treatment (PAT) using tylosin, a macrolide and amoxicillin, a beta-lactam. We evaluated microbiota effects at the 16S rRNA gene level, and intestinal T cells by flow cytometry. Antibiotic-perturbed or control microbiota were transferred to pups that then were challenged with DSS.A single PAT course early-in-life exacerbated later DSS-induced colitis by both perturbing the microbial community and altering mucosal immune cell composition. By conventionalizing germ-free mice with either antibiotic-perturbed or control microbiota obtained 40 days after the challenge ended, we showed the transferrable and direct effect of the still-perturbed microbiota on colitis severity in the DSS model.The findings in this experimental model provide evidence that early-life microbiota perturbation may increase risk of colitis later in life.

  Title: A single early-in-life antibiotic course increases susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis.
  Abstract: There is increasing evidence that the intestinal microbiota plays a crucial role in the maturation of the immune system and the prevention of diseases during childhood. Early-life short-course antibiotic use may affect the progression of subsequent disease conditions by changing both host microbiota and immunologic development. Epidemiologic studies provide evidence that early-life antibiotic exposures predispose to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).By using a murine model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, we evaluated the effect on disease outcomes of early-life pulsed antibiotic treatment (PAT) using tylosin, a macrolide and amoxicillin, a beta-lactam. We evaluated microbiota effects at the 16S rRNA gene level, and intestinal T cells by flow cytometry. Antibiotic-perturbed or control microbiota were transferred to pups that then were challenged with DSS.A single PAT course early-in-life exacerbated later DSS-induced colitis by both perturbing the microbial community and altering mucosal immune cell composition. By conventionalizing germ-free mice with either antibiotic-perturbed or control microbiota obtained 40 days after the challenge ended, we showed the transferrable and direct effect of the still-perturbed microbiota on colitis severity in the DSS model.The findings in this experimental model provide evidence that early-life microbiota perturbation may increase risk of colitis later in life.

  Title: Anti-CXCL4 Antibody Reactivity Is Present in Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and Correlates with the SSc Type I Interferon Signature.
  Abstract: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is characterized by skin/internal organ fibrosis, vasculopathy and autoimmunity. Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 4 (CXCL4) is an SSc biomarker, predicting unfavorable prognosis and lung fibrosis. CXCL4 binds DNA/RNA and favors interferon (IFN)-α production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), contributing to the type I IFN (IFN-I) signature in SSc patients. However, whether CXCL4 is an autoantigen in SSc is unknown. Here, we show that at least half of SSc patients show consistent antibody reactivity to CXCL4. T-cell proliferation to CXCL4, tested in a limited number of patients, correlates with anti-CXCL4 antibody reactivity. Antibodies to CXCL4 mostly correlate with circulating IFN-α levels and are significantly higher in patients with lung fibrosis in two independent SSc cohorts. Antibodies to CXCL4 implement the CXCL4-DNA complex's effect on IFN-α production by pDCs; CXCL4-DNA/RNA complexes stimulate purified human B-cells to become antibody-secreting plasma cells in vitro. These data indicate that CXCL4 is indeed an autoantigen in SSc and suggest that CXCL4, and CXCL4-specific autoantibodies, can fuel a harmful loop: CXCL4-DNA/RNA complexes induce IFN-α in pDCs and direct B-cell stimulation, including the secretion of anti-CXCL4 antibodies. Anti-CXCL4 antibodies may further increase pDC stimulation and IFN-α release in vivo, creating a vicious cycle which sustains the SSc IFN-I signature and general inflammation.

  Title: Microbial Butyrate Synthesis Indicates Therapeutic Efficacy of Azathioprine in IBD Patients.
  Abstract: The microbial ecosystem seems to be an important player for therapeutic intervenption in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. We assessed longitudinal microbiome changes in IBD patients undergoing therapy with either azathioprine [AZA] or anti-tumour necrosis factor [anti-TNF] antibodies. We predicted the metabolic microbial community exchange and linked it to clinical outcome.Faecal and blood samples were collected from 65 IBD patients at baseline and after 12 and 30 weeks on therapy. Clinical remission was defined as Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] < 150 in Crohn´s disease [CD], partial Mayo score <2 in ulcerative colitis [UC], and faecal calprotectin values <150 µg/g and C-reactive protein <5 mg/dl. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was performed. To predict microbial community metabolic processes, we constructed multispecies genome-scale metabolic network models.Paired Bray-Curtis distance between baseline and follow-up time points was significantly different for UC patients treated with anti-TNF antibodies. Longitudinal changes in taxa composition at phylum level showed a significant decrease of Proteobacteria and an increase of Bacteroidetes in CD patients responding to both therapies. At family level, Lactobacilli were associated with persistent disease and Bacteroides abundance with remission in CD. In-silico simulations of microbial metabolite exchange predicted a 1.7-fold higher butyrate production capacity of patients in remission compared with patients without remission [p = 0.041]. In this model, the difference in butyrate production between patients in remission and patients without remission was most pronounced in the CD group treated with AZA [p = 0.008].In-silico simulation identifies microbial butyrate synthesis predictive of therapeutic efficacy in IBD.© The Author(s) 2020.

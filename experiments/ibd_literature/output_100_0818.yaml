  Title: The causal effect of inflammatory bowel disease on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: two-sample Mendelian randomization study.
  Keywords: Mendelian randomization (MR); diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL); genome-wide association studies (GWAS); inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
  PMID: 37593734
  Abstract: It has been reported that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an increased risk of malignancies, including lymphoma. A number of large observational studies have been devoted to exploring the causal link between IBD and malignant lymphoma. However, no consensus exists on whether there is a causal relationship between IBD and malignant lymphoma.The summary dataset of the IBD and lymphoma genome-wide association studies (GWAS) was obtained from the OPEN GWAS website. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected as genetic instrumental variants (IVs) for fulling P < 5 × 10-8 and linkage disequilibrium (LD) of r2 = 0.001 in the IBD GWAS. The proxy SNPs with LD of r2 > 0.8 were identified. Palindromic SNPs and outlier SNPs were excluded. The assessments of sensitivity employed the Cochran's Q test, Mendelian randomization (MR)-Egger intercept test, and leave-one-out analysis.The MR analysis results proved the causality of IBD on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The risk of developing DLBCL is increased by 28.6% in patients with IBD [odds ratio (OR)IVW = 1.286, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.066-1.552, P = 0.009]. The results of the subgroup analysis showed that Crohn's disease (ORIVW = 1.218, 95% CI 1.030-1.441, P = 0.021) rather than ulcerative colitis (ORIVW = 1.206, 95% CI 0.984-1.478, P = 0.072) had a causal effect on DLBCL. No horizontal and directional pleiotropy was observed in the MR studies.The above MR study concluded that IBD itself is causally responsible for DLBCL, especially Crohn's disease. Further investigations are needed to elucidate the mechanism underlying this direct causal link.Copyright © 2023 Lu, Chen, Tao, Xu, Li, Wang and Yu.

  Title: Growth Failure and Primary Amenorrhea: Endocrine Dysfunction as a Late Presentation of Crohn's Disease.
  Keywords: crohn’s disease; endocrine manifestations; growth failure; inflammatory bowel disease; primary amenorrhea
  PMID: 37593289
  Abstract: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease involving entire gastrointestinal tract, most commonly affecting terminal ileum and colon. It usually presents with gastrointestinal symptoms like bloody diarrhea, fever and loss of weight. The clinical course of CD includes gastrointestinal complications like fistulas, abscesses and perianal disease. Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are usually diagnosed during childhood and adolescence, majority during puberty and pubertal growth spurt. Various extraintestinal manifestations may be a presentation of CD that poses a diagnostic challenge. Growth failure is an important complication of IBD rather than a manifestation. Herein we present a case of a 16-year-old Sri Lankan girl presenting with growth failure and primary amenorrhea. She had minimal gastrointestinal symptoms. She also had microcytic anemia with marginally elevated inflammatory markers and hormonal profile. She underwent colonoscopy and was diagnosed to have Crohn's disease confirmed by ileal biopsy. On initiation of treatment with immunosuppressants, she attained menarche, although no improvement in height was observed.Copyright © 2023, Muthusamy et al.

  Title: Prevalence and Risk Factors of Anemia in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Case-Control Study.
  Keywords: anemia; crohn's disease; inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd); iron therapy; management; treatment; ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37593267
  Abstract: Introduction Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis may induce anemia, ranging from 25% to 75% depending on the study population and diagnostic criteria. It might negatively impact their health and quality of life. Objectives The aim of this work is to study the effectiveness and safety of treatments for anemia in patients with IBD. Methodology This case-control study compared patients with IBD who have anemia (cases; n=60) with patients who have IBD but do not have anemia (controls; n=60) from June 2019 to August 2021 in Hayatabad Medical Complex, Peshawar, Pakistan. Data were collected through interviews, from patients` medical records, and from lab test reports. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS, Version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results Cases had a greater mean age (45.2 years) than controls (42.8 years). Cases included 60% females and controls 45%. Also, cases earned less (p = 0.019). Anemic patients (group 1) had lower mean hemoglobin (10.2 g/dL) and iron than non-anemic controls (group 2) (p = 0.042 and 0.009, respectively). Anemia increased Crohn's Disease Activity Index and Mayo Score. Group 1 has iron deficiency anemia, whereas group 2 has chronic disease. Group 1 reacts rapidly, but gastrointestinal side effects, allergies, and iron overload are more prevalent. Conclusion IBD patients exhibited low hemoglobin and iron, suggesting anemia. Anemia increased disease activity, but not statistically. IBD patients need iron and anemia treatment. Comparing groups demonstrates differences in anemia types, iron replacement history, treatment response, and bad effects, proposing targeted iron supplementation for deficiency anemia and managing chronic illness factors for chronic disease anemia. IBD anemia treatment involves individualization.Copyright © 2023, Aslam et al.

  Title: A case series of appendicitis and pseudo-appendicitis in a paediatric intensive care unit.
  Keywords: appendicitis; critical care; diagnosis; pancreatitis; peritonitis; rupture
  PMID: 37592922
  Abstract: Appendicitis is a common childhood condition that can be diagnostically challenging. Severe cases may necessitate support in the critical or intensive care unit. These "critical appendicitis diagnoses" have rarely been described.We retrospective reviewed the PICU database of the Hong Kong Children's Hospital and identified cases of suspected and confirmed appendicitis. Clinical features, radiologic findings and final diagnosis of each case were summarized and reported in this case series. We review six anonymized cases of appendicitis managed in a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) to illustrate the different age spectrum and clinical manifestations of the condition. Rupture of the inflamed appendix, peritonitis and pancreatitis were some of the complications encountered. Crohn disease was found in one case as an underlying diagnosis. Also, one girl clinically diagnosed with appendicitis was found to be a case of ruptured hepatoblastoma with no appendicitis (i.e., pseudoappendicitis).Prompt diagnosis, surgical removal of the inflamed appendix, and use of appropriate antimicrobials when indicated are essential in reducing mortality and morbidity associated with severe appendicitis. Significant premorbid conditions such as acute myeloid leukemia, mitochondrial encephalopathy lactic acidosis syndrome (MELAS), inflammatory bowel disease and complications may be present in patients needing intensive care as is illustrated in the present cases. Pseudoappendicitis is an important differential diagnosis. Imaging is crucial and useful in establishing and confirming the diagnosis of appendicitis and pseudo-appendicitis in these PICU cases.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.

  Title: RORγt-Raftlin1 complex regulates the pathogenicity of Th17 cells and colonic inflammation.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37591835
  Abstract: Th17 cells that produce Interleukin IL-17 are pathogenic in many human diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, but are, paradoxically, essential for maintaining the integrity of the intestinal barrier in a non-inflammatory state. However, the intracellular mechanisms that regulate distinct transcriptional profiles and functional diversity of Th17 cells remain unclear. Here we show Raftlin1, a lipid raft protein, specifically upregulates and forms a complex with RORγt in pathogenic Th17 cells. Disruption of the RORγt-Raftlin1 complex results in the reduction of pathogenic Th17 cells in response to Citrobacter rodentium; however, there is no effect on nonpathogenic Th17 cells in response to commensal segmented filamentous bacteria. Mechanistically, we show that Raftlin1 recruits distinct phospholipids to RORγt and promotes the pathogenicity of Th17 cells. Thus, we have identified a mechanism that drives the pathogenic function of Th17 cells, which could provide a platform for advanced therapeutic strategies to dampen Th17-mediated inflammatory diseases.© 2023.

  Title: Exosomes-transferred LINC00668 Contributes to Thrombosis by Promoting NETs Formation in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Keywords: LINC00668; berberines; exosomes; inflammatory bowel diseases; neutrophil elastase; neutrophil extracellular traps; thrombus
  PMID: 37590310
  Abstract: Epidemiological studies show an association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and increased risk of thrombosis. However, how IBD influences thrombosis remains unknown. The current study shows that formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) significantly increased in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced IBD mice, which in turn, contributes to thrombus formation in a NETs-dependent fashion. Furthermore, the exosomes isolated from the plasma of the IBD mice induce arterial and venous thrombosis in vivo. Importantly, proinflammatory factors-exposed intestinal epithelial cells (inflamed IECs) promote neutrophils to release NETs through their secreted exosomes. RNA sequencing revealed that LINC00668 is highly enriched in the inflamed IECs-derived exosomes. Mechanistically, LINC00668 facilitates the translocation of neutrophil elastase (NE) from the cytoplasmic granules to the nucleus via its interaction with NE in a sequence-specific manner, thereby inducing NETs release and thrombus formation. Importantly, berberine (BBR) suppresses the nuclear translocation of NE and subsequent NETs formation by inhibiting the interaction of LINC00668 with NE, thus exerting its antithrombotic effects. This study provides a novel pathobiological mechanism linking IBD and thrombosis by exosome-mediated NETs formation. Targeting LINC00668 can serve as a novel molecular treatment strategy to treat IBD-related thrombosis.© 2023 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.

  Title: Therapeutic Effect of HDAC5 Binding and Cell Penetrating Peptide for the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Keywords: Anti-inflammatory agent; Cell-penetrating peptide; Histone deacetylase; Inflammatory bowel disease; Macrophage
  PMID: 37589886
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an incurable disease that negatively influences the quality of life of patients. Current and emerging therapies target proinflammatory cytokines and/or receptors to downregulate proinflammatory responses, but insufficient remission requires other therapeutic agents. Herein, we report that the synthetic anti-inflammatory peptide 15 (SAP15) is capable of cell penetration and anti-inflammatory activity in human macrophages.SAP15 was labeled with fluorescence and administered to human leukemia monocytic cells (THP-1) cells for cell penetration analysis. Using biolayer interferometry analysis, the binding affinity of SAP15 with histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) was measured. SAP15-treated THP-1 cells were analyzed by protein phosphorylation assay, flow cytometry, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, in vivo analysis of the therapeutic effect on IBD was observed in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced model. Samples from SAP15-treated mice were analyzed at both the macroscopic and microscopic levels using ELISA, myeloperoxidase (MPO) assays, and histological evaluations.SAP15 was internalized within the cytosol and nucleus of THP-1 cells and bound to the HDAC5 protein. SAP15-treated macrophages were assessed for protein phosphorylation and showed inhibited phosphorylation of HDAC5 and other immune-related proteins, which led to increased M2-like macrophage markers and decreased M1-like macrophage markers and tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 cytokine levels. The SAP15 treatment on IBD model showed significant recovery of colon length. Further histological analysis of colon demonstrated the therapeutic effect of SAP15 on mucosal layer. Moreover, proinflammatory cytokine levels and MPO activity from the plasma show that SAP15 is effective in reduced proinflammatory responses.These findings suggest that SAP15 is a novel peptide with a novel cell-penetrating peptide with anti-inflammatory property that can be used as a therapeutic agent for IBD and other inflammatory diseases.© 2023.

  Title: Bone health in inflammatory bowel disease.
  Keywords: Fracture; inflammatory bowel disease; osteopenia; osteoporosis; pediatric
  PMID: 37589220
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease characterized by the presence of systemic inflammation, manifesting not only as gastrointestinal symptoms but also as extraintestinal bone complications, including osteopenia and osteoporosis. However, the association between IBD and osteoporosis is complex, and the presence of multifactorial participants in the development of osteoporosis is increasingly recognized. Unlike in adults, delayed puberty and growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 axis abnormalities are essential risk factors for osteoporosis in pediatric patients with IBD.This article reviews the potential pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to osteoporosis in adult and pediatric patients with IBD and provides evidence for effective prevention and treatment, focusing on pediatric patients with IBD. A search was performed from PubMed and Web of Science inception to February 2023 to identify articles on IBD, osteoporosis, pediatric, and fracture risk.A comprehensive treatment pattern based on individualized principles can be used to manage pediatric IBD-related osteoporosis.

  Title: Dual pH and microbial-sensitive galactosylated polymeric nanocargoes for multi-level targeting to combat ulcerative colitis.
  Keywords: Galactosylated nanocargoes; Macrophage galactose type-lectin C; Microbial sensitive; Pullulan; Ulcerative colitis; pH-sensitive drug delivery
  PMID: 37588990
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease characterized by inflammation, ulcers and irritation of the mucosal lining. Oral drug delivery in UC encounters challenges because of multifaceted barriers. Dexamethasone-loaded galactosylated-PLGA/Eudragit S100/pullulan nanocargoes (Dexa-GP/ES/Pu NCs) have been developed with a dual stimuli-sensitive coating responsive to both colonic pH and microbiota, and an underneath galactosylated-PLGA core (GP). The galactose ligand of the GP preferentially binds to the macrophage galactose type-lectin-C (MGL-2) surface receptor. Therefore, both stimuli and ligand-mediated targeting facilitate nanocargoes to deliver Dexa specifically to the colon with enhanced macrophage uptake. Modified emulsion method coupled with a solvent evaporation coating technique was employed to prepare Dexa-GP/ES/Pu NCs. The nanocargoes were tested using in vitro, ex vivo techniques and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) induced UC model. Prepared nanocargoes had desired physicochemical properties, drug release, cell uptake and cellular viability. Investigations using a DSS-colitis model showed high localization and mitigation of colitis with downregulation of NF-ĸB and COX-2, and restoration of clinical, histopathological, biochemical indices, antioxidant balance, microbial alterations, FTIR spectra, and epithelial junctions' integrity. Thus, Dexa-GP/ES/Pu NCs found to be biocompatible nanocargoes capable of delivering drugs to the inflamed colon with unique targeting properties for prolonged duration.© 2023 Shenyang Pharmaceutical University.

  Title: Impact of Dietary Patterns in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Subtypes Versus Healthy Subjects: a Retrospective Cohort Study.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37588829
  Abstract: Objectives:Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have been associated with multiple environmental factors, including diet. A dietary pattern characterized by low fiber content, high fat content and high carbohydrate content has been linked to the development of IBD. The objective of the current investigation is to examine the potential link between dietary patterns and the occurrence of IBD and to investigate whether there are any differences in relation to the type of IBD and specific food groups. Material and methods:We conducted an observational retrospective comparative study using three cohorts: 89 Crohn's disease (CD) patients, 40 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and 64 healthy subjects. All participants underwent structured interviews and were required to complete a questionnaire regarding their dietary habits either prior to the onset of IBD or within the last year for control subjects. Results:A higher proportion of CD patients reported a higher rate of salt intake (71.9% vs. 53.1%, p-value = 0.043), sweetened beverages (38.2% vs. 17.2%, p-value=0.022), processed meat (66.3% vs. 40.6%, p-value=0.007), fatty meat (50.6% vs. 28.1%, p-value=0.021), fried foods (47.2% vs. 9.4%, p-value<0.001) and mayonnaise (21.3% vs. 6.2%, p-value=0.032) and a lower intake of nuts and seeds (20.2% vs. 43.8%, p-value=0.004) and yogurt (23.6% vs. 43.8%, p-value=0.030) compared to healthy subjects. Compared to controls, in the UC group there was a higher consumption of salt (85% vs. 53.1%, p-value=0.003), sweetened beverages (47.5% vs. 17.2%, p-value=0.005), fatty meat (55% vs. 28.1%, p-value=0.025) and fried foods (55% vs. 9.4%, p-value<0.001) and a lower intake of nuts and seeds (10% vs. 43.8%, p-value=0.001). Conclusion:Diet patterns before the onset of the disease are similar in patients with Crohn's disease and patients with ulcerative colitis: increased consumption of sweetened beverages, processed and fatty meat, fried food, salt, store-bought ice cream, and mayonnaise, and decreased intake of seeds, nuts, and yogurt.

  Title: Impact of Dietary Patterns in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Subtypes Versus Healthy Subjects: a Retrospective Cohort Study.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37588829
  Abstract: Objectives:Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have been associated with multiple environmental factors, including diet. A dietary pattern characterized by low fiber content, high fat content and high carbohydrate content has been linked to the development of IBD. The objective of the current investigation is to examine the potential link between dietary patterns and the occurrence of IBD and to investigate whether there are any differences in relation to the type of IBD and specific food groups. Material and methods:We conducted an observational retrospective comparative study using three cohorts: 89 Crohn's disease (CD) patients, 40 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and 64 healthy subjects. All participants underwent structured interviews and were required to complete a questionnaire regarding their dietary habits either prior to the onset of IBD or within the last year for control subjects. Results:A higher proportion of CD patients reported a higher rate of salt intake (71.9% vs. 53.1%, p-value = 0.043), sweetened beverages (38.2% vs. 17.2%, p-value=0.022), processed meat (66.3% vs. 40.6%, p-value=0.007), fatty meat (50.6% vs. 28.1%, p-value=0.021), fried foods (47.2% vs. 9.4%, p-value<0.001) and mayonnaise (21.3% vs. 6.2%, p-value=0.032) and a lower intake of nuts and seeds (20.2% vs. 43.8%, p-value=0.004) and yogurt (23.6% vs. 43.8%, p-value=0.030) compared to healthy subjects. Compared to controls, in the UC group there was a higher consumption of salt (85% vs. 53.1%, p-value=0.003), sweetened beverages (47.5% vs. 17.2%, p-value=0.005), fatty meat (55% vs. 28.1%, p-value=0.025) and fried foods (55% vs. 9.4%, p-value<0.001) and a lower intake of nuts and seeds (10% vs. 43.8%, p-value=0.001). Conclusion:Diet patterns before the onset of the disease are similar in patients with Crohn's disease and patients with ulcerative colitis: increased consumption of sweetened beverages, processed and fatty meat, fried food, salt, store-bought ice cream, and mayonnaise, and decreased intake of seeds, nuts, and yogurt.

  Title: Causality between inflammatory bowel disease and the cerebral cortex: insights from Mendelian randomization and integrated bioinformatics analysis.
  Keywords: Mendelian randomization; causality; cerebral cortex; inflammatory bowel disease; integrated bioinformatics
  PMID: 37588593
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is a chronic, progressive, and recurrent intestinal condition that poses a significant global health burden. The high prevalence of neuropsychiatric comorbidities in IBD necessitates the development of targeted management strategies.Leveraging genetic data from genome-wide association studies and Immunochip genotype analyses of nearly 150,000 individuals, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization study to elucidate the driving force of IBD, UC, and CD on cortical reshaping. Genetic variants mediating the causality were collected to disclose the biological pathways linking intestinal inflammation to brain dysfunction.Here, 115, 69, and 98 instrumental variables genetically predicted IBD, UC, and CD. We found that CD significantly decreased the surface area of the temporal pole gyrus (β = -0.946 mm2, P = 0.005, false discovery rate-P = 0.085). Additionally, we identified suggestive variations in cortical surface area and thickness induced by exposure across eight functional gyri. The top 10 variant-matched genes were STAT3, FOS, NFKB1, JAK2, STAT4, TYK2, SMAD3, IL12B, MYC, and CCL2, which are interconnected in the interaction network and play a role in inflammatory and immune processes.We explore the causality between intestinal inflammation and altered cortical morphology. It is likely that neuroinflammation-induced damage, impaired neurological function, and persistent nociceptive input lead to morphological changes in the cerebral cortex, which may trigger neuropsychiatric disorders.Copyright © 2023 He, Peng, Chen and Ou.

  Title: Surgical Treatment in Ulcerative Colitis, Still Topical: A Narrative Review.
  Keywords: colorectal cancer (crc); inflammatory bowel disease; laparascopic surgery; postoperative complications; preventive colectomy; surgical treatment; timing; total proctocolectomy; ulcerative colitis (uc); • open surgery
  PMID: 37588306
  Abstract: In this paper, different studies were integrated to conclude the impact of ulcerative colitis (UC) on the patient's vital prognosis, specifically highlighting the association with colorectal cancer (CRC). These severe complications have led us to consider studying the role of preventive surgery in managing UC. This study reviewed total preventive colectomy in UC patients for preventing the onset of CRC, the role of surgery in UC management, and its potential as a definitive treatment for the condition. The study also emphasized the effectiveness of annual colonoscopic monitoring and preventive colectomy in reducing the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). It discussed the role of laparoscopic surgery in minimizing postoperative complications and highlighted that partial surgical resection of the colon can be a viable option, offering improved bowel function without increasing the risk of CRC-related mortality. Elective surgery has an important place in UC management by preventing the development of forms requiring emergency surgery. Although surgery can cure UC, it can lead to significant postoperative complications and adverse effects.Copyright © 2023, Slonovschi et al.

  Title: Monogenic deficiency in murine intestinal Cdc42 leads to mucosal inflammation that induces crypt dysplasia.
  Keywords: Cell division cycle 42 (CDC42); Colitis; Colorectal cancer (CRC); Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD); Intestinal epithelial cell (IEC); Intestinal epithelial stem cell (IESC); Irradiation
  PMID: 37588188
  Abstract: CDC42 controls intestinal epithelial (IEC) stem cell (IESC) division. How aberrant CDC42 initiates intestinal inflammation or neoplasia is unclear. We utilized models of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), colorectal cancer, aging, and IESC injury to determine the loss of intestinal Cdc42 upon inflammation and neoplasia. Intestinal specimens were collected to determine the levels of CDC42 in IBD or colorectal cancer. Cdc42 floxed mice were crossed with Villin-Cre, Villin-CreERT2 and/or Lgr5-eGFP-IRES-CreERT2, or Bmi1-CreERT2 mice to generate Cdc42 deficient mice. Irradiation, colitis, aging, and intestinal organoid were used to evaluate CDC42 upon mucosal inflammation, IESC/progenitor regenerative capacity, and IEC repair. Our studies revealed that increased CDC42 in colorectal cancer correlated with lower survival; in contrast, lower levels of CDC42 were found in the inflamed IBD colon. Colonic Cdc42 depletion significantly reduced Lgr5+ IESCs, increased progenitors' hyperplasia, and induced mucosal inflammation, which led to crypt dysplasia. Colonic Cdc42 depletion markedly enhanced irradiation- or chemical-induced colitis. Depletion or inhibition of Cdc42 reduced colonic Lgr5+ IESC regeneration. In conclusion, depletion of Cdc42 reduces the IESC regeneration and IEC repair, leading to prolonged mucosal inflammation. Constitutive monogenic loss of Cdc42 induces mucosal inflammation, which could result in intestinal neoplasia in the context of aging.© 2023 The Authors.

  Title: Impaired Abcb1a function and red meat in a translational colitis mouse model induces inflammation and alters microbiota composition.
  Keywords: Abcb1; NETs; colon mucosa; diet; microbiota; neutrophil degranulation; p-glycoprotein; proteomics
  PMID: 37588005
  Abstract: Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) affects approximately 0.3% of the global population, with incidence rates rising dramatically worldwide. Emerging evidence points to an interplay between exposome factors such as diet and gut microbiota, host genetics, and the immune system as crucial elements in IBD development. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, including human p-glycoprotein encoded by the Abcb1 gene, influence intestinal inflammation, and their expression may interact with environmental factors such as diet and gut microbes. Our study aimed to examine the impact of protein sources on a genetic colitis mouse model.Abcb1a-deficient colitis mice were fed either casein or red meat-supplemented diets to investigate potential colitis-aggravating components in red meat and their effects on host-microbiota interactions. We conducted deep label free quantitative proteomic inflammation profiling of gastrointestinal tissue (colon, ileum) and urine, and determined the overall microbiome in feces using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Microbiota shifts by diet and protein transporter impairment were addressed by multivariate statistical analysis. Colon and systemic gut inflammation were validated through histology and immune assays, respectively.A quantitative discovery based proteomic analysis of intestinal tissue and urine revealed associations between ileum and urine proteomes in relation to Abcb1a deficiency. The absence of Abcb1a efflux pump function and diet-induced intestinal inflammation impacted multiple systemic immune processes, including extensive neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) components observed in relation to neutrophil degranulation throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The colitis model's microbiome differed significantly from that of wild-type mice, indicating the substantial influence of efflux transporter deficiency on microbiota.The proteomic and microbiota analyzes of a well-established murine model enabled the correlation of gastrointestinal interactions not readily identifiable in human cohorts. Insights into dysregulated biological pathways in this disease model might offer translational biomarkers based on NETs and improved understanding of IBD pathogenesis in human patients. Our findings demonstrate that drug transporter deficiency induces substantial changes in the microbiota, leading to increased levels of IBD-associated strains and resulting in intestinal inflammation.

  Title: Clinical characteristics and long-term prognosis of elderly onset Crohn's disease.
  Keywords: Crohn’s disease; aged; clinical characteristics; prognosis
  PMID: 37587070
  Abstract: With the increase in aging population in China, elderly Crohn's disease (CD) patients need to receive more attention. This study aims to explore the clinical characteristics and disease process of elderly onset CD (EOCD) patients in a single center.From January 2002 to January 2022, a total of 221 patients with CD from the Seventh Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital were enrolled. According to the Montreal CD classification standard, the patients were further divided into 4 groups: an EOCD group (≥60 years old, n=25), a middle age onset CD (MOCD) group (40-59 years old, n=46), a young onset CD (YOCD) group (17-40 years old, n=131), and a childhood onset CD (COCD) group (6-16 years old, n=19). We compared the clinical characteristics and long-term prognosis among them.Females were predominant in the EOCD group (15/25, 60%). The number of people without smoking in the EOCD group (80%) was lower than that in COCD group (100%), higher than that in the YOCD group (70.2%) and the MOCD group (69.6%) (all P<0.05). Patients with perianal diseases at diagnosis were rare in the EOCD group (0%), lower than that in the COCD group (21.1%) and the YOVD group (19.8%) (all P<0.05). Stenosis was the most common disease behavior in the EOCD group (63.0%), significantly higher than that in the COCD group (15.8%), the YOCD group (36.6%) and the MOCD group (43.5%) (all P<0.05). The EOCD group was easier to be misdiagnosed as tumor (24%), higher than that in the COCD group (0%), the YOCD group (6.9%) and the MOCD group (19.6%) (all P<0.05). The EOCD group was prone to comorbidities (52%), and 20% of them were complicated with multiple comorbidities (P<0.05). During the follow-up, the all-cause mortality of EOCD was 12%, and the CD-related mortality was 8%, which was significantly higher than the other groups (all P<0.05). The use of immunosuppressants in the EOCD group (4.8%) was lower than that in the COCD group (12.8%), the YOCD group (16.8%) and the MOCD group (16.1%), but there was no statistical significance among the 4 groups (P=0.467). In addition, there was no significant difference in the rate of intestinal resection among the 4 groups (P=0.062).In EOCD patients, females were predominant, smoking was less common, and they were prone to comorbidity. At the initial stage of diagnosis, it is easy to be misdiagnosed as tumor, and the disease behavior mainly showed stricture type, less complicated with perianal diseases. During the follow-up, all-cause mortality and CD-related mortality of EOCD patients were significantly higher than those of the non-elderly onset CD patients.

  Title: Clinical characteristics and long-term prognosis of elderly onset Crohn's disease.
  Keywords: Crohn’s disease; aged; clinical characteristics; prognosis
  PMID: 37587070
  Abstract: With the increase in aging population in China, elderly Crohn's disease (CD) patients need to receive more attention. This study aims to explore the clinical characteristics and disease process of elderly onset CD (EOCD) patients in a single center.From January 2002 to January 2022, a total of 221 patients with CD from the Seventh Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital were enrolled. According to the Montreal CD classification standard, the patients were further divided into 4 groups: an EOCD group (≥60 years old, n=25), a middle age onset CD (MOCD) group (40-59 years old, n=46), a young onset CD (YOCD) group (17-40 years old, n=131), and a childhood onset CD (COCD) group (6-16 years old, n=19). We compared the clinical characteristics and long-term prognosis among them.Females were predominant in the EOCD group (15/25, 60%). The number of people without smoking in the EOCD group (80%) was lower than that in COCD group (100%), higher than that in the YOCD group (70.2%) and the MOCD group (69.6%) (all P<0.05). Patients with perianal diseases at diagnosis were rare in the EOCD group (0%), lower than that in the COCD group (21.1%) and the YOVD group (19.8%) (all P<0.05). Stenosis was the most common disease behavior in the EOCD group (63.0%), significantly higher than that in the COCD group (15.8%), the YOCD group (36.6%) and the MOCD group (43.5%) (all P<0.05). The EOCD group was easier to be misdiagnosed as tumor (24%), higher than that in the COCD group (0%), the YOCD group (6.9%) and the MOCD group (19.6%) (all P<0.05). The EOCD group was prone to comorbidities (52%), and 20% of them were complicated with multiple comorbidities (P<0.05). During the follow-up, the all-cause mortality of EOCD was 12%, and the CD-related mortality was 8%, which was significantly higher than the other groups (all P<0.05). The use of immunosuppressants in the EOCD group (4.8%) was lower than that in the COCD group (12.8%), the YOCD group (16.8%) and the MOCD group (16.1%), but there was no statistical significance among the 4 groups (P=0.467). In addition, there was no significant difference in the rate of intestinal resection among the 4 groups (P=0.062).In EOCD patients, females were predominant, smoking was less common, and they were prone to comorbidity. At the initial stage of diagnosis, it is easy to be misdiagnosed as tumor, and the disease behavior mainly showed stricture type, less complicated with perianal diseases. During the follow-up, all-cause mortality and CD-related mortality of EOCD patients were significantly higher than those of the non-elderly onset CD patients.

  Title: Administration of Intestinal Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Reduces Colitis-Associated Cancer in C57BL/6J mice modulating the immune response and gut dysbiosis.
  Keywords: DSS colitis; Mesenchymal stromal cells; azoxymethane; cell therapy; colorectal cancer; dysbiosis; inflammation; intestinal microbiota
  PMID: 37586618
  Abstract: Patients with Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have a higher risk of developing colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) with poor prognosis. IBD etiology remains undefined but involves environmental factors, genetic predisposition, microbiota imbalance (dysbiosis) and mucosal immune defects. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) injections have shown good efficacy in reducing intestinal inflammation in animal and human studies. However, their effect on tumor growth in CAC and their capacity to restore gut dysbiosis is not clear.The outcome of systemic administrations of in vitro expanded human intestinal MSCs (iMSCs) on tumor growth in vivo was evaluated using the AOM/DSS model of CAC in C57BL/6J mice. Innate and adaptive immune responses in blood, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and colonic tissue were analyzed by flow cytometry. Intestinal microbiota composition was evaluated by 16S rRNA Amplicon Sequencing.iMSCs significantly inhibited colitis and intestinal tumor development, reducing IL-6 and COX-2 expression, and IL-6/STAT3 and PI3K/Akt signaling. iMSCs decreased colonic immune cell infiltration, and partly restored intestinal monocyte homing and differentiation. iMSC administration increased the numbers of Tregs and IFN-γ+CD8+ T cells in the MLNs while decreasing the IL-4+Th2 response. It also ameliorated intestinal dysbiosis in CAC mice, increasing diversity and Bacillota/Bacteroidota ratio, as well as Akkermansia abundance, while reducing Alistipes and Turicibacter, genera associated with inflammation.Administration of iMSCs protects against CAC, ameliorating colitis and partially reverting intestinal dysbiosis, supporting the use of MSCs for the treatment of IBD.Copyright © 2023.

  Title: Commensal bacteria promote azathioprine therapy failure in inflammatory bowel disease via decreasing 6-mercaptopurine bioavailability.
  Keywords: 6-mercaptopurine; azathioprine therapy failure; biotransformation; inflammatory bowel disease; microbiome
  PMID: 37586320
  Abstract: Azathioprine (AZA) therapy failure, though not the primary cause, contributes to disease relapse and progression in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the role of gut microbiota in AZA therapy failure remains poorly understood. We found a high prevalence of Blautia wexlerae in patients with IBD with AZA therapy failure, associated with shorter disease flare survival time. Colonization of B. wexlerae increased inflammatory macrophages and compromised AZA's therapeutic efficacy in mice with intestinal colitis. B. wexlerae colonization reduced 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) bioavailability by enhancing selenium-dependent xanthine dehydrogenase (sd-XDH) activity. The enzyme sd-XDH converts 6-MP into its inactive metabolite, 6-thioxanthine (6-TX), thereby impairing its ability to inhibit inflammation in mice. Supplementation with Bacillus (B.) subtilis enriched in hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) effectively mitigated B. wexlerae-induced AZA treatment failure in mice with intestinal colitis. These findings emphasize the need for tailored management strategies based on B. wexlerae levels in patients with IBD.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

  Title: Defining Comprehensive Disease Control for use as a Treatment Target for Ulcerative Colitis in Clinical Practice: International Delphi Consensus Recommendations.
  Keywords: Delphi consensus; Ulcerative colitis; patient-reported symptoms; remission
  PMID: 37586038
  Abstract: Treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) requires a patient-centric, definition of comprehensive disease control that considers improvements in aspects not typically captured by classical landmark trial endpoints. In an international initiative we reviewed aspects of UC that affect patients and/or indicate mucosal inflammation, to achieve consensus on which aspects to combine in a definition of comprehensive disease control, using a modified Delphi process.The Delphi panel comprised 12 gastroenterologists and one patient advocate. Two gastroenterologists were elected as chairs and did not vote. To inform statements, we asked 18 patients and the panel members about their experiences of remission and reviewed published literature. Panel members voted on statements anonymously in three rounds, with a live discussion before round 3. Consensus was met if ≥ 67% of the panel agreed. Statements without consensus in rounds 1 and 2 were revised or discarded after round 3.The panel agreed to measure individual patient benefit using a definition of comprehensive disease control that combines aspects currently measured in trials (rectal bleeding, stool frequency, disease-related quality of life, endoscopy, histological inflammatory activity, inflammatory biomarkers, and corticosteroid use), with additional patient-reported symptoms (bowel urgency, abdominal pain, extraintestinal manifestations, fatigue, and sleep disturbance). The panel agreed on scoring systems and thresholds for many aspects.Using a robust methodology, we defined comprehensive disease control in UC. Next, we will combine the measurement and scoring of these aspects into a multi-component tool and adopt comprehensive disease control as a treatment target in clinical practice and trials.© The Author(s) 2023.

  Title: Prevalence of skin lesions in a sample of Brazilian patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37585986
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel diseases may have extra intestinal manifestations such as those affecting the skin. This study aimed to study skin manifestations in a cohort of Brazilian patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.Epidemiological and clinical data were obtained through a cross-sectional study of 70 inflammatory bowel diseases patients and a control group comprising 50 healthy individuals. All patients were subjected to dermatological examination and photography of skin lesions.Out of the 70 inflammatory bowel diseases patients, 50 had ulcerative colitis and 20 had Crohn's disease. Skin lesions occurred in 95.7% of the inflammatory bowel diseases patients and in 88% of individuals in the control group (p=0.001). Alopecia (p<0.0001), xerosis (p=0.03), striae (p=0.02), and acne (p=0.04) were more common in inflammatory bowel diseases patients than in the control group. Alopecia was more frequent in females (p=0.01) than in males. Two male patients, one with ulcerative colitis and the other with Crohn's disease, had pyoderma gangrenosum. Erythema nodosum was not observed in both groups.There was a high prevalence of skin lesions in the Brazilian inflammatory bowel diseases patients. Additionally, alopecia, xerosis, striae, and acne were more common in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases than in those in the control group.

  Title: Maximizing Training and Mentorship in Sex as a Biological Variable Research Across Different Brain-Body Disorders.
  Keywords: brain-gut; irritable bowel syndrome; mentorship; microbiome; sex differences
  PMID: 37585513
  Abstract: The Specialized Center of Research Excellence (SCORE) on sex differences at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) has a long track record studying bidirectional interactions between different organs and the brain in health and disease with a strong focus on sex as a biological variable (SABV). While the initial focus was on brain-gut interactions in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), one of the most common disorders of gut-brain interaction, the scope of our Center's research has expanded to a range of different diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, alcohol use disorder, obesity, urological chronic pelvic pain syndrome, and vulvodynia. This expansion of research focused on the role of brain-body and brain-gut microbiome interactions in these various disorders, aligning well with the increasing importance of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary team science. The SCORE's Career Enhancement Core (CEC) has modeled team science as applied to SABV research, with educational and training opportunities, a mentoring program, seed grant funding, and other career development experiences that enable mentees to work across the disciplines involved in brain body research. The CEC goals are: (1) To provide seed grant funds for innovative research relevant to the overall SCORE mission and research program; (2) to recruit and foster the career development of students, trainees, and junior investigators who conduct research focused on sex differences or women's health in IBS and chronic constipation and other brain-gut disorders; (3) to facilitate and promote collaboration between the UCLA SCORE and other academic programs involved in women's health education and research; and (4) to promote the importance of SABV through community outreach using collaborative and innovative approaches. These goals focus on establishing the leading research center in sex differences in basic, translational, and clinical aspects of brain-body interactions and on providing women and underrepresented individuals with research opportunities needed to become independent investigators.

  Title: Identification of Novel Quinolin-2(1H)-ones as Phosphodiesterase 1 Inhibitors for the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37584424
  Abstract: Phosphodiesterase 1 (PDE1) is a subfamily of PDE super enzyme families that can hydrolyze cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate simultaneously. Currently, the number of PDE1 inhibitors is relatively few, significantly limiting their application. Herein, a novel series of quinolin-2(1H)-ones were designed rationally, leading to compound 10c with an IC50 of 15 nM against PDE1C, high selectivity across other PDEs, and remarkable safety properties. Furthermore, we used the lead compound 10c as a chemical tool to explore whether PDE1 could work as a novel potential target for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a disease which is a chronic, relapsing disorder of the gastrointestinal tract inflammation lacking effective treatment. Our results showed that administration of 10c exerted significant anti-IBD effects in the dextran sodium sulfate-induced mice model and alleviated the inflammatory response, indicating that PDE1 could work as a potent target for IBD.

  Title: Identification of Novel Quinolin-2(1H)-ones as Phosphodiesterase 1 Inhibitors for the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37584424
  Abstract: Phosphodiesterase 1 (PDE1) is a subfamily of PDE super enzyme families that can hydrolyze cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate simultaneously. Currently, the number of PDE1 inhibitors is relatively few, significantly limiting their application. Herein, a novel series of quinolin-2(1H)-ones were designed rationally, leading to compound 10c with an IC50 of 15 nM against PDE1C, high selectivity across other PDEs, and remarkable safety properties. Furthermore, we used the lead compound 10c as a chemical tool to explore whether PDE1 could work as a novel potential target for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a disease which is a chronic, relapsing disorder of the gastrointestinal tract inflammation lacking effective treatment.

  Title: Thiopurines have sustained long-term effectiveness in patients with inflammatory bowel disease which is independent of disease duration at initiation: A propensity score matched analysis.
  Keywords: Crohn’s disease; Disease course; Early Thiopurines; Effectiveness; Inflammatory Bowel Disease; Ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37584328
  Abstract: Thiopurines are viable option for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in resource limited countries. However, data on the effect of disease duration at thiopurines initiation on long-term effectiveness is limited.We performed a propensity matched analysis of a retrospective cohort of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Patients initiated on thiopurines early in the disease course (≤2 years) were compared to those started late (>2 years). Effectiveness defined as no requirement for hospitalization, anti-TNF agents, surgery, and minimum steroid requirement (≤ 1 steroid course in 2years) during follow-up.Nine-hundred eighty-eight (UC:720, CD:268) patients were included [(male: 665 (60.8%), median age: 40(32-51) years, median follow up: 40 (19-81) months]. Overall effectiveness at 5 and 10 years was 79% and 72% in UC, and 69% and 63% in CD respectively. After propensity score matching, there was no difference in 5- and 10-year effectiveness between early and late thiopurine initiation groups either for UC (81% and 80% vs. 82% and 74%; p=0.92) or CD (76% and 66% vs. 72% and 51%, p=0.32). Male sex for UC (negative: HR:0.67, 95% CI:0.45-0.97; p=0.03), and ileal involvement (positive: HR: 3.03, 95% CI:1.32-6.71; p= 0.008), steroid dependent disease (positive: HR: 2.70, 95% CI:1.26-5.68; p= 0.01) and adverse events (negative: HR: 0.47, 95%CI:0.27-0.80; p=0.005) for CD were predictors of thiopurine effectiveness.Thiopurines have sustained long-term effectiveness in both UC and CD. However, early thiopurine initiation had no better effect on long-term disease outcome compared to late initiation.© The Author(s) 2023.

  Title: Manipulation of the intestinal microbiome-a slow journey to primetime.
  Keywords: Clostridoides difficile; Fecal microbiota transplantation; Gut microbiota; Inflammatory bowel disease; Irritable bowel syndrome; Metabolic associated fatty liver disease
  PMID: 37583860
  Abstract: The gut microbiota has important functions in the regulation of normal body functions. Alterations of the microbiota are being increasingly linked to various disease states. The microbiome has been manipulated via the administration of stool from animals or humans, for more than 1000 years. Currently, fecal microbiota transplantation can be performed via endoscopic administration of fecal matter to the duodenum or colon or via capsules of lyophilized stools. More recently fecal microbial transplantation has been shown to be very effective for recurrent Clostridoides difficile infection (CDI). In addition there is some evidence of efficacy in the metabolic syndrome and its hepatic manifestation, metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We review the current literature regarding the microbiome and the pathogenesis and treatment of CDI, MAFLD, IBS and IBD.©The Author(s) 2023. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

  Title: IAPs and RIPK1 mediate LPS-induced cytokine production in healthy subjects and Crohn's disease.
  Keywords: Crohn’s disease; Human monocyte activation; Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP); Lipopolysaccharide (LPS); Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1)
  PMID: 37583360
  Abstract: Innate immune activity fuels intestinal inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD), an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Identification and targeting of new molecular regulators of the innate activity are warranted to control the disease. Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) regulate both cell survival and inflammatory signaling. We investigated effects of IAP inhibition by second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC) mimetics (SMs) on innate responses and cell death to pathogen-associated molecular patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and monocytes. IAPs inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of proinflammatory interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6. Likewise, LPS (but not muramyl dipeptide or E. coli) induced TNF-α was inhibited in CD and control PBMCs. The SM effect was partially reversed by inhibition of receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1). The effect was mainly cell death independent. Thus, IAP inhibition by SMs leads to reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines and may be considered in the efforts to develop new therapeutic strategies to control CD.© The Author(s) 2023.

  Title: Building a trustworthy AI differential diagnosis application for Crohn's disease and intestinal tuberculosis.
  Keywords: Crohn’s disease; Integrated gradients; Intestinal tuberculosis; Knowledge distillation; Neural network
  PMID: 37582768
  Abstract: Differentiating between Crohn's disease (CD) and intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) with endoscopy is challenging. We aim to perform more accurate endoscopic diagnosis between CD and ITB by building a trustworthy AI differential diagnosis application.A total of 1271 electronic health record (EHR) patients who had undergone colonoscopies at Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) and were clinically diagnosed with CD (n = 875) or ITB (n = 396) were used in this study. We build a workflow to make diagnoses with EHRs and mine differential diagnosis features; this involves finetuning the pretrained language models, distilling them into a light and efficient TextCNN model, interpreting the neural network and selecting differential attribution features, and then adopting manual feature checking and carrying out debias training.The accuracy of debiased TextCNN on differential diagnosis between CD and ITB is 0.83 (CR F1: 0.87, ITB F1: 0.77), which is the best among the baselines. On the noisy validation set, its accuracy was 0.70 (CR F1: 0.87, ITB: 0.69), which was significantly higher than that of models without debias. We also find that the debiased model more easily mines the diagnostically significant features. The debiased TextCNN unearthed 39 diagnostic features in the form of phrases, 17 of which were key diagnostic features recognized by the guidelines.We build a trustworthy AI differential diagnosis application for differentiating between CD and ITB focusing on accuracy, interpretability and robustness. The classifiers perform well, and the features which had statistical significance were in agreement with clinical guidelines.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

  Title: [Subcutaneous administration of levothyroxine in refractory hypothyroidism].
  Keywords: hypothyroidism; levothyroxine; malabsorption syndromes; thyroid neoplasms
  PMID: 37582137
  Abstract: Hypothyroidism can usually be treated effectively with oral levothyroxine (LT-4) supplementation. However, hypothyroidism refractory to treatment with LT-4 is a common clinical condition. Causes include poor compliance, interactions with food or other medications, and gastrointestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease and short bowel syndromes. Increasing the oral dose of LT-4 is not always effective in these scenarios. Therefore, other routes of administration may be necessary. In this report, we evaluate alternative treatment modalities for refractory hypothyroidism and present two patients with intestinal malabsorption successfully treated by subcutaneous administration of LT-4.

  Abstract: Hypothyroidism can usually be treated effectively with oral levothyroxine (LT-4) supplementation. However, hypothyroidism refractory to treatment with LT-4 is a common clinical condition. Causes include poor compliance, interactions with food or other medications, and gastrointestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease and short bowel syndromes. Increasing the oral dose of LT-4 is not always effective in these scenarios. Therefore, other routes of administration may be necessary. In this report, we evaluate alternative treatment modalities for refractory hypothyroidism and present two patients with intestinal malabsorption successfully treated by subcutaneous administration of LT-4.

  Title: DNASE1L3 enhances antitumor immunity and suppresses tumor progression in colon cancer.
  Keywords: Colorectal cancer; Dendritic cells; Inflammatory bowel disease; Oncology
  PMID: 37581941
  Abstract: DNASE1L3, an enzyme highly expressed in dendritic cells, is functionally important for regulating autoimmune responses to self-DNA and chromatin. Deficiency of DNASE1L3 leads to development of autoimmune diseases in both humans and mice. However, despite the well-established causal relationship between DNASE1L3 and immunity, little is known about the involvement of DNASE1L3 in regulation of anti-tumor immunity, the foundation of modern anti-tumor immunotherapy. In this study, we identify DNASE1L3 as a new regulator of anti-tumor immunity and a tumor suppressor in colon cancer. In humans, DNASE1L3 is downregulated in tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells, and this downregulation is associated with poor patient prognosis and reduced tumor immune cell infiltration in many cancer types. In mice, Dnase1l3 deficiency in the tumor microenvironment enhances tumor formation and growth in several colon cancer models. Notably, the increased tumor formation and growth in Dnase1l3-deficient mice are associated with impaired anti-tumor immunity, including a substantial reduction of cytotoxic T cells and a unique subset of dendritic cells. Consistently, Dnase1l3-deficient dendritic cells directly modulate cytotoxic T cells in vitro. Collectively, our study unveils a previously unknown link between DNASE1L3 and anti-tumor immunity, and further suggests that restoration of DNASE1L3 activity may represent a potential therapeutic approach for anti-cancer therapy.

  Title: Zinc-Rutin Particles Ameliorate DSS-Induced Acute and Chronic Colitis via Anti-inflammatory and Antioxidant Protection of the Intestinal Epithelial Barrier.
  Keywords: antioxidant, anti-inflammation; flavonoids; inflammatory bowel diseases; zinc ions
  PMID: 37581468
  Abstract: In patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), the immune system is disrupted and the intestinal barrier function is compromised. Here, six zinc-flavonoid particles were produced by one-step reaction via changing flavonoids (myricetin, quercetin, and rutin) and solvent (water and ethanol), and then their cytocompatibility and ability to scavenge H2O2, free radicals, and LPS-induced ROS were compared. Zinc-rutin particles (W-ZnRT) composed of rutin (78.92 wt %), Na12[ZnPO4]12·12H2O (6.76 wt %), and crystal water were screened out because W-ZnRT exhibited 80.8 ± 15% cell viability against RAW264.7, could rapidly scavenge 78.1 ± 1% of H2O2 and 71.6 ± 2% of DPPH within 30 min, and reduced LPS-increased intracellular ROS to normal levels. In addition, the therapeutic effects of rutin and W-ZnRT were also compared in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced acute and chronic colitis in mice. W-ZnRT was superior to rutin alone in chronic colitis (n = 9), although they were equally effective in acute colitis (n = 7). Compared to rutin, 11 oral doses of W-ZnRT (40 mg kg-1) significantly improved intestinal permeability (p = 0.0299) and colon length (p = 0.0025), reduced intestinal proinflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α), and upregulated tight junction proteins to maintain intestinal barrier function. Taken together, these results identified W-ZnRT as an efficient and safe therapeutic strategy for IBD.

  Title: Establishing key performance indicators for inflammatory bowel disease in the UK.
  Keywords: Inflammatory bowel disease
  PMID: 37581184
  Abstract: Healthcare quality improvement (QI) is the systematic process to continuously improve the quality of care and outcomes for patients. The landmark Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) UK National Audits provided a means to measure the variation in care, highlighting the need to define the standards of excellence in IBD care. Through a consensus approach, we aimed to establish key performance indicators (KPIs), providing reliable benchmarks for IBD care delivery in UK.KPIs that measure critical aspects of a patient journey within an IBD service were identified though stakeholder meetings. A two-stage Delphi consensus was then conducted. The first involved a multidisciplinary team of IBD clinicians and patients to refine definitions and methodology. The second stage assessed feasibility and utility of the proposed QI process by surveying gastroenterology services across UK.First, the four proposed KPIs were refined and included time from primary care referral to diagnosis in secondary care, time to treatment recommendation following a diagnosis, appropriate use of steroids and advanced therapies prescreening and assessment. Second, the Delphi consensus reported >85% agreement on the feasibility of local adoption of the QI process and >75% agreement on the utility of benchmarking of the KPIs.Through a structured approach, we propose quantifiable KPIs for benchmarking to improve and reduce the individual variation in IBD care across the UK.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

  Title: Feasibility of in vivo magnetic resonance elastography of mesenteric adipose tissue in Crohn's disease.
  Keywords: Crohn’s disease (CD); Inflammatory bowel disease; magnetic resonance elastography (MRE); magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT)
  PMID: 37581033
  Abstract: Although there is growing evidence that functional involvement and structural changes of mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT) influence the course of Crohn's disease (CD), its viscoelastic properties remain elusive. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the viscoelastic properties of MAT in CD using magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), providing reference values for CD diagnosis.In this prospective proof-of-concept study, 31 subjects (CD: n=11; healthy controls: n=20) were consecutively enrolled in a specialized care center for inflammatory bowel diseases (tertiary/quaternary care). Inclusion criteria for the CD patients were a clinically and endoscopically established diagnosis of CD based on the clinical record, absence of other concurrent bowel diseases, scheduled surgery for the following day, and age of at least 18 years. Diagnoses were confirmed by histological analysis of the resected bowel the day after MRE. Subjects were investigated using MRE at 1.5-T with frequencies of 40-70 Hz. To retrieve shear wave speed (SWS), volumes of interest (VOIs) in MAT were drawn adjacent to CD lesions (MATCD) and on the opposite side without adjacent bowel lesions in patients (MATCD_Opp) and controls (MATCTRL). The presented study is not registered in the clinical trial platform.A statistically significant decrease in mean SWS of 7% was found for MATCD_Opp vs. MATCTRL (0.76±0.05 vs. 0.82±0.04 m/s, P=0.012), whereas there was a nonsignificant trend with an 8% increase for MATCD vs. MATCD_Opp (0.82±0.07 vs. 0.76±0.05 m/s, P=0.098) and no difference for MATCD vs. MATCTRL. Preliminary area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis showed diagnostic accuracy in detecting CD to be excellent for SWS of MATCD_Opp [AUC =0.82; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.64-0.96] but poor for SWS of MATCD (AUC =0.52; 95% CI: 0.34-0.73).This study demonstrates the feasibility of MRE of MAT and presents preliminary reference values for CD patients and healthy controls. Our results motivate further studies for the biophysical characterization of MAT in inflammatory bowel disease.2023 Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery. All rights reserved.

  Title: Recalcitrant Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Clinical Burden and Unmet Needs.
  Keywords: biologics; pyoderma gangrenosum; recalcitrant; refractory; resistant
  PMID: 37581011
  Abstract: Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare, autoinflammatory disease leading to aseptic ulcers which carries a significant disease burden and is often difficult to treat, with many patients failing first-line treatment and requiring additional therapies. Such cases are typically referred to in the literature as "recalcitrant", "refractory", or "resistant", though little is known about the clinical characteristics of such cases. We performed a narrative literature review to characterize patient demographics and clinical course associated with difficult to treat pyoderma gangrenosum cases in order to identify trends to guide future clinical management and therapeutic innovation. We identified 148 cases with clinical manifestations and associated patient demographics stratified by ulcer and patient features. Consistent with previous work, a greater prevalence of PG was observed among female patients and those with a history of inflammatory bowel disease, however interestingly despite an aggressive course to their PG, few patients had comorbidities complicating their disease course. Additionally, despite the requirement of three or more treatments for most patients' disease to resolve, the majority healed within the typical window observed in previous clinical studies with low rates of recurrence. Biologics were the most common medication patients were on at time of remission. Collectively, our results suggest a potential benefit for a reduced threshold for biologic initiation in PG patients and a need for standardization of language in the field to facilitate treatment outcomes comparisons and interventions.© 2023 Becker et al.

  Title: The Impact of Cannabis Use on Clinical Outcomes in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Population-based Longitudinal Cohort Study.
  Keywords: Crohn’s disease; cannabis; inflammatory bowel disease; ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37580878
  Abstract: Cannabis use is common in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Recent studies demonstrated that use of cannabis may relieve symptoms; however, it is still unclear how safe cannabis and its derivatives are for IBD patients. We performed this study to evaluate the impact of cannabis use on several key clinical outcomes in IBD.We performed a retrospective study using the TriNetX Diamond Network. Cannabis use and noncannabis use subcohorts were identified for 3 patient groups: (1) IBD, (2) Crohn's disease (CD), and (3) ulcerative colitis (UC). Baseline differences between subcohorts for each group were controlled by propensity score matching. In each group, we compared relative incidence of emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalization, corticosteroid use, opioid use, IBD-related surgery, and death between cannabis users and noncannabis users.Inflammatory bowel disease cannabis users demonstrated an increased risk for corticosteroid use (risk ratios [R],1.095; 95% CI, 1.021-1.174; P = .011), ED visits (RR, 2.143; 95% CI, 2.034-2.257; P < .001), hospitalizations (RR, 1.925; 95% CI, 1.783-2.079; P < .001) and opioid use (RR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.14-1.6); P < .001), but not an increased risk of IBD-related surgery or death. The CD and UC groups exhibited similar outcomes, except only CD demonstrated an increased risk for corticosteroid and opioid use.Cannabis use in IBD patients is associated with several poor clinical outcomes, including increased risk of corticosteroid and opioid use, ED visits and hospitalization, though not IBD-related surgery or death. It is not clear what drives these risks or whether they are directly related to IBD-associated disease activity or other factors. Further prospective studies are warranted to more carefully investigate these relationships.© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

  Title: Adherence to ECCO Guidelines for Management of Iron Deficiency and Anemia in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Among Israeli Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37580868
  Abstract: The consensus guidelines of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) for the diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency anemia (IDA), were published in 2015. We examined the management practices of both adult gastroenterologists (AGs) and pediatric gastroenterologists (PGs) in Israel in treating ID among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).An 18-question multiple-choice anonymous questionnaire was electronically delivered to AGs and APs. Questions explored three areas of interest: physician demographics, adherence to ECCO guidelines, and management practices of IDA in patients with IBD.Completed questionnaires were returned by 72 AGs and 89 PGs. Practice setting and years of practice were similar. A large majority of AGs and PGs (89% and 92%, respectively) measure complete blood count (CBC) and serum ferritin (S-Fr) at least every three months in outpatients with active IBD, as recommended by the ECCO guidelines. In contrast, in IBD patients in remission, only 53% and 26% of AGs and PGs, respectively (p<0.001), reported adherence to ECCO guidelines, measuring CBC and S-Fr every six months. The ECCO treatment guidelines recommend that intravenous (IV) iron should be considered the first-line treatment in patients with clinically active IBD, with previous oral iron intolerance and those with a hemoglobin level <10g/dL. Study results indicate that only 43% of AGs recommend IV iron for these indications, compared to 54% of PGs (p>0.1).In this study we have demonstrated a relatively low level of adherence to ECCO guideline recommendations among both AGs and PGs, regarding the management of IDA in patients with IBD.Copyright © 2023 by European Society for European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition and North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition.

  Title: Inhibition of GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis triggered by Trichinella spiralis intervention contributes to the alleviation of DSS-induced ulcerative colitis in mice.
  Keywords: GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis; Inhibition; Protective effect; Trichinella spiralis; Ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37580819
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is increasing worldwide. Although there is currently no completely curative treatment, helminthic therapy shows certain therapeutic potential for UC. Many studies have found that Trichinella spiralis (T.s) has a protective effect on UC, but the specific mechanism is still unclear.Balb/c mice drank dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to induce acute colitis and then were treated with T.s. In vitro experiments, the LPS combination with ATP was used to induce the pyroptosis model, followed by intervention with crude protein from T.s (T.s cp). Additionally, the pyroptosis agonist of NSC or the pyroptosis inhibitor vx-765 was added to intervene to explore the role of pyroptosis in DSS-induced acute colitis. The degree of pyroptosis was evaluated by western blot, qPCR and IHC, etc., in vivo and in vitro.T.s intervention significantly inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation and GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis by downregulating the expression of pyroptosis-related signatures in vitro (cellular inflammatory model) and in vivo (DSS-induced UC mice model). Furthermore, blockade of GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis by the caspase-1 inhibitor vx-765 has a similar therapeutic effect on DSS-induced UC mice with T.s intervention, thus indicating that T.s intervention alleviated DSS-induced UC in mice by inhibiting GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis.This study showed that T.s could alleviate the pathological severity UC via GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis, and it provides new insight into the mechanistic study and application of helminths in treating colitis.© 2023.

  Title: Natural compound fraxinellone ameliorates intestinal fibrosis in mice via direct intervention of HSP47-collagen interaction in the epithelium.
  Keywords: HSP47; antifibrotic drugs; collagen; fraxinellone; inflammatory bowel disease; intestinal fibrosis
  PMID: 37580493
  Abstract: Intestinal fibrosis is a common complication of inflammatory bowel disease. There is still a lack of effective drugs for the prevention or treatment of intestinal fibrosis. Heat shock protein 47 (HSP47) plays a key role in the development of intestinal fibrosis. In this study we investigated the therapeutic potential and underlying mechanisms of fraxinellone, a degraded limonoid isolated from the root bark of Dictamnus dasycarpus, in the treatment of intestinal fibrosis. Intestinal fibrosis was induced in mice by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) treatment. DDS-treated mice were administered fraxinellone (7.5, 15, 30 mg·kg-1·d-1, i.g.) for 45 days. We showed that fraxinellone administration dose-dependently alleviated DSS-induced intestinal impairments, and reduced the production of intestinal fibrosis biomarkers such as α-smooth muscle actin (SMA), collagen I, hydroxyproline, fibronectin and laminin, and cytokines such as TGF-β, TNF-α and IL-β. We then established in vitro intestinal fibrosis cell models in SW480 and HT-29 cells, and demonstrated that treatment with fraxinellone (3, 10, 30 μM) significantly relieved TGF-β-induced fibrosis responses by inhibiting the TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling pathway. Molecular docking suggested that the fraxinellone might disrupt the interaction between HSP47 and collagen, which was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. SPR analysis showed that fraxinellone had a high affinity for HSP47 with a Kd value of 3.542 × 10-5 M. This study provides a new example of HSP47-collagen intervention by a natural compound and has important implications for the clinical treatment of inflammation-induced issue fibrosis.© 2023.

  Title: NAD+ salvage governs the immunosuppressive capacity of mesenchymal stem cells.
  Keywords: Glycolysis; HIF-1α; Immunomodulation; Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells; NAD+ metabolism; Succinate
  PMID: 37580400
  Abstract: Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) possess robust immunoregulatory functions and are promising therapeutics for inflammatory disorders. This capacity is not innate but is activated or 'licensed' by inflammatory cytokines. The licensing mechanism remains unclear. Here, we examined whether inflammatory cytokines metabolically reprogrammed MSCs to confer this immunoregulatory capacity. In response to stimulation by inflammatory cytokines, MSCs exhibited a dramatic increase in the consumption of glucose, which was accompanied by an enhanced use of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and increased expression of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), a central enzyme in the salvage pathway for NAD+ production. When NAD+ synthesis was blocked by inhibiting or depleting NAMPT, the immunosuppressive function of MSCs induced by inflammatory cytokines was greatly attenuated. Consequently, when NAD+ metabolism in MSCs was perturbed, their therapeutic benefit was decreased in mice suffering from inflammatory bowel disease and acute liver injury. Further analysis revealed that NAMPT-driven production of NAD+ was critical for the inflammatory cytokine-induced increase in glycolysis in MSCs. Furthermore, the increase in glycolysis led to succinate accumulation in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which led to hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) stabilization and subsequently increased the transcription of key glycolytic genes, thereby persistently maintaining glycolytic flux. This study demonstrated that unlike its proinflammatory role in immune cells, NAD+ metabolism governs the anti-inflammatory function of MSCs during inflammation.© 2023.

  Title: Bacteroides uniformis-induced perturbations in colonic microbiota and bile acid levels inhibit TH17 differentiation and ameliorate colitis developments.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37580334
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with gut dysbiosis and can lead to colitis-associated malignancies. Bacteroides uniformis (Bu) regulates animal intestinal homeostasis; however, the mechanism by which it alleviates colitis in mice remains unknown. We investigated the effects of B. uniformis JCM5828 and its metabolites on female C57BL/6J mice with dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS) induced colitis. Treatment with Bu considerably alleviated colitis progression and restored the mechanical and immune barrier protein expression. Additionally, Bu increased the abundance of the symbiotic bacteria Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus vaginalis while decreasing that of pathogenic Escherichia-Shigella, and modulated intestinal bile acid metabolism. Bu largely regulated the expression of key regulatory proteins of the NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in colonic tissues and the differentiation of TH17 cells. However, Bu could not directly inhibit TH17 cell differentiation in vitro; it modulated the process in the lamina propria by participating in bile acid metabolism and regulating key metabolites (alpha-muricholic, hyodeoxycholic, and isolithocholic acid), thereby modulating the intestinal immune response. Our findings suggest that Bu or bile acid supplements are potential therapies for colitis and other diseases associated with intestinal barrier dysfunction.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited.

  Title: Bacteroides uniformis-induced perturbations in colonic microbiota and bile acid levels inhibit TH17 differentiation and ameliorate colitis developments.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37580334
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with gut dysbiosis and can lead to colitis-associated malignancies. Bacteroides uniformis (Bu) regulates animal intestinal homeostasis; however, the mechanism by which it alleviates colitis in mice remains unknown. We investigated the effects of B. uniformis JCM5828 and its metabolites on female C57BL/6J mice with dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS) induced colitis. Treatment with Bu considerably alleviated colitis progression and restored the mechanical and immune barrier protein expression. Additionally, Bu increased the abundance of the symbiotic bacteria Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus vaginalis while decreasing that of pathogenic Escherichia-Shigella, and modulated intestinal bile acid metabolism. Bu largely regulated the expression of key regulatory proteins of the NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in colonic tissues and the differentiation of TH17 cells. However, Bu could not directly inhibit TH17 cell differentiation in vitro; it modulated the process in the lamina propria by participating in bile acid metabolism and regulating key metabolites (alpha-muricholic, hyodeoxycholic, and isolithocholic acid), thereby modulating the intestinal immune response. Our findings suggest that Bu or bile acid supplements are potential therapies for colitis and other diseases associated with intestinal barrier dysfunction.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited.

  Title: New biologic (Ab-IPL-IL-17) for IL-17-mediated diseases: identification of the bioactive sequence (nIL-17) for IL-17A/F function.
  Keywords: arthritis, rheumatoid; autoimmune diseases; autoimmunity; inflammation
  PMID: 37580108
  Abstract: Interleukin (IL) 17s cytokines are key drivers of inflammation that are functionally dysregulated in several human immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Targeting these cytokines has some therapeutic benefits, but issues associated with low therapeutic efficacy and immunogenicity for subgroups of patients or IMIDs reduce their clinical use. Therefore, there is an urgent need to improve the coverage and efficacy of antibodies targeting IL-17A and/or IL-17F and IL-17A/F heterodimer.Here, we initially identified a bioactive 20 amino acid IL-17A/F-derived peptide (nIL-17) that mimics the pro-inflammatory actions of the full-length proteins. Subsequently, we generated a novel anti-IL-17 neutralising monoclonal antibody (Ab-IPL-IL-17) capable of effectively reversing the pro-inflammatory, pro-migratory actions of both nIL-17 and IL-17A/F. Importantly, we demonstrated that Ab-IPL-IL-17 has less off-target effects than the current gold-standard biologic, secukinumab. Finally, we compared the therapeutic efficacy of Ab-IPL-IL-17 with reference anti-IL-17 antibodies in preclinical murine models and samples from patients with RA and IBD. We found that Ab-IPL-IL-17 could effectively reduce clinical signs of arthritis and neutralise elevated IL-17 levels in IBD patient serum.Collectively, our preclinical and in vitro clinical evidence indicates high efficacy and therapeutic potency of Ab-IPL-IL-17, supporting the rationale for large-scale clinical evaluation of Ab-IPL-IL-17 in patients with IMIDs.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

  Title: Severity of nocturia and constipation in patients with ulcerative colitis.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37579856
  Abstract: To investigate the association between nocturia and constipation in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Constipation has recently been recognized as an important symptom in patients with UC. Although nocturia has been associated with constipation in the general population, the association between nocturia and constipation in UC patients is uncertain.Consecutive series of 290 Japanese patients with UC, Information on constipation, nocturia, and lifestyle habits was obtained using self-administered questionnaires. The definition of constipation was based on Rome I criteria and/or current medication for constipation. Patients were divided into three groups based on nighttime urination: 1) no nocturia, 2) mild nocturia (nocturnal urination - one), and 3) serious nocturia (nocturnal urination - two or more). Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between nocturia and constipation.Among all of the UC patients, the prevalence of mild nocturia, serious nocturia, and constipation was 35.2%, 26.9%, and 12.4%, respectively. The prevalence of constipation in the none, mild, and serious nocturia groups was 8.2%, 10.8%, and 20.5%, respectively. After adjustment for confounders such as age, sex, current drinking, current smoking, body mass index, and steroid use, nocturia severity was independently and positively associated with constipation (adjusted odds ratio for mild nocturia: 1.55 [95% confidence interval: 0.57-4.28], serious nocturia: 3.19 [95% confidence interval: 1.09-9.81], p for trend = 0.035).The severity of nocturia is positively associated with constipation, and physicians should consider the interrelationships between nocturia and constipation in managing UC patients.Copyright © 2023.

  Title: Adalimumab-induced paradoxical psoriasis treated with biologics targeting the IL-17/IL-23 axis in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37579735
  Abstract: Background Paradoxical psoriasis (PP) has been mainly described in patients receiving tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)-inhibitors for inflammatory bowel disease or psoriasis vulgaris, while such data in the context of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) are scarce. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the course of PP and the underlying HS upon switching from adalimumab to a biologic agent targeting the interleukin (IL)-17/IL-23 axis. Methods The electronic medical database of the outpatient department for HS of a tertiary hospital for skin diseases was searched to identify patients with moderate to severe HS under treatment with adalimumab, who developed PP and were switched to biological therapy with an IL-17 or IL-23 inhibitor between February 2016 and January 2022. Disease assessment scores were evaluated at baseline, at time of PP development as well as six and twelve months thereafter. Results Among the 83 patients who received adalimumab the treatment of HS between February 2016 and January 2022, 10 patients (12%) developed paradoxical psoriasiform skin reactions after a median time of seven (range, 2-48) months. There were four females (40%) and six males (60%) with a median age of 42,5 (range, 33-56) years. Five patients presented with plaque psoriasis and five with palmoplantar pustulosis, while four had intertriginous and three nail involvement. In most of the patients the HS responded well to adalimumab at onset of PP. Eight patients were changed to secukinumab, one to ustekinumab and one to rizankizumab. The HS further improved in all but two patients, one receiving secukinumab and one receiving rizankizumab. In addition, all patients achieved improvement of PP. Conclusion Despite the small number of patients, this study provides support that patients with adalimumab-induced PP may benefit from biologics targeting IL-17/IL-23 axis. Further studies are needed, to establish the optimal therapeutic strategy of the anti-TNFα-induced PP in the context of HS.S. Karger AG, Basel.

  Title: Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Risk of Global Cardiovascular Diseases and Type 2 Diabetes.
  Keywords: Crohn’s disease; cardiovascular disease; causality; type 2 diabetes; ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37579307
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was associated with elevated risk of cardiometabolic diseases in observational studies. We aimed to evaluate the observational and genetic associations of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) with multiple cardiometabolic outcomes.Our phenotypic and genetic association analyses included more than 400 000 participants who were free of major cardiovascular disease and diabetes at recruitment (2006-2010) and were followed up until December 2019 based on the UK Biobank. For the Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses, 415 and 273 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with CD and UC, respectively, were selected as genetic instruments. Summary-level data on individual cardiometabolic outcomes were obtained from 4 different genome-wide association studies with a total of 2 248 842 participants.In the multivariable-adjusted observational analyses, CD was associated with higher risks of heart failure (hazard ratio [HR], 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-2.42) and type 2 diabetes (HR, 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.67-2.67) but not with myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke. UC was related to increased risks of all the assessed cardiometabolic diseases (HRs ranged from 1.29 for myocardial infarction to 1.76 for type 2 diabetes). Conversely, neither the genetic risk score for CD nor that for UC was associated with higher risk of developing cardiometabolic diseases. In 2-sample MR analyses, genetically determined CD and UC were not associated with any of the assessed cardiometabolic diseases (all P values >.05).Despite confirming the observational associations, our study does not support a causal association between IBD and elevated risk of cardiometabolic diseases.© The Author(s) 2023.

  Title: Thiazide Diuretics and Risk of Colorectal Cancer: A Population-Based Cohort Study.
  Keywords: antihypertensive drugs; calcium channel blockers; cohort; colorectal cancer; dihydropyridine; propensity score; thiazide diuretics
  PMID: 37579305
  Abstract: Evidence from clinical trials and observational studies on the association between thiazide diuretics and colorectal cancer risk is conflicting. We aimed to determine whether thiazide diuretics are associated with an increased colorectal cancer risk compared with dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (dCCBs).A population-based, new-user cohort was assembled using the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Between 1990-2018, we compared thiazide diuretic initiators with dCCB initiators and estimated hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of colorectal cancer using Cox proportional hazard models. Models were weighted using standardized morbidity ratio weights generated from calendar time-specific propensity scores.The cohort included 377,760 thiazide diuretic initiators and 364,300 dCCB initiators, generating 3,619,883 person-years of follow-up. Compared with dCCBs, thiazide diuretics were not associated with colorectal cancer (weighted HR:0.97, 95% CI:0.90-1.04). Secondary analyses yielded similar results, although an increased risk was observed among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (weighted HR:2.45, 95% CI:1.13-5.35) and potentially polyps (weighted HR:1.46, 95% CI:0.93-2.30).Compared with dCCBs, thiazide diuretics were not associated with an overall increased colorectal cancer risk. While these findings provide some reassurance, research is needed to corroborate the elevated risks observed among patients with inflammatory bowel disease and history of polyps.© The Author(s) 2023.

  Title: Tumor necrosis factor-like cytokine 1A plays a role in inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis.
  Keywords: TL1A; dendritic cell; inflammatory bowel disease
  PMID: 37579137
  Abstract: The binding of tumor necrosis factor-like cytokine 1A (TL1A) to death receptor 3 (DR3) plays an important role in the interaction between dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells and contributes to intestinal inflammation development. However, the mechanism by which DCs expressing TL1A mediate helper T (Th) cell differentiation in the intestinal lamina propria (LP) during the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease remains unclear. In this study, we found that TL1A/DR3 promoted Th1 and Th17 cell differentiation in T-T and DC-T cell interaction-dependent manners. TL1A-deficient CD4+ T cells failed to polarize into Th1/Th17 cells and did not cause colonic inflammation in a T cell transfer colitis model. Notably, TL1A was located in the cytoplasm and nuclei of DCs, positively regulated the DC-specific ICAM-grabbing nonintegrin/RAF1/nuclear factor κB signaling pathway, enhanced the antigen uptake ability of DCs, and promoted TLR4-mediated DC activation, inducing naive CD4+ T cell differentiation into Th1 and Th17 cells. Our work reveals that TL1A plays a regulatory role in inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis.

  Title: Abdominal pain is associated with an increased risk of future healthcare resource utilization in inflammatory bowel disease.
  Keywords: Abdominal pain; Healthcare resource utilization; Inflammatory bowel disease
  PMID: 37578543
  Abstract: Numerous factors influence healthcare resource utilization (HRU) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We previously demonstrated an association between the presence of certain IBD-related symptoms and HRU. We conducted a longitudinal study to identify the clinical variables and IBD-related symptoms predictive of HRU.This investigation utilized clinical encounters at an IBD center within a tertiary care referral center between 10/29/2015-12/31/2019. Participants were assessed over two time points (index and follow-up office visits) separated by a minimum of 6 months. Demographics, endoscopic disease severity, totals and sub-scores of surveys assessing for IBD-related symptoms, HRU, and substance use, and IBD-related medications. HRU was defined as any IBD-related emergency room visit, hospitalization, or surgery during the 6 months prior to follow-up appointment. We identified patients exhibiting HRU (at follow-up) and computed descriptive statistics and contingency table analyses of index appointment clinical data to identify predictors of HRU. Multivariable logistic regression models were fit incorporating significant demographic and clinical factors.162 consecutively enrolled IBD patients (mean age 44.0 years; 99f:63 m; 115 Crohn's disease [CD], 45 ulcerative colitis [UC], 2 indeterminate colitis) were included. 121 patients (74.7%) exhibited HRU (mean age 43.6 years; 73f:48 m; 84 CD, 36 UC, 1 IC) preceding follow-up appointment. Abdominal pain (OR = 2.18, 95% CI 1.04-4.35, p = 0.04) at the index appointment was the only study variable significantly associated with HRU on bivariate analysis (Table 1). However, none of the clinical factors evaluated in this study were independently associated with HRU in our multivariable logistic regression model.In this longitudinal study, abdominal pain was the only clinical variable that demonstrated an association with future HRU (even when considering other symptoms and key variables such as disease activity, IBD-medications, and psychiatric comorbidities (i.e., anxious or depressed state). These findings reinforce the importance of regularly screening for and effectively treating abdominal pain in IBD.© 2023.

  Title: A comparison of treatment effect sizes in matched phase 2 and phase 3 trials of advanced therapeutics in inflammatory bowel disease: systematic review and meta-analysis.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37578211
  Abstract: Phase 2 trials are fundamental to the rational and efficient design of phase 3 trials. We aimed to determine the relationship of treatment effect size estimates from phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials on advanced therapeutics in inflammatory bowel disease.MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane library were searched from inception to December 19, 2022, to identify paired phase 2 and 3 placebo-controlled induction studies of advanced therapeutics for Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Treatment effect sizes were expressed as a risk ratio (RR) between the active arm and placebo arm. For the same therapeutics, RR from phase 2 trials were divided by the RR from phase 3 trial to quantify the relationship of effect sizes between phases.Twenty-two studies (9 phase 2 trials, 13 phase 3 trials) were included for CD and 30 studies (12 phase 2 trials, 18 phase 3 trials) for UC. In UC (pooled RR 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.58-0.86; RR <1 indicate smaller treatment effect sizes in phase 2 trials), but not CD (pooled RR 1.01; 95% CI: 0.84-1.18), phase 2 trials systematically underestimated treatment effect sizes for the primary endpoint compared to phase 3 trials. The underestimation was observed for clinical, but not endoscopic endpoints in UC.Treatment effect sizes for the primary and clinical endpoints were similar across clinical trial phases in CD, but not UC, where only endoscopic endpoints were comparable. This will help inform clinical development plans and future trial design.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

  Title: The impact of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease on inflammatory bowel disease-related hospitalization outcomes: a systematic review.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37577829
  Abstract: Evidence suggests that patients with inflammatory bowel disease are at higher risk of developing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, there is limited information currently available on how NAFLD may affect the clinical course of IBD. Thus, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate the impact of NAFLD on IBD-related hospitalization outcomes. All observational studies assessing IBD-related hospitalization outcomes in patients with NAFLD were included. Exclusion criteria were studies published in languages other than English or French, or those involving pediatric population. Outcomes included IBD-related hospitalization and readmission rates, need for surgery, length of stay, inpatient mortality, and costs. Overall, 3252 citations were retrieved and seven studies met the inclusion criteria (1 574 937 patients); all were observational, of high quality, and originated in the United States. Measurable outcomes reported in these studies were few and with insufficient similarity across studies to complete a quantitative assessment. Only one study reports NAFLD severity. Two studies suggested a higher rate of hospitalization for patients with both NAFLD and IBD compared to IBD alone (incidence rate ratio of 1.54; 95% confidence interval: 1.33-1.79). This is the first systematic review to date that evaluates any possible association of NAFLD with IBD-related hospitalization outcomes. Despite the paucity and low quality of available data, our findings indicate that NAFLD may be associated with worse outcomes amongst IBD patients (especially Crohn's disease). Further and higher certainty of evidence is needed for better characterization of such clinical impact.Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

  Title: Risk and incidence of colorectal stricture progressing to colorectal neoplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37577790
  Abstract: This study aims to assess the risk of colorectal stricture progressing to colorectal neoplasia (CRN) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The literature from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases was searched from the date of databases' creation to 5 November 2022. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the quality of the included literature. Meta-analysis was conducted using the Stata 15 software and R 4.04 software. Two case-control studies and 12 cohort studies were eventually included. Colorectal stricture in patients with IBD increased the risk of progressing to CRN [odds ratio (OR): 1.52, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02-2.29, P = 0.042], but was irrelevant to the risk of progressing to ACRN (OR: 3.56, 95% CI 0.56-22.70, P = 0.180). The risk of CRN were further distinguished in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) Our findings showed that colorectal stricture may increase the risk of progressing to CRN in patients with UC (OR = 3.53, 95%CI 1.62-7.68, P = 0.001), but was irrelevant to the risk of progressing to CRN in patients with CD (OR = 1.09, 95% CI 0.54-2.21, P = 0.811). In conclusion, colorectal stricture in patients with IBD can be used as a risk factor for predicting CRN but cannot be used as a risk factor for predicting ACRN. Stricture is a risk factor for CRN in patients with UC but not in patients with CD. More prospective, multi-center studies with large samples are expected to confirm our findings.Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

  Title: Extraintestinal Manifestations in Induced Colitis: Controversial Effects of N-Acetylcysteine on Colon, Liver, and Kidney.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37577725
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic and recurrent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterized by continuous inflammation in the colonic mucosa. Extraintestinal manifestations (EIM) occur due to the disruption of the intestinal barrier and increased permeability caused by redox imbalance, dysbiosis, and inflammation originating from the intestine and contribute to morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of oral N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on colonic, hepatic, and renal tissues in mice with colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Male Swiss mice received NAC (150 mg/kg/day) in the drinking water for 30 days before and during (DSS 5% v/v; for 7 days) colitis induction. On the 38th day, colon, liver, and kidney were collected and adequately prepared for the analysis of oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reduced (GSH), glutathione oxidized (GSSG), malondialdehyde (MDA), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)) and inflammatory biomarkers (myeloperoxidase (MPO) -, tumor necrosis factor alpha - (TNF-α, and interleukin-10 (IL-10)). In colon, NAC protected the histological architecture. However, NAC did not level up SOD, in contrast, it increased MDA and pro-inflammatory effect (increased of TNF-α and decreased of IL-10). In liver, colitis caused both oxidative (MDA, SOD, and GSH) and inflammatory damage (IL-10). NAC was able only to increase GSH and GSH/GSSG ratio. Kidney was not affected by colitis; however, NAC despite increasing CAT, GSH, and GSH/GSSG ratio promoted lipid peroxidation (increased MDA) and pro-inflammatory action (decreased IL-10). Despite some beneficial antioxidant effects of NAC, the negative outcomes concerning irreversible oxidative and inflammatory damage in the colon, liver, and kidney confirm the nonsafety of the prophylactic use of this antioxidant in models of induced colitis, suggesting that additional studies are needed, and its use in humans not yet recommended for the therapeutic routine of this disease.Copyright © 2023 Amylly Sanuelly da Paz Martins et al.

  Keywords: CDI; Clostridioides difficile; diarrhea; gut dysbiosis; inflammatory bowel disease; metabolites; microbiome
  PMID: 37577378
  Abstract: Low diversity gut dysbiosis can take different forms depending on the disease context. In this study, we used shotgun metagenomic sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to compared the metagenomic and metabolomic profiles of Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile diarrheal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients and defined the additive effect of C. difficile infection (CDI) on intestinal dysbiosis.The study cohort consisted of 138 case-mix cancer patients, 43 IBD patients, and 45 healthy control individuals. Thirty-three patients were also infected with C. difficile. In the control group, three well-known enterotypes were identified, while the other groups presented with an additional Escherichia-driven enterotype. Bacterial diversity was significantly lower in all groups than in healthy controls, while the highest level of bacterial species richness was observed in cancer patients. Fifty-six bacterial species had abundance levels that differentiated diarrheal patient groups from the control group. Of these species, 52 and 4 (Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Ruminococcus gnavus) were under-represented and over-represented, respectively, in all diarrheal patient groups. The relative abundances of propionate and butyrate were significantly lower in fecal samples from IBD and CDI patients than in control samples. Isobutyrate, propanate, and butyrate concentrations were lower in cancer, IBD, and CDI samples, respectively. Glycine and valine amino acids were over- represented in diarrheal patients.Our data indicate that different external and internal factors drive comparable profiles of low diversity dysbiosis. While diarrheal-related low diversity dysbiosis may be a consequence of systemic cancer therapy, a similar phenotype is observed in cases of moderate to severe IBD, and in both cases, dysbiosis is exacerbated by incidence of CDI.Copyright © 2023 Kulecka, Zeber-Lubecka, Bałabas, Czarnowski, Bagińska, Głowienka, Kluska, Piątkowska, Dąbrowska, Waker, Mikula and Ostrowski.

  Abstract: Low diversity gut dysbiosis can take different forms depending on the disease context. In this study, we used shotgun metagenomic sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to compared the metagenomic and metabolomic profiles of Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile diarrheal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients and defined the additive effect of C. difficile infection (CDI) on intestinal dysbiosis.The study cohort consisted of 138 case-mix cancer patients, 43 IBD patients, and 45 healthy control individuals. Thirty-three patients were also infected with C. difficile. In the control group, three well-known enterotypes were identified, while the other groups presented with an additional Escherichia-driven enterotype. Bacterial diversity was significantly lower in all groups than in healthy controls, while the highest level of bacterial species richness was observed in cancer patients. Fifty-six bacterial species had abundance levels that differentiated diarrheal patient groups from the control group. Of these species, 52 and 4 (Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Ruminococcus gnavus) were under-represented and over-represented, respectively, in all diarrheal patient groups.

  Title: Identifying predictors of clinical outcomes using the projection-predictive feature selection-a proof of concept on the example of Crohn's disease.
  Keywords: Bayesian; C-reactive protein; Shiny application; calprotectin; endoscopy; inflammatory bowel disease; monitoring; ordinal regression model
  PMID: 37576142
  Abstract: Several clinical disease activity indices (DAIs) have been developed to noninvasively assess mucosal healing in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). However, their clinical application can be complex. Therefore, we present a new way to identify the most informative biomarkers for mucosal inflammation from current markers in use and, based on this, how to obtain an easy-to-use DAI for clinical practice. A further aim of our proof-of-concept study is to demonstrate how the performance of such a new DAI can be compared to that of existing DAIs.The data of two independent study cohorts, with 167 visits from 109 children and adolescents with CD, were evaluated retrospectively. A variable selection based on a Bayesian ordinal regression model was applied to select clinical or standard laboratory parameters as predictors, using an endoscopic outcome. The predictive performance of the resulting model was compared to that of existing pediatric DAIs.With our proof-of-concept dataset, the resulting model included C-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin (FC) as predictors. In general, our model performed better than the existing DAIs. To show how our Bayesian approach can be applied in practice, we developed a web application for predicting disease activity for a new CD patient or visit.Our work serves as a proof-of-concept, showing that the statistical methods used here can identify biomarkers relevant for the prediction of a clinical outcome. In our case, a small number of biomarkers is sufficient, which, together with the web interface, facilitates the clinical application. However, the retrospective nature of our study, the rather small amount of data, and the lack of an external validation cohort do not allow us to consider our results as the establishment of a novel DAI for pediatric CD. This needs to be done with the help of a prospective study with more data and an external validation cohort in the future.© 2023 Wirthgen, Weber, Kubickova-Weber, Schiller, Schiller, Radke and Däbritz.

  Title: Promoting early testing and appropriate referral to reduce diagnostic delay for children with suspected inflammatory bowel disease, a narrative review.
  Keywords: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); diagnostic; laboratory parameters; referral; risk factors
  PMID: 37575896
  Abstract: When a child with chronic gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms presents to a primary care physician or general paediatrician, the clinician is challenged with differentiating between functional or organic disease. When there is a high suspicion of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rapid referral to a paediatric gastroenterologist for assessment and treatment will help protect against the sequelae of a delayed diagnosis for a child. However, this must be balanced against the need for ensuring appropriate referrals and avoiding invasive diagnostic testing for those with non-organic aetiology. The objective of this narrative review was to present evidence on specific presenting symptoms, testing, and risk factors of paediatric IBD that may aid the identification of children requiring timely referral for specialist care, thereby reducing the chance of a delayed diagnosis.Literature databases (Medline, Embase) were searched using terms specific to the population studied, and topic specific terms relating to each section of the review. Year limits were set for 2010-2022. Included papers were limited to original research, with meta-analyses considered where of benefit.Children often present with non-specific GI symptoms that may be associated with a delayed diagnosis for those with subsequent IBD. Symptoms such as rectal bleeding or weight loss may indicate the need for rapid referral. However, non-specific symptoms necessitate testing strategies to differentiate between those with possible IBD and non-organic conditions. Definitive laboratory testing for IBD is not yet available. This review outlines those metrics that should be considered and monitored, then utilised to make a comprehensive referral to tertiary care for specialist paediatric gastroenterology review. Summaries are provided relating to presenting symptoms, extra-intestinal manifestations (EIMs), and alarm symptoms in order to highlight those reported most frequently. The diagnostic accuracy and importance of interpreting faecal calprotectin (FC) levels, in conjunction with additional measures, are also outlined.Diagnostic testing to effectively identify children with IBD without the need for endoscopy is not yet available. Primary care physicians and general paediatricians must, therefore, rely on interpreting a combination of symptoms, laboratory parameters, and risk factors to assess the need for specialist referral and diagnosis.2023 Translational Pediatrics.

  Title: Jejunal Inflammation in Crohn's Disease: Comparison between Diffusion Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Video Capsule Endoscopy.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37574895
  Abstract: Jejunal disease is associated with worse prognosis in Crohn's disease. The added value of diffusion weighted imaging for evaluating jejunal inflammation related to Crohn's Disease is scarce.To compare diffusion weighted imaging, video capsule endoscopy, and inflammatory biomarkers in the assessment of Crohn's disease involving the jejunum.Crohn's disease patients in clinical remission were prospectively recruited and underwent magnetic resonance (MR)-enterography and video capsule endoscopy. C-reactive protein and fecal-calprotectin levels were obtained. MR-enterography images were evaluated for restricted diffusion, and apparent diffusion coefficient values were measured. The video capsule endoscopy-based Lewis score was calculated. Associations between diffusion weighted imaging, apparent diffusion coefficient, Lewis score, and inflammatory biomarkers were evaluated.The study included 51 patients, and 27/51 (52.9%) with video capsule endoscopies showed jejunal mucosal inflammation. Sensitivity and specificity of restricted diffusion for video capsule endoscopy mucosal inflammation were 59.3% and 37.5% for the first reader, and 66.7% and 37.5% for the second reader, respectively. Diffusion weighted imaging was not statistically associated with jejunal video capsule endoscopy inflammation (P = 0.813).Diffusion weighted imaging was not an effective test for evaluation of jejunal inflammation as seen by video capsule endoscopy in patients with quiescent Crohn's disease.

  Title: Golimumab improves health-related quality of life of patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: Results of the go-care study.
  Keywords: Golimumab; Inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire; Ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37574431
  Abstract: In recent years, improvement of Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in Ulcerative colitis (UC) has become a relevant measure for treatment efficacy.We report results from a multicenter prospective study in Italy investigating HRQoL in adult patients with UC treated with golimumab (GLM). Patients who had shown clinical response after a 6-week induction phase (w0), were followed for an additional 48 weeks (w48) (total 54-week treatment).Of the 159 patients enrolled 90 completed the study. Compared to values at the beginning of treatment (n = 137), significant improvements were observed for mean total Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) scores at w0 (168.5) and w48 (181.7). Patients with baseline PMS above the median tended to have greater improvements in IBDQ at w0 (OR 2.037, p = 0.033) and w48 (OR 3.292, p = 0.027). Compared to beginning of GLM treatment, the mean Full Mayo Score (FMS) decreased by 5.9 points at w48, while mean Partial Mayo Score (PMS) decreased by 3.9 points at w0 and by 4.9 points at w48.GLM improved HRQoL, disease activity and inflammatory biomarkers in UC patients with moderate-to-severely active disease. The greater the burden of disease activity at baseline, the greater the improvement of HRQoL after 24 and 48 weeks of treatment.Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

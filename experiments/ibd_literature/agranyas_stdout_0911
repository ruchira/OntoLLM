DEBUG:root:Input text: Title: Role of epigenetic modifications mediated by vitamins and trace elements in inflammatory bowel disease.
Keywords: IBD; epigenetic modifications; inflammatory bowel disease; trace elements; vitamins
PMID: 37694343
Abstract: Graphical abstract [Formula: see text] Numerous environmental factors frequently emerge as primary determinants of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Diet is a major component of environmental factors, and the consumption of vitamins (A, B, C and D) and trace elements (calcium, iron, zinc and selenium) exerts an impact on the progression of IBD through epigenetic modifications. Intake of vitamins A, B, C and D, as well as excessive amounts of iron and calcium, can modulate the condition of IBD by regulating the levels of DNA methylation, histone acetylation and miRNA. Zinc and selenium alleviate the progression of IBD by regulating the levels of promoter methylation or histone ubiquitination, respectively. Graphical Abstract was adapted from 'Epigenetic levels (layout)', by BioRender.com. Retrieved from https://app.biorender.com/biorender-templates.

Keywords: immune response; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; luteolin; metabolomics; oxidative stress; ulcerative colitis
PMID: 37693835
Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease and associated with metabolic imbalance. Luteolin (LUT) reportedly exhibits anti-inflammatory activity. However, its regulatory effects on metabolites remain indistinct. Here, the effects of LUT on immune response and oxidative stress in UC were determined. Serum metabolomics profiles of UC rats treated with LUT were obtained utilizing liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results revealed that LUT treatment alleviated colon tissue injury, colon shortening, weight loss, and inflammatory response in UC rats. Additionally, the levels of superoxide dismutase and total antioxidant capacity were elevated, but malondialdehyde content was reduced in serum of UC rats, while these changes were abrogated by LUT. Metabolomics analysis unveiled that l-malic acid, creatinine, l-glutamine, and l-lactic acid levels were remarkably decreased, while dimethyl sulfone, 5-methylcytosine, cysteine-S-sulfate, and jasmonic acid levels were notably increased after LUT treatment. Furthermore, differential metabolites primarily participated in d-glutamine and d-glutamate metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and citrate cycle pathways. In summary, these results demonstrated that LUT improved immune response, alleviated oxidative stress, and altered metabolites in UC rats. This study lays the root for further exploring the mechanism of LUT in the treatment of UC.© 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.

DEBUG:root:Input text: Title: The causal relationship between autoimmune diseases and osteoporosis: a study based on Mendelian randomization.
Keywords: bone mineral density; fall risk; fracture risk; osteoporosis; two-sample Mendelian randomization
PMID: 37693362
Abstract: The relationship between different autoimmune diseases and bone mineral density (BMD) and fractures has been reported in epidemiological studies. This study aimed to explore the causal relationship between autoimmune diseases and BMD, falls, and fractures using Mendelian randomization (MR).The instrumental variables were selected from the aggregated statistical data of these diseases from the largest genome-wide association study in Europe. Specifically, 12 common autoimmune diseases were selected as exposure. Outcome variables included BMD, falls, and fractures. Multiple analysis methods were utilized to comprehensively evaluate the causal relationship between autoimmune diseases and BMD, falls, and fractures. Additionally, sensitivity analyses, including Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, and one analysis, were conducted to verify the result's reliability.Strong evidence was provided in the results of the negatively association of ulcerative colitis (UC) with forearm BMD. UC also had a negatively association with the total body BMD, while inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) depicted a negatively association with the total body BMD at the age of 45-60 years. Horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity was not detected through sensitivity analysis, indicating that the causal estimation was reliable.This study shows a negative causal relationship between UC and forearm and total body BMD, and between IBD and total body BMD at the age of 45-60 years. These results should be considered in future research and when public health measures and osteoporosis prevention strategies are formulated.Copyright © 2023 Wu, Ye, Yan, Zhan, Ren, Zhou, Chen, Yao, Zhu, Wu, Ma, Liu, Fan and Liu.

Keywords: Animal experimentation; Necrotizing enterocolitis; Vascular endothelial growth factor A
PMID: 37693290
Abstract: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating disease that can cause mortality in preterm babies. NEC may develop through an apoptotic pathway that is known to be inhibited by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This study determined whether VEGF exerted a protective effect against the development of NEC and apoptosis in rats.To determine the effect of VEGF in NEC rats, neonatal rats were randomized into 4 groups: the control group, the NEC group, the NEC + intraperitoneal VEGF (50 ng/kg) group (NEC + VEGF IP group), and the NEC + oral VEGF (50 ng/kg) group (NEC + VEGF OR group). NEC was induced by lipopolysaccharide/hypoxia and cold stress. The animals were sacrificed 72 hours later. After laparotomy, we obtained a region of the proximal small bowel from the ileocecal valve about 18 cm in length.The NEC histological grade, apoptosis histological score, and caspase-3 activity were lower in the NEC + VEGF IP and OR groups than in the NEC group. In the NEC + VEGF IP and OR groups, the messenger RNA expression of apoptotic and inflammatory genes, such as Bax, NF-κB, p53, Fas, FasL, and PAF-R, but not that of Bcl-2, was decreased, as was the Bax/Bcl-2 protein ratio. Histological analysis revealed that the apoptosis-blocking effect of VEGF was more effective in the NEC + VEGF IP group than in the NEC + VEGF OR group.We identified apoptotic and inflammatory genes to confirm the preventive effect of VEGF pretreatment on NEC in rats. This study presents a novel approach to prevent apoptosis via VEGF pretreatment in rats with lipopolysaccharide/hypoxia-induced NEC.Copyright © 2023, the Korean Surgical Society.

DEBUG:root:Input text: Title: Therapeutic effect of bromelain and papain on intestinal injury induced by indomethacin in male rats.
Keywords: Intestinal injury; bromelain; indomethacin; papain; sulfasalazine
PMID: 37692988
Abstract: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are a multiple inflammatory status in small intestines and colon. Bromelain and Papain were cysteine proteases enzymes extracted from pineapple and papaya, and possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory characteristics. Therefore, this comparative work aimed to examine the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effect of bromelain and papain in intestinal inflammation of rats and to evaluate the most potent effect of both types of enzymes.Forty rats were used in this study (8 rats/group), G1: control group, G2: (Indo group) intestinal inflammation was induced by two doses of Indomethacin (7.5 mg/kg body weight) apart 24 h. G3: (Indomethacin + Bromelain) intestinal inflamed rats treated by oral dose of bromelain (1000 mg/kg/day). G4: (Indomethacin + Papain) intestinal inflamed rats treated by oral dose of papain (800 mg/kg/day). G5: (Indomethacin + Sulfasalazine) intestinal inflamed rats treated by oral dose of sulfasalazine (500 mg/kg/day). Oxidative stress and inflammatory markers were measured along with histological assessment.Indomethacin-induced intestinal inflammation (in both Jejunum and Ileum) characterized by increased oxidative stress biomarkers: Xanthine oxidase, Catalase, Glutathione reductase, and Protein carbonyl and Inflammatory biomarkers: Tumor necrosis factor-α, Interleukin-10, Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, Nuclear factor-kappa β, C-reactive protein, and Prostaglandin E2, as compared to control rats. On the other hand, administering either bromelain or Papain would effectively decrease symptoms of intestinal inflammation and modulate biomarkers of oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines.Comparing results revealed that bromelain showed the most potent protective effect and possesses an apparent role in protection against the development of intestinal inflammation.Copyright: © International Journal of Health Sciences.

Keywords: Crohn’s disease; GWAS; inflammatory bowel disease; mendelian randomization; pancreatic cancer; risk factor; ulcerative colitis
PMID: 37692850
Abstract: The nuanced relationship between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and pancreatic cancer is noticed in recent years. However, the underlying causal effects of these two diseases are still unclear.The two-sample mendelian randomization (MR) was conducted to explore the causal effect of IBD condition on pancreatic cancer. Methods of Wald ratio, inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode were used to investigate the causal relationship between IBD and pancreatic cancer. Besides, Cochrane's Q test, MR-Egger, and leave-one-out method were further conducted to detect heterogeneity, stability, and pleiotropy of MR results.In the MR analysis, we found Crohn's disease had a significant causal effect on pancreatic cancer. Specifically, Crohn's disease would increase 11.1% the risk of pancreatic cancer by the IVW method (p= 0.022), 33.8% by MR Egger (p= 0.015), by 35.3% by the Weighted model (p= 0.005). Regarding ulcerative colitis, there was no statistically significant causal effect observed on pancreatic cancer (p>0.05). Additionally, the pleiotropic test and Leave-one-out analysis both proved the validity and reliability of the present two-sample MR analyses.This study indicates that IBD, particularly Crohn's disease, is causality associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer. Our results may help public health managers to make better follow-up surveillance of IBD patients.Copyright © 2023 Min, Liu, Li, Jin, Wei, Pei, Hu and Peng.

PMID: 37692785
Abstract: Serum lipid levels seem to be abnormal in Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the specific manifestation of abnormal serum lipid levels in IBD are heterogeneous among studies and have not been sufficiently determined yet.PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched. Serum lipid levels were compared between IBD patients and Health individuals, Crohn's (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), active and inactive, mild and non-mild patients, respectively. Meta-analyses were performed by using a random-effect model. Weight mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.Overall, 53 studies were included. Compared with healthy controls, IBD patients had significantly lower TC (WMD = -0.506, 95%CI = -0.674 to -0.338, p < 0.001), HDL-c (WMD = -0.122, 95%CI = -0.205 to -0.039, p = 0.004), and LDL-c (WMD = -0.371, 95%CI = -0.547 to -0.194, p < 0.001) levels. CD groups had a significantly lower TC (WMD = -0.349, 95%CI = -0.528 to -0.170, p < 0.0001) level as compared to UC groups. Active IBD and non-mild UC groups had significantly lower TC (WMD = -0.454, 95%CI = -0.722 to -0.187, p = 0.001) (WMD =0.462, 95%CI = 0.176 to 0.748, p = 0.002) and LDL-c (WMD = -0.225, 95%CI = -0.445 to -0.005, p = 0.045) (WMD =0.346, 95%CI = 0.084-0.609, p = 0.010) levels as compared to inactive IBD and mild UC groups, respectively.The overall level of serum lipids in IBD patients is lower than that of healthy individuals and is negatively associated with disease severity.https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier: CRD42022383885.Copyright © 2023 Chen, Li, Hu, Xu, Lu, Zhu and Shen.

Keywords: enteric glia; enteric nervous system; gut epithelial barrier; inflammatory bowel disease; intrinsic primary afferent neurons
PMID: 37692784
Abstract: The intestinal mucosal surface forms one of the largest areas of the body, which is in direct contact with the environment. Co-ordinated sensory functions of immune, epithelial, and neuronal cells ensure the timely detection of noxious queues and potential pathogens and elicit proportional responses to mitigate the threats and maintain homeostasis. Such tuning and maintenance of the epithelial barrier is constantly ongoing during homeostasis and its derangement can become a gateway for systemic consequences. Although efforts in understanding the gatekeeping functions of immune cells have led the way, increasing number of studies point to a crucial role of the enteric nervous system in fine-tuning and maintaining this delicate homeostasis. The identification of immune regulatory functions of enteric neuropeptides and glial-derived factors is still in its infancy, but has already yielded several intriguing insights into their important contribution to the tight control of the mucosal barrier. In this review, we will first introduce the reader to the current understanding of the architecture of the enteric nervous system and the epithelial barrier. Next, we discuss the key discoveries and cellular pathways and mediators that have emerged as links between the enteric nervous, immune, and epithelial systems and how their coordinated actions defend against intestinal infectious and inflammatory diseases. Through this review, the readers will gain a sound understanding of the current neuro-immune-epithelial mechanisms ensuring intestinal barrier integrity and maintenance of intestinal homeostasis.Copyright © 2023 Bubeck, Becker and Patankar.

Keywords: chron’s disease; clostridioides difficile infection; inflammatory bowel disease; risk factors  ; ulcerative colıtıs
PMID: 37692651
Abstract: Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is one of the most common diseases associated with medical care, having a more significant impact on patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The latest studies have proposed a change in management for CDI in IBD patients. This study aims to perform a systematic review that explores the risk factors associated with the infection and the most optimal approach in management. Multiple databases were used for this research, including PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Cochrane Library. Studies published in the last five years in the English language were selected based on pre-established criteria. The quality assessment used was the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Review, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria in this systematic review, including literature reviews, a case and control study, and systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Based on the findings in this research, we conclude that the treatment for an initial episode of CDI in IBD patients is the use of antibiotics, vancomycin, or fidaxomicin. For episodes of recurrent CDI (rCDI), fetal microbiota transplantation should be considered. The most common risk factors associated are gut microbiota disturbances, the use of antibiotics, and hospitalization. Due to a wide range of risk factors mentioned in some studies but disregarded in others, further research is needed to determine the most prevalent risk factors.Copyright © 2023, Sangurima et al.

PMID: 37692554
Abstract: Copay cards are intended to mitigate patient out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses. This qualitative, exploratory focus group study aimed to capture patient perceptions of copay cards and copay adjustment programs (CAPs; insurers' accumulator and maximizer policies), which redirect the copay card utilization benefits intended for patients' OOP expenses.Patients with chronic conditions were recruited through Janssen's Patient Engagement Research Council program. They completed a survey and attended a live virtual session to provide feedback on copay cards.Among 33 participants (median age, 49 years [range, 24-78]), the most frequent conditions were cardiovascular-metabolic disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Patients associated copay cards with lessening financial burden, improving general and mental health, and enabling medication adherence. An impact on medication adherence was identified by 10 (63%) White and nine (100%) Black respondents. Some patients were unaware of CAPs despite having encountered them; they recommended greater copay card education and transparency about CAPs.Patients relied on copay cards to help afford their prescribed medication OOP expenses and maintain medication adherence. Use of CAPs may increase patient OOP expenses. Patients would benefit from awareness programs and industry - healthcare provider partnerships that facilitate and ensure access to copay cards.© 2023 Jannsen Scientific Affairs, LLC.

Abstract: Psoriasis is a chronic disease, which is associated with numerous genetic and environmental factors. The high prevalence of psoriasis worldwide (2-3% of the general population) and its various comorbidities lead to research on its pathogenesis. The aim of this article is to describe the current state of knowledge on the potential links between psoriasis and other diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases, uveitis, arthritis, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, fatty liver disease, dyslipidaemia, sleep apnoea, celiac disease, lymphoma, erectile dysfunction, Parkinson's disease, osteoporosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, psychiatric disorders and substance use. Further research in this area may lead to better treatment options in the future.Copyright: © 2023 Termedia Sp. z o. o.

DEBUG:root:Input text: Title: Inflammation in the proximal colon is a risk factor for the development of colorectal neoplasia in inflammatory bowel disease patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.
Keywords: IBD variants; dysplasia; right colon
PMID: 37692199
Abstract: Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased risk of developing colorectal neoplasia (CRN) in the proximal colon.To evaluate whether duration and severity of inflammation are linked to the development of CRN in this population.Retrospective, case-control chart review of patients with PSC and IBD at a tertiary care center.Disease activity was scored per colonic segment at each colonoscopy prior to the first instance of observed CRN using a modified Mayo endoscopic sub-score and histologic assessment. Patients in the CRN-positive group were compared to controls that did not.In all, 72 PSC-IBD patients with no history of CRN were identified, 13 of whom developed CRN after at least one colonoscopy at our institution. Patients in the CRN-positive group had significantly more endoscopic (p < 0.01) and histologic (p < 0.01) inflammation in the right compared to the control group prior to the development of dysplasia. There was significantly greater endoscopic inflammation in the segment of the colon with a dysplastic lesion than other segments of the colon (p = 0.018). Patients with moderate/severe lifetime endoscopic (p = 0.02) or histologic inflammation (p = 0.04) score had a lower probability of remaining free of dysplasia during follow-up. Nearly half of the patients with dysplasia had invisible lesions found on random biopsy.Endoscopic and histologic inflammation in the proximal colon are risk factors for CRN in patients with PSC-IBD. PSC-IBD patients frequently have subclinical inflammation, and these findings support the practice of regular assessment of disease activity and random biopsy of inflamed and uninflamed areas in patients with PSC with the goal of reducing inflammation to prevent the development of CRN.© The Author(s), 2023.

Keywords: COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; vaccination
PMID: 37692027
Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) one year after contracting COVID-19.The study included 38 patients - 34 men and 4 women - suffering from COVID-19 between March 15 and May 26, 2020. The median age in the group was 31 years, ranging from 22 to 67 years. The levels of neutralizing antibodies were measured at three time-points - baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. The primary endpoint was a post-infection positive result for NAbs (> 15 AU/ml; Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG quantitative test) 12 months after infection.The median level of NAbs after 12 months was 26.5 AU/ml. At the end of observation (12 months), 21 of the 38 patients had a NAb level of >15 AU/ml (positive). The median antibody half-life was 5.8 months.A high percentage of the patients maintained positive levels of antibodies 6 and 12 months after COVID-19 infection. The dynamics of the antibody level decline suggests the need for booster vaccination at least once a year.Copyright © 2023 Termedia.

PMID: 37691728
Abstract: Camp Oasis is an annual week-long camp serving children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and hosted by the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation. Youth with IBD are at increased risk for mental health challenges, with Camp Oasis potentially mitigating these risks. The aim of this study is to measure change in and predictors of social-emotional well-being and protective factors of self-worth as a result of attending Camp Oasis.Between 2012 and 2019, a voluntary survey was administered to participants and their caregivers to reflect on their perceptions of social/emotional well-being and protective factors related to chronic disease. T-tests compared change in participants' and caregivers' perceptions before and after camp; path analyses examined the key predictors of social-emotional well-being.A total of 6011 online surveys were analyzed. Participants and caregivers reported consistently positive perceptions of participants' experiences during and after camp. Significant improvements in confidence, independence, activity, comfort around others, being more open about disease, and taking medication as expected were observed. Being new to Camp Oasis was one of the strongest predictors of both disease-related self-efficacy and social connections after camp.The uniformly high rates of participants' perceptions during camp suggest camp is a life-changing experience for youth with IBD, reduces disease-related stigma, and enhances confidence and social skills. Participants' positive experiences appear to foster notable benefits after camp in terms of openness, their sense of belonging, connections, and confidence.© The Author(s) 2023.

Keywords: CDHR5; MUCDHL; brush border; colitis; microvilli
PMID: 37691494
Abstract: Intestinal epithelial cells are covered by the brush border, which consists of densely packed microvilli. The Intermicrovillar Adhesion Complex (IMAC) links the microvilli and is required for proper brush border organization. Whether microvillus crosslinking is involved in the intestinal barrier function or colitis is currently unknown. We investigate the role of microvillus crosslinking in colitis in mice with deletion of the IMAC component CDHR5. Electron microscopy shows pronounced brush border defects in CDHR5-deficient mice. The defects result in severe mucosal damage after exposure to the colitis-inducing agent DSS. DSS increases the permeability of the mucus layer and brings bacteria in direct contact with the disorganized brush border of CDHR5-deficient mice. This correlates with bacterial invasion into the epithelial cell layer which precedes epithelial apoptosis and inflammation. Single-cell RNA sequencing data of patients with ulcerative colitis reveals downregulation of CDHR5 in enterocytes of diseased areas. Our results provide experimental evidence that a combination of microvillus crosslinking defects with increased permeability of the mucus layer sensitizes to inflammatory bowel disease.© 2023 The Authors.

Keywords: endoscopic improvement; histological healing; systemic immune-inflammation index; treat-to-target; ulcerative colitis
PMID: 37691449
Abstract: The treat-to-target strategy is recommended by Selecting Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease II (STRIDE-II) for treating ulcerative colitis (UC), and monitoring remission status is crucial during this management. The systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), defined as platelet * neutrophil/lymphocyte, is a complete blood count-based index reflecting the balance of immune and inflammatory status. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of SII for diagnosing UC and monitoring UC disease activity.This study retrospectively analyzed patients with UC and controls. Relationships between SII and Mayo clinical score, Mayo Endoscopic Score (MES), and Nancy Histological Index (NHI) were evaluated.167 patients with UC and 106 controls were included. SII significantly increased in patients with UC and was closely correlated with the Mayo clinical score, MES, and NHI. SII diagnosed UC with a cut-off value of 619.1 × 109/L (area under the curve = 0.861, p < 0.0001, sensitivity 79.64%, specificity 77.36%), evaluated clinical remission status with a cut-off value of 1068 × 109/L (area under the curve = 0.691, p < 0.05, sensitivity 55.71%, specificity 81.48%), endoscopic improvement with a cut-off value of 981.3 × 109/L (area under the curve = 0.819, p < 0.0001, sensitivity 65.22%, specificity 89.66%), and histological healing with a cut-off value of 689.3 × 109/L (area under the curve = 0.898, p < 0.0001, sensitivity 88.89%, specificity 95.83%).SII is a potential biomarker for diagnosing UC and monitoring UC disease severity, especially in evaluating mucosal and histological healing during the long-term management in treat-to-target strategy. However, further research is needed to confirm its usefulness and optimize its clinical application.

Keywords: HSD; IBD; Necroptosis; RIPK3
PMID: 37691056
Abstract: Due to its unclear etiology, there is no specific medicine to cure the recurrent and incurable inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Unhealthy dietary habits unconsciously contributed to the progression of IBD, for example a High-Salt-Diet (HSD) is the most neglected and frequently adopted habit. However, the molecular mechanism of how HSD aggravates the progression of IBD has yet to remain uncovered. Herein, we focus on the hypothesis that necroptosis pathway may be involved in the process of IBD exacerbated by HSD. To this end, different gene expression (DEGs) profiles of human epithelia under hypertonic culture conditions were applied to screen candidate pathways. What's more, gene expression manipulation, immune microenvironment detection, RIPK3/MLKL gene knockout (KO), and wild-type (WT) mice were carried out to research the promotion of IBD progression under treatments of high salt intake. Based on our present results, gene expression profiles in human normal colon epithelia cell NCM460 were significantly changed under salt- or sucrose-induced hypertonic culture conditions. RIPK3 was significantly up-regulated under both conditions. Furthermore, mice colon epithelia cell CT26 growth was inhibited in a time- and dose-dependent manner by extra NaCl incubation. Autophagy, and Necroptosis pathways were activated and enhanced by LPS pretreatment. HSD significantly exacerbated DSS-induced IBD symptoms in vivo in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, RIPK3-/- and MLKL-/- mice presented severe IBD symptoms in vivo. Overall, the results demonstrated that HSD aggravated the IBD progression via necroptosis activation, providing novel strategies and promising targets for the clinical treatment of IBD.© 2023.

Keywords: Blood spinal cord barrier; Esculentoside A; MMP-9; Spinal cord injury; TLR4
PMID: 37690527
Abstract: Overexpressed MMP-9 in vascular endothelial cells is involved in blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) dysfunction in spinal cord injury (SCI). Esculentoside A (EsA) has anti-inflammatory and cell protective effects. This study aimed to evaluate its effects on neuromotor function in SCI rats, as well as the potential mechanisms.The therapeutic effect of EsA in SCI rats was investigated using Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scores, a grid walk test and histological analyses. To assess the protective role of EsA in the BSCB and in oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-induced hBMECs, the BSCB function, tight junctions (TJ) protein (ZO-1 and claudin-5) expression, structure of the BSCB and Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression were observed via Evans blue (EB) detection, immunofluorescence analyses and western blotting. Molecular docking simulations and additional experiments were performed to explore the potential mechanisms by which EsA maintains the function of the BSCB in vivo and in vitro.EsA treatment improved BBB scores, reduced cavity formation and the loss of neuronal cells, demonstrating an improvement in motor function in SCI rats. In vivo experiments showed that EsA decreased the infiltration of blood cells and inflammatory mediators (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) and protected the structure of TJs in the rat spinal cord and in OGD/R-induced hBMECs. EsA inhibited the activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signalling, which may be related to the protective effect of EsA against MMP-9-induced BSCB damage.EsA downregulated MMP-9 expression in vascular endothelial cells, protected BSCB function in SCI rats and attenuated TLR4 signalling and thus provide new options for the treatment of SCI.Copyright © 2023.

Keywords: Completion proctectomy; Immunobiologic therapy; Inflammatory bowel disease; Rectal stump; Subtotal colectomy
PMID: 37690444
Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often requires surgical resection, such as subtotal colectomy operations to alleviate symptoms. However, IBD also has an inherently increased risk of colorectal dysplasia and cancer. Despite the well-accepted surveillance guidelines for IBD patients with an intact colon, contemporaneous decision-making models on rectal stump surveillance is sparse. This study looks at the fate of rectal stumps in IBD patients following subtotal colectomy.This is a two-centre retrospective observational cohort study. Patients were identified from NHS Grampian and NHS Highland surgical IBD databases. Patients that had subtotal colectomy between January 01, 2010 and December 31, 2017 were included with the follow-up end date on April 1, 2021. Socio-demographics, diagnosis, medical and surgical management data were collected from electronic records.Of 250 patients who had subtotal colectomy procedures, only one developed a cancer in their rectal stump (0.4%) over a median follow-up of 80 months. A higher than expected 72% of patients had ongoing symptoms from their rectal stumps. Surveillance was varied and inconsistent. However, no surveillance, flexible sigmoidoscopy, or MRI identified dysplastic or neoplastic disease.Based on our results, we estimate that the prevalence of rectal cancer is lower than previously reported. Surveillance strategy of rectal stump varied as no current guidelines exist and hence is an important area for future study. Given the relatively low frequency of rectal cancer in these patients, and the low level of evidence available in this field, we would propose a registry-based approach to answering this important clinical question.© 2023 The Author(s).

Keywords: Artificial Intelligence; Convolutional Neural Network; Ranking; Ulcerative Colitis
PMID: 37690125
Abstract: Existing endoscopic scores for Ulcerative Colitis (UC) objectively categorize the disease severity based on the presence or absence of endoscopic findings. Therefore, it may not reflect the range of clinical severity within each category. However, Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) expert endoscopists categorize the severity and diagnose the overall impression of the degree of inflammation. This study aimed to develop artificial intelligence (AI) system that can accurately represent the assessment of the endoscopic severity of UC by IBD expert endoscopists.A ranking-convolutional neural network (ranking-CNN) was trained using comparative information on the UC severity of 13,826 endoscopic images pairs created by IBD expert endoscopists. Using the trained ranking-CNN, the UC Endoscopic Gradation Scale (UCEGS) was used to express severity. Correlation coefficients were calculated to ensure that there were no inconsistencies in assessments of severity made using UCEGS diagnosed by the AI and the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES), and the correlation coefficients of the mean for test images that had been assessed using UCEGS by four IBD expert endoscopists, and the AI.Spearman's correlation coefficient between the UCEGS diagnosed by AI and MES was approximately 0.89. The correlation coefficients between IBD expert endoscopists and the AI of the evaluation results were all higher than 0.95 (P<0.01).The AI developed here can diagnose UC severity endoscopically similar to IBD expert endoscopists.

Keywords: M2 macrophages; Nrf2; colitis-associated colorectal cancer; gold nanoclusters; inflammatory bowel disease; macrophage polarization; nanomedicine
PMID: 37690027
Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is one of the main factors leading to colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). Therefore, it is critical to develop an effective treatment for IBD to prevent secondary colorectal carcinogenesis. M2 macrophages play crucial roles in the resolution phase of intestinal inflammation. However, traditional drugs rarely target intestinal M2 macrophages, and they are not easily cleared. Gold nanoclusters are known for their in vivo safety and intrinsic biomedical activities. In this study, a glutathione-protected gold nanocluster is synthesized and evaluated, namely, GA. Interestingly, GA specifically accumulates in the colon during IBD. Furthermore, GA not only promotes M2 differentiation of IL-4-treated peritoneal macrophages but also reprograms macrophage polarization from M1 to M2 in a pro-inflammatory environment. Mechanistically, this regulatory effect is exerted through activating the antioxidant Nrf2 signaling pathway, but not traditional STAT6. When applied in IBD mice, we found that GA elevates M2 macrophages and alleviates IBD in an Nrf2-dependent manner, evidenced by the abolished therapeutic effect upon Nrf2 inhibitor treatment. Most importantly, GA administration significantly suppresses AOM/DSS-induced CAC, without causing obvious tissue damage, providing critical evidence for the potential application of gold nanoclusters as nanomedicine for the treatment of IBD and CAC.

DEBUG:root:Input text: Title: Detecting potential causal relationship between inflammatory bowel disease and rosacea using bi-directional Mendelian randomization.
Keywords: 
PMID: 37689807
Abstract: The association between rosacea and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been studied in previous observational studies. It is unclear, however, whether the association is causal or not. Independent genetic variants for IBD were chosen as instruments from published Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) studies involving 38,155 cases with an IBD diagnosis and 48,485 controls in order to investigate the causal effect of IBD on rosacea. Summarized data for rosacea were gathered from various GWAS studies that included 1195 cases and 211,139 controls without rosacea. Reverse-direction Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was done to investigate the relationship between genetically proxied rosacea and IBD. With the use of the inverse variance-weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, and weighted median approaches, a 2-sample Mendelian randomization study was carried out. Analysis of heterogeneity and sensitivity was performed to examine the pleiotropy and robustness of effect estimates. The forward-direction of the MR study was to reveal that genetic predisposition to IBD including its two main subtypes: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) was associated with an increased risk of rosacea. The reverse-direction MR analyses did not demonstrate that a genetic predisposition to rosacea was associated with total IBD, UC and CD. Our findings provided evidence for a causal impact of IBD, UC, and CD on rosacea, but not vice versa. The elevated incidence of rosacea in patients with IBD should be recognized by doctors to make an early diagnosis and initiate specialized therapy.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited.

Keywords: Adropin; Inflammatory bowel disease; Metabolomics; PPARγ; Polarization of macrophages
PMID: 37688913
Abstract: The aim of this study was to describe the effects of adropin deficiency on the distribution, phenotype and pathological phenotype of macrophages in colonic and mesenteric tissues of AdrKO (Enho-/-) mice, so as to explore the mechanism of adropin deficiency in spontaneous and experimental colitis. In this study, RNA-seq and metabonomics were used to screen the regulatory mechanism of adropin on the phenotypic transformation of macrophages. We found that adropin levels in active UC patients were significantly lower than those in normal subjects and remission UC patients, and at the same time, a large number of proinflammatory M1-type macrophages were infiltrated in the mesenteric tissue of colonic tissues from UC and CD patients. At the same time, spontaneous colitis occurred in Enho-/- (adropin-deficient)C57BL/6 mice, and there was an imbalance of M2 → M1 polarization of macrophages in colon and mesentery of Enho-/- mice. In vivo, it has showed that adropin deficiency could exacerbate the pathological phenotype of colitis induced by TNBS. In vitro, adropin was used to intervene RAW264.7 macrophages, and then combined analysis of RNA-seq and metabolomics demonstrated that adropin regulated lipid metabolism of macrophages through PPARγ, thus promoting the repolarization of macrophages from M1 to M2. Adropin deficiency led to an imbalance in the phenotypic distribution of macrophages infiltrating the colon and mesenteric tissues, namely, an increase in M1 type, which led to the occurrence and development of colitis.Copyright © 2023.

Keywords: 
PMID: 37688386
Abstract: This review focuses on the crucial role of the Intestinal epithelium in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and its significance in the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). NEC is a devastating neonatal disease, while IBD represents a global healthcare problem with increasing incidence. The breakdown of the intestinal barrier in neonates is considered pivotal in the development and progression of both disorders. This review provides an overview of the current state of in-vitro, ex-vivo and animal models to study epithelial injury in NEC and IBD, addressing pertinent questions that engage clinicians and researchers alike. Despite significant advancements in early recognition and aggressive treatment, no single therapy has been conclusively proven effective in reducing the severity of these disorders. Although early interventions have improved clinical outcomes, NEC and IBD continue to impose substantial morbidity, mortality and economic burdens on affected individuals and society. Consequently, exploring alternative therapeutic options capable of preventing and treating the sequelae of NEC and IBD has become a pressing necessity. In recent decades, extracellular vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a potential solution to modulate the pathogenic mechanism in these multifactorial and complex disorders. Despite the diverse array of proposed models, a comprehensive model to investigate and decelerate the progression of NEC and IBD remains to be established. To bridge the translational gap between preclinical studies and clinical applications, enhancements in the technical development of gut-on-a-chip models and EVs hold considerable promise.© The Author(s) 2023.

Keywords: inflammatory bowel disease; intestinal barrier integrity; natural products; tight junction
PMID: 37687122
Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), can affect the entire gastrointestinal tract and mucosal layer and lead to intestinal damage and intestinal dysfunction. IBD is an inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract that significantly impacts public health development. Monoclonal antibodies and other synthetic medications are currently used to treat IBD, but they are suspected of producing serious side effects and causing a number of other problems with long-term use. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that organic macromolecules from plants and animals have an alleviating effect on IBD-related problems, and many of them are also capable of altering enzymatic function, reducing oxidative stress, and inhibiting the production of cytokines and release of proinflammatory transcriptional factors. Thus, in this paper, the natural products with potential anti-IBD activities and their mechanism of action were reviewed, with a focus on the protective effects of natural products on intestinal barrier integrity and the regulation of tight junction protein expression and remodeling. In conclusion, the insights provided in the present review will be useful for further exploration and development of natural products for the treatment of IBD.

Keywords: Momordica charantia; antioxidant; extracellular vesicles; protein domain analysis; ulcerative colitis
PMID: 37687011
Abstract: Plant-derived extracellular vesicles are functional nanovesicles that have significant applications in both disease prevention and treatment, as well as for use as drug carriers. Momordica charantia is a widely consumed food that has both medicinal and nutritional properties and has shown intervention in diabetes and inflammation caused by oxidative damage. In this study, Momordica charantia-derived extracellular vesicles (MCEVs) were extracted and demonstrated to have excellent antioxidant activity by characterization, lipid composition analysis, protein domain analysis, and in vitro antioxidant measurement. In addition, in vivo studies indicated that the MCEVs could restore ulcerative colitis by regulating oxidation and inflammatory factors. Therefore, the antioxidant properties of MCEVs may be important in protecting the colon from inflammation, which provides new insights into the application of MCEVs as drugs or vectors for intervention in ulcerative colitis.

Keywords: body composition; children; inflammatory bowel disease; paraspinal muscle; psoas muscle
PMID: 37686870
Abstract: This study aimed to determine the proportion of patients with sarcopenia diagnosed by MRI and compare these results to bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA).Children with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease (CD) who had MRI enterography (MRE) and BIA and had at least 12 months of follow-up were included. Total psoas muscle area (TPMA) and total paravertebral muscle (TPVM) were measured and compared to subjects' lean mass and the lean mass body index (LMBI) was assessed by BIA.30 newly diagnosed children with CD were included (mean age 14.2 years, 53% male). Sarcopenia was found in 13 (43%) children; mean TPMA was 15.2 (1.1 SD) cm2 and TPVM 30.95 (1.7 SD) cm2. A highly positive correlation was shown for lean mass assessed by BIA and TPMA (0.706, p < 0.001) and TPVM (0.75, p < 0.001). Sarcopenia was more prevalent in boys (77% vs. 24%, p = 0.004), patients with the perianal disease (69% vs. 29%, p = 0.03), and children with sarcopenia were likely to receive anti-TNF (77% vs. 41%, p = 0.05). During the follow-up period, 16 (53%) children experienced a relapse. TPMA (HR 0.99, p = 0.018) and TPVM (HR 0.99, p = 0.031) values were statistically significant risk factors for relapse.A high proportion of patients with CD have sarcopenia at the time of the diagnosis. There is a good correlation between muscle mass assessed by MRI and BIA. Because MRI is performed in a great proportion of newly diagnosed CD patients it can also be used to assess the presence of sarcopenia.

Keywords: anemia; inflammatory bowel disease; micronutrients; nutrition; obesity; sarcopenia
PMID: 37686856
Abstract: During the disease course, most Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients present a condition of malnutrition, undernutrition, or even overnutrition. These conditions are mainly due to suboptimal nutritional intake, alterations in nutrient requirements and metabolism, malabsorption, and excessive gastrointestinal losses. A suboptimal nutritional status and low micronutrient serum levels can have a negative impact on both induction and maintenance of remission and on the quality of life of Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients. We performed a systematic review including all the studies evaluating the connection between nutrition, nutrition status (including undernutrition and overnutrition), micronutrient deficiency, and both disease course and therapeutic response in Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients. This systematic review was performed using PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus. Four main clinical settings concerning the effect of nutrition on disease course in adult Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients were analyzed (induction of remission, maintenance of remission, risk of surgery, post-operative recurrence, and surgery-related complications). Four authors independently reviewed abstracts and manuscripts for eligibility. 6077 articles were found; 762 duplicated studies were removed. Out of 412 full texts analyzed, 227 were included in the review. The evidence summarized in this review showed that many nutritional aspects could be potential targets to induce a better control of symptoms, a deeper remission, and overall improve the quality of life of Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients.

DEBUG:root:Input text: Title: The Importance of Antioxidant Activity for the Health-Promoting Effect of Lycopene.
Keywords: lycopene; neurodegenerative diseases; neuroinflammation
PMID: 37686853
Abstract: Lycopene is a compound of colored origin that shows strong antioxidant activity. The positive effect of lycopene is the result of its pleiotropic effect. The ability to neutralize free radicals via lycopene is one of the foundations of its pro-health effect, including the ability to inhibit the development of many civilization diseases. Therefore, this study focuses on the importance of the antioxidant effect of lycopene in inhibiting the development of diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diseases within the nervous system, diabetes, liver diseases, and ulcerative colitis. According to the research mentioned, lycopene supplementation has significant promise for the treatment of illnesses marked by chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. However, the majority of the supporting data for lycopene's health benefits comes from experimental research, whereas the evidence from clinical studies is both scarcer and less certain of any health benefits. Research on humans is still required to establish its effectiveness.

Keywords: DNA damage; colitic cancer; human leukocyte antigen; immune cells
PMID: 37686454
Abstract: Human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) is considered a genetic pathogen for ulcerative colitis (UC). This study aimed to investigate the significance of DNA damage and HLA-I expression in infiltrating immune cells and immune checkpoint protein PD-L1 expression in dysplasia/colitic cancer (CC) and sporadic colorectal cancer (SCRC). We performed immunohistochemical staining for HLA-I, PD-L1, γH2AX (DNA damage marker), and immune cell markers such as CD8, FOXP3, CD68, and CD163 (in surgically resected specimens from 17 SCRC patients with 12 adjacent normal mucosa (NM) and 9 UC patients with 18 dysplasia/CC tumors. The ratio of membrane HLA-I-positive epithelial cells in UC and dysplasia/CC tissues was significantly higher than that in NM and SCRC. High HLA-I expression in dysplasia/CC was associated with high positivity of γH2AX and PD-L1 expression compared to SCRC. The infiltration of CD8-positive T cells and CD68-positive macrophages in HLA-I-high dysplasia/CC was significantly higher than in UC and SCRC. Dysplasia/CC specimens with DNA damage exhibited high levels of HLA-I-positive epithelial cells with high CD8- and CD68-positive immune cell infiltration compared to UC and SCRC specimens. Targeting DNA damage in UC may regulate immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint proteins, and carcinogenesis by modulating DNA damage-induced HLA-I antigen presentation.

Keywords: NF-κB; VDUP1; inflammation; macrophage infiltration; ulcerative colitis
PMID: 37686390
Abstract: The loss of vitamin D3 upregulated protein 1 (VDUP1) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various inflammation-related diseases. Notably, reduced expression of VDUP1 has been observed in clinical specimens of ulcerative colitis (UC). However, the role of VDUP1 deficiency in colitis remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of VDUP1 in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental colitis in mice. VDUP1-deficient mice were more susceptible to DSS-induced colitis than their wild-type (WT) littermates after 2% DSS administration. VDUP1-deficient mice exhibited an increased disease activity index (DAI) and histological scores, as well as significant colonic goblet cell loss and an increase in apoptotic cells. These changes were accompanied by a significant decrease in MUC2 mRNA expression and a marked increase in proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines within damaged tissues. Furthermore, phosphorylated NF-κB p65 expression was significantly upregulated in damaged tissues in the context of VDUP1 deficiency. VDUP1 deficiency also led to significant infiltration of macrophages into the site of ulceration. An in vitro chemotaxis assay confirmed that VDUP1 deficiency enhanced bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) chemotaxis induced by CCL2. Overall, this study highlights VDUP1 as a regulator of UC pathogenesis and a potential target for the future development of therapeutic strategies.

Keywords: Crohn; Johne’s disease; biomarker; colitis; epigenetic; inflammatory bowel disease; long non-coding RNAs; mycobacter; regulation
PMID: 37686376
Abstract: Non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) have paved the way to new perspectives on the regulation of gene expression, not only in biology and medicine, but also in associated fields and technologies, ensuring advances in diagnostic means and therapeutic modalities. Critical in this multistep approach are the associations of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) with diseases and their causal genes in their networks of interactions, gene enrichment and expression analysis, associated pathways, the monitoring of the involved genes and their functional roles during disease progression from one stage to another. Studies have shown that Johne's Disease (JD), caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies partuberculosis (MAP), shares common lncRNAs, clinical findings, and other molecular entities with Crohn's Disease (CD). This has been a subject of vigorous investigation owing to the zoonotic nature of this condition, although results are still inconclusive. In this review, on one hand, the current knowledge of lncRNAs in cells is presented, focusing on the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal-related pathologies and MAP-related infections and, on the other hand, we attempt to dissect the associated genes and pathways involved. Furthermore, the recently characterized and novel lncRNAs share common pathologies with IBD and JD, including the expression, molecular networks, and dataset analysis results. These are also presented in an attempt to identify potential biomarkers pertinent to cattle and human disease phenotypes.

Keywords: IL-33; biological characteristics; gastrointestinal cancer; inflammatory bowel disease; nuclear IL-33
PMID: 37686309
Abstract: Intestinal diseases have always posed a serious threat to human health, with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) being one of them. IBD is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation, including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The "alarm" cytokine IL-33, which is intimately associated with Th2 immunity, is a highly potent inflammatory factor that is considered to have dual functions-operating as both a pro-inflammatory cytokine and a transcriptional regulator. IL-33 has been shown to play a crucial role in both the onset and development of IBD. Therefore, this review focuses on the pathogenesis of IBD, the major receptor cell types, and the activities of IL-33 in innate and adaptive immunity, as well as its underlying mechanisms and conflicting conclusions in IBD. We have also summarized different medicines targeted to IL-33-associated diseases. Furthermore, we have emphasized the role of IL-33 in gastrointestinal cancer and parasitic infections, giving novel prospective therapeutic utility in the future application of IL-33.

PMID: 37686307
Abstract: Chronic inflammation is linked to carcinogenesis, particularly in the digestive organs, i.e., the stomach, colon, and liver. The mechanism of this effect has, however, only partly been focused on. In this review, we focus on different forms of chronic hepatitis, chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and chronic gastritis, conditions predisposing individuals to the development of malignancy. Chronic inflammation may cause malignancy because (1) the cause of the chronic inflammation is itself genotoxic, (2) substances released from the inflammatory cells may be genotoxic, (3) the cell death induced by the inflammation induces a compensatory increase in proliferation with an inherent risk of mutation, (4) changes in cell composition due to inflammation may modify function, resulting in hormonal disturbances affecting cellular proliferation. The present review focuses on chronic gastritis (Helicobacter pylori or autoimmune type) since all four mechanisms may be relevant to this condition. Genotoxicity due to the hepatitis B virus is an important factor in hepatocellular cancer and viral infection can similarly be central in the etiology and malignancy of inflammatory bowel diseases. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the dominating cause of chronic gastritis and has not been shown to be genotoxic, so its carcinogenic effect is most probably due to the induction of atrophic oxyntic gastritis leading to hypergastrinemia.

Chronic inflammation may cause malignancy because (1) the cause of the chronic inflammation is itself genotoxic, (2) substances released from the inflammatory cells may be genotoxic, (3) the cell death induced by the inflammation induces a compensatory increase in proliferation with an inherent risk of mutation, (4) changes in cell composition due to inflammation may modify function, resulting in hormonal disturbances affecting cellular proliferation. The present review focuses on chronic gastritis (Helicobacter pylori or autoimmune type) since all four mechanisms may be relevant to this condition. Genotoxicity due to the hepatitis B virus is an important factor in hepatocellular cancer and viral infection can similarly be central in the etiology and malignancy of inflammatory bowel diseases. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the dominating cause of chronic gastritis and has not been shown to be genotoxic, so its carcinogenic effect is most probably due to the induction of atrophic oxyntic gastritis leading to hypergastrinemia.\\n\\n===\\n\\n"}], "max_tokens": 3000}' message='Post details'

Keywords: Crohn’s disease; biomarkers; endoscopy; inflammatory bowel disease; tumor necrosis factor inhibitors
PMID: 37685662
Abstract: Patients with Crohn's disease can present with a variety of clinical manifestations; treatment strategies should focus on long-term remission and improvement of quality of life. There is no standardized process of diagnosing, predicting prognosis, and treating the disease. This narrative review was based on a literature search using PubMed, Embase, and Science Direct. Data on unmet challenges in patients with Crohn's disease were extracted from identified manuscripts. The aim was to discuss present research on standardized processes in the management of patients with Crohn's disease and to identify the unmet needs in clinical evaluation and treatment approaches. There is no consensus on standardized diagnostic, treatment, and surveillance algorithms, particularly in assessing complications of Crohn's, such as stricturing disease, intestinal cancer risk, and cutaneous manifestations. Complications and treatment failure rates of conventional, interventional, and surgical therapy place emphasis on the need for standardized treatment algorithms, particularly in the case of acute complications of the disease. Research on standardized clinical approaches, reliable biomarkers for disease diagnosis and therapy monitoring, and new treatment agents is necessary to improve therapy and reduce complications in patients with Crohn's disease.

Keywords: Machine Learning; bioinformatics; bowel disease; microbiota
PMID: 37685376
Abstract: Human microbiota refers to the trillions of microorganisms that inhabit our bodies and have been discovered to have a substantial impact on human health and disease. By sampling the microbiota, it is possible to generate massive quantities of data for analysis using Machine Learning algorithms. In this study, we employed several modern Machine Learning techniques to predict Inflammatory Bowel Disease using raw sequence data. The dataset was obtained from NCBI preprocessed graph representations and converted into a structured form. Seven well-known Machine Learning frameworks, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbor, were used. Grid Search was employed for hyperparameter optimization. The performance of the Machine Learning models was evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, fscore, kappa, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Additionally, Mc Nemar's test was conducted to assess the statistical significance of the experiment. The data was constructed using k-mer lengths of 3, 4 and 5. The Light Gradient Boosting Machine model overperformed over other models with 67.24%, 74.63% and 76.47% accuracy for k-mer lengths of 3, 4 and 5, respectively. The LightGBM model also demonstrated the best performance in each metric. The study showed promising results predicting disease from raw sequence data. Finally, Mc Nemar's test results found statistically significant differences between different Machine Learning approaches.

PMID: 37685345
Abstract: Many veterans deployed to Gulf War areas suffer from persistent chronic diarrhea that is disabling and affects their quality of life. The causes for this condition have eluded investigators until recently and recent literature has shed light on the effect of vitamin D on the brain-gut axis. This study focused on determining clinical causes contributing to diarrhea and assessed whether reversing the identified causes, specifically vitamin D deficiency (VDD), could reduce the incidence of diarrhea in Gulf War veterans (GWVs). All patients completed a workup that included serologies (IBD, celiac), routine laboratory tests (CBC, chemistry panels, TSH, T4, CRP), cultures for enteric pathogens (C diff, bacteria, viruses, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)), and upper and lower endoscopies with histology and a trial of cholestyramine to exclude choleretic diarrhea and rifaximin for dysbiosis. A total of 4221 veterans were screened for chronic diarrhea, yielding 105 GWVs, of which 69 GWVs had irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D). Paired t-tests demonstrated that all GWVs had VDD (t-11.62, df68 and sig(2-tailed) 0.0001) (defined as a vitamin D level less than 30 ng/mL with normal ranges of 30-100 ng/mL) but no positive serologies, inflammatory markers, abnormal endoscopies, cultures, or histology to explain their persistent diarrhea. There was no correlation with age, BMI, or inflammation. Some zip codes had a higher frequency of GWVs with VDD, but the number of deployments had no impact. Treatment with vitamin D supplementation (3000-5000 units), given in the morning, based on weight, reduced the number of bowel movements per day (p < 0.0001) without causing hypercalcemia. We suggest that VDD is important in the etiology of IBS-D in GWVs and that vitamin D supplementation significantly reduces diarrhea.

PMID: 37685335
Abstract: Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are traditionally defined as the two main subtypes of inflammatory bowel disease. However, a more recent view considers IBD as a spectrum of heterogeneous phenotypes with consistent differences in clinical presentation and behaviors, likely explained by differences in underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. The etiology is still elusive, and the suggested pathogenesis is a complex interplay among genetic predisposition and abnormal immune response at the mucosal intestinal level, activated by only partially identified environmental triggers leading to altered intestinal permeability and impaired handling of gut microbiota. The undeniable continuous progress of medical therapy with more frequent shifts from traditional to more advanced modalities also underlines the actual unmet needs. We are using medications with completely different mechanisms of action, with a lack of predictive factors of outcomes and response and still an unsatisfactory rate of success. In addition, we are missing still valuable and accurate markers to predict disease progression and severity in order to avoid under- or over-treatment. In such a complex scenario, it is undoubtful that the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms may improve the management and pave the way for precision and eventually personalized medicine in these patients; however, there are still several challenges that will be the focus of this review.

Keywords: Anacardium occidentale L.; anacardic acids; carotenoids; colitis; food by-products; inflammatory bowel diseases
PMID: 37685250
Abstract: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) include Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Several studies relate eating habits to different aspects of IBD, such as progression and worsening of the clinical condition. Therefore, many natural products (NPs) such as polyphenols and carotenoids have been identified as promising agents in supporting IBD. An interesting source for obtaining bioactive NPs is the by-products of the food industry. The present study evaluated the potential beneficial effect of a standardized extract (CAE) obtained from cashew apple bagasse in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis model in mice. This was the first time that CAE had been evaluated in this experimental model. Chemical evaluation of CAE identified carotenoids (96.28 ± 0.15 mg/100 g), phenolic compounds (37.49 ± 0.64 mg/100 g), and a mixture of anacardic acids (C15:3 = 94.2 ± 0.6 mg/100 g; C15:2 = 108.4 ± 0.1 mg/100 g; C15:1 = 214.8 ± 0.2 mg/100 g). Administration of CAE (500 mg/kg, 4 days, p.o.) after DSS challenge was more effective in delaying disease progression compared with prior treatment (500 mg/kg, 30 days, p.o.), according to the disease activity index. However, no treatment strategy with CAE was able to prevent or inhibit disease progression, since all parameters evaluated (macroscopic, biochemical, and histopathological) in CAE-treated animals were similar to those observed in DSS-challenged animals. Despite the high dose (500 mg/kg), the standardized extract (CAE) did not result in an effective concentration of carotenoids. Furthermore, as some anacardic acids have been reported as histone acetyltransferases inhibitors, there could be a possible antagonistic relationship between carotenoids and anacardic acids. Complementary research will be necessary to test the hypothesis of antagonism. Thus, an optimized extract, with an even higher concentration of carotenoids, obtained from cashew apple bagasse, can be developed as a possible adjuvant food supplement for inflammatory bowel diseases.

Keywords: chronic inflammatory enteropathy; fecal metabolome; inflammatory bowel disease; lipid metabolism; low-grade intestinal T-cell lymphoma; small cell lymphoma
PMID: 37685017
Abstract: Chronic enteropathy (CE) in cats encompasses food-responsive enteropathy, chronic inflammatory enteropathy (or inflammatory bowel disease), and low-grade intestinal T-cell lymphoma. While alterations in the gut metabolome have been extensively studied in humans and dogs with gastrointestinal disorders, little is known about the specific metabolic profile of cats with CE. As lipids take part in energy storage, inflammation, and cellular structure, investigating the lipid profile in cats with CE is crucial. This study aimed to measure fecal concentrations of various fatty acids, sterols, and bile acids. Fecal samples from 56 cats with CE and 77 healthy control cats were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, targeting 12 fatty acids, 10 sterols, and 5 unconjugated bile acids. Fecal concentrations of nine targeted fatty acids and animal-derived sterols were significantly increased in cats with CE. However, fecal concentrations of plant-derived sterols were significantly decreased in cats with CE. Additionally, an increased percentage of primary bile acids was observed in a subset of cats with CE. These findings suggest the presence of lipid maldigestion, malabsorption, and inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract of cats with CE. Understanding the lipid alterations in cats with CE can provide insights into the disease mechanisms and potential future therapeutic strategies.

DEBUG:root:Input text: Title: Selenobaculum gbiensis gen. nov. sp. nov., a new bacterium isolated from the gut microbiota of a patient with Crohn's disease.
Keywords: 
PMID: 37684335
Abstract: The human gut microbiota is a complex ecology comprising approximately 10 to 100 trillion microbial cells. Most of the bacteria detected by 16s rRNA sequencing have yet to be cultured, but intensive attempts to isolate the novel bacteria have improved our knowledge of the gut microbiome composition and its roles within human host. In our culturomics study, a novel gram-negative, motile, obligately anaerobic, rod-shaped bacteria, designated as strain ICN-92133T, was isolated from a fecal sample of a 26-year-old patient with Crohn's disease. Based on the 16s rRNA sequence of strain ICN-92133T, the phylogeny analysis placed the strain into the family Selenomonadaceae, showing 93.91% similarity with the closely related Massilibacillus massiliensis strain DSM 102838T. Strain ICN-92133T exhibited a genome size of 2,679,003 bp with a GC content of 35.5% which was predicted to contain 26 potential virulence factors and five antimicrobial resistance genes. In comparative genomic analysis, strain ICN-92133T showed digital DNA-DNA Hybridization and OrthoANI values lower than 21.9% and 71.9% with the closest type strains, respectively. In addition, comparing phenotypic, biochemical, and cellular fatty acids with those of closely related strains revealed the distinctiveness of strain ICN-92133T. Based on the taxonogenomic results, strain ICN-92133T is proposed as a novel species belonging to a new genus. Therefore, we suggest the name of the new genus Selenobaculum gen. nov. within the family Selenomonadaceae and strain ICN-92133T (= KCTC 25622T = JCM 36070T) as a type strain of new species Selenobaculum gbiensis sp. nov.© 2023.

Keywords: 
PMID: 37682136
Abstract: Available literature has reported the association of Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in adults. However, only a few studies have addressed the disease in children.To ascertain the correlation of H pylori infection with IBD among children.The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the association between H pylori infection and IBD in children. We searched databases including Cochrane, EMBASE, Google Scholar, PubMed, Medline, and Web of Science to select relevant studies. Ultimately, based on predetermined inclusion criteria, we included 6 studies that met the requirements. Review Manager and Stata software were used to extract and analyze the data from the relevant studies. In the methods, we employed both qualitative and quantitative approaches for comprehensive analysis. Qualitative analysis involved describing study designs, sample characteristics, and results, while quantitative analysis involved statistical tests such as calculating pooled risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals to evaluate the association between H pylori infection and IBD in children. Lastly, by combining the results of the individual studies, our objective is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between H pylori infection and IBD in children.In totality, we involved 2236 participants that were recruited in 6 studies. We detected no significant difference in H pylori prevalence (9.8% vs 12.7%, P = .12) by comparing the children IBD group to controls. Among the IBD children, we estimated odds ratio (OR) of H pylori infection to 0.62 [(95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.34-1.12)]. In children suffering from ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD), the H pylori infection rates were higher than in those with IBD-unclassified (IBDU).When analyzed stratified by disease of study design, In CD group [OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 0.72-2.80)] (I2 = 0%, P = .64). but no significant difference in CD group.No correlation was found between H pylori infection and the occurrence of IBD in children.Copyright © 2023 the Author(s).

DEBUG:root:Input text: Title: Efficacy and Safety of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy in Fistulizing Crohn's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
Keywords: 
PMID: 37682003
Abstract: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) delivers 100% oxygen in a pressurized chamber, increasing tissue oxygen levels and regulating inflammatory pathways. Mounting evidence suggests that HBOT may be effective for inflammatory bowel disease. Our systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify the efficacy and safety of HBOT in fistulizing Crohn's disease (CD).A systematic review was conducted using the EMBASE, Web of Science, Pubmed, and Cochrane Library databases according to the "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses" criteria. Study bias was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook guidelines.Sixteen studies with 164 patients were included in the analysis. For all fistula subtypes, the pooled overall clinical response was 87% (95% CI: 0.70-0.95, I2 = 0) and the pooled clinical remission was 59% (95% CI: 0.35-0.80, I2 = 0). The overall clinical response was 89%, 84%, and 29% for perianal, enterocutaneous, and rectovaginal fistulas, respectively. On meta-regression, hours in the chamber and the number of HBOT sessions were not found to correlate with clinical response. The pooled number of adverse events was low at 51.7 per 10,000 HBOT sessions for all fistula types (95% CI: 16.8-159.3, I2 = 0). The risk of bias was observed across all studies.HBOT is a safe and potentially effective treatment option for fistulizing CD. Randomized control trials are needed to substantiate the benefit of HBOT in fistulizing CD.Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

DEBUG:root:Input text: Title: miR-369-3p Modulates Intestinal Inflammatory Response via BRCC3/NLRP3 Inflammasome Axis.
Keywords: BRCC3; NLRP3; inflammasome; miR-369-3p; microRNA
PMID: 37681916
Abstract: Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes expressed by immune cells in response to distinct stimuli that trigger inflammatory responses and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Evidence suggests a different role of inflammasome NLRP3 in IBD. NLRP3 inflammasome activation can be controlled by post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination through BRCC3. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of miR-369-3p on the expression and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes via BRCC3 regulation. After bioinformatics prediction of Brcc3 as a gene target of miR-369-3p, in vitro, we validated its modulation in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). The increase in miR-369-3p significantly reduced BRCC3 gene and protein expression. This modulation, in turn, reduced the expression of NLRP3 and blocked the recruitment of ASC adaptor protein by NLRP3. As a result, miR-369-3p reduced the activity of Caspase-1 by the inflammasome, decreasing the cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18. These results support a novel mechanism that seems to act on post-translational modification of NLRP3 inflammasome activation by BRCC3. This may be an interesting new target in the personalized treatment of inflammatory disorders, including IBD.

Keywords: IgAV; immunoglobulin A vasculitis; pediatric; ulcerative colitis; vasculitis
PMID: 37681212
Abstract: Rates of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease and biologic therapy use continue to rise. Consequently, specialists and generalists should recognize potential complications and side effects. We report the unique case of an adolescent with ulcerative colitis (UC) on vedolizumab presenting with severe abdominal pain, hematochezia, and subsequent purpura. After extensive investigation and a complex clinical course, diagnosis of atypical immunoglobulin A vasculitis was made. This is the first pediatric case of vasculitis in a patient with UC on vedolizumab and only the second reported case overall in UC. This case illustrates the emerging diagnostic challenge of distinguishing inflammatory bowel disease treatment complications from other common pediatric conditions.© 2023 The Author(s).

Keywords: common mucosal immune system; inflammatory bowel disease; lung-gut crosstalk; microbiota; respiratory disease
PMID: 37680747
Abstract: Both lung and gut belong to the common mucosal immune system (CMIS), with huge surface areas exposed to the external environment. They are the main defense organs against the invasion of pathogens and play a key role in innate and adaptive immunity. Recently, more and more evidence showed that stimulation of one organ can affect the other, as exemplified by intestinal complications during respiratory disease and vice versa, which is called lung-gut crosstalk. Intestinal microbiota plays an important role in respiratory and intestinal diseases. It is known that intestinal microbial imbalance is related to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), this imbalance could impact the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier and leads to the persistence of inflammation, however, gut microbial disturbances have also been observed in respiratory diseases such as asthma, allergy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and respiratory infection. It is not fully clarified how these disorders happened. In this review, we summarized the latest examples and possible mechanisms of lung-gut crosstalk in respiratory disease and IBD and discussed the strategy of shaping intestinal flora to treat respiratory diseases.Copyright © 2023 Du, Fu, Han, Sun, Xu, Yang and Rong.

Keywords: COVID-19; cilgavimab; inflammatory bowel disease; tixagevimab
PMID: 37680248
Abstract: Tixagevimab and cilgavimab (Evusheld) are 2 fully human monoclonal antibodies that received emergency-use authorization on December 21, 2021, for pre-exposure prophylaxis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients who are moderate-severely immunocompromised. The real-world efficacy of Evusheld in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is not known.We conducted a retrospective cohort study using TriNetX, a multi-institutional database in patients with IBD who received Evusheld compared to patients with IBD who did not receive Evusheld (12.1.2021-10.28.2022). The primary outcome was to assess the risk of COVID-19 within 6 months. One-to-one propensity score matching (PSM) was performed for demographic parameters, comorbid conditions, IBD medications, and history of COVID-19. Risk was expressed as adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).Four hundred and eight patients (0.19%) with IBD received Evusheld (mean age 58.6 ± 15.4 years old, female 47.7%) during the study period. After PSM, there was no difference in the risk (aOR 0.88, 95% CI, 0.33-2.35) of COVID-19 in the Evusheld cohort compared to the IBD control cohort. No patients required ICU care or intubation/respiratory support or were deceased in the Evusheld cohort.Our study did not show that Evusheld decreases the risk of COVID-19 in patients with IBD. Prevention of moderate-severe COVID-19 in these patients should focus on vaccination strategies and early COVID-19 therapies.© The Author(s) 2023.

Keywords: cobalamin; curcumin; folate; inflammatory bowel disease; lymphangiectasia; prebiotics; protein-losing enteropathy
PMID: 37680008
Abstract: The role of diet in the pathogenesis and treatment of chronic enteropathies (CE) in dogs is unresolved.To compare the ability of diets composed of hydrolyzed fish, rice starch, and fish oil without (HF) or with prebiotics, turmeric, and high cobalamin (HF+) against a limited ingredient diet containing mixed nonhydrolyzed antigens and oils (control) to resolve clinical signs and maintain serum cobalamin and folate concentrations in dogs with nonprotein losing CE (non-PLE). To determine the ability of hydrolyzed fish diets to support recovery and remission in dogs with PLE.Thirty-one client-owned dogs with CE: 23 non-PLE, 8 PLE.Randomized, blinded, controlled trial. Diets were fed for 2 weeks; responders continued for 12 weeks. Nonresponders were crossed over to another diet for 12 weeks. Response was determined by standardized clinical evaluation with long-term follow-up at 26 weeks. Concurrent medications were allowed in PLE.Nineteen of 23 (83%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 60%-94%) non-PLE CE responded clinically to their initial diet, with no difference between diets (P > .05). Four nonresponders responded to another diet, with sustained remission of 18/18 (100%; 95%CI, 78%-100%) at 26 weeks. Serum cobalamin concentration was increased (P < .05) and maintained by diet. Serum folate concentration decreased posttreatment (P < .05) but was restored by dietary supplementation. Hydrolyzed fish diets supported weight gain, serum albumin concentration, and recovery (P < .05) in dogs with PLE.Changing diet, independent of antigen restriction or supplemental ingredients, induced long-term remission in dogs with non-PLE CE. Serum cobalamin and folate concentrations were maintained by diet. Hydrolyzed fish diets supported clinical recovery and remission in PLE.© 2023 The Authors.

Keywords: natural products; oxidative stress; pro-inflammatory cytokine; ulcerative colitis; water-soluble propolis
PMID: 37679980
Abstract: To investigate the outcome of Chinese water-soluble propolis (WSP) on the inflammatory response and oxidative stress (OS) of colonic mucosa in rats with ulcerative colitis.Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) was employed to establish the ucerative colitis (UC) rat model. Forty-eight male rats were arbitrarily separated into six groups, namely control, UC, low-dose water-soluble propolis (L-WSP), medium-dose water-soluble propolis (M-WSP), high-dose water-soluble propolis (H-WSP), and sulfasalazine (Sulfa). In this study, we adopted a method of pre-administration and reconstruction of the model that assessed the water-soluble propolis mediated protection against DSS-induced UC rats. Moreover, we examined the body weight (BW), disease activity index (DAI), bloody stool, colon length, and intestinal mucosal injury index of rats. In addition, using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays, we assessed indicators, such as, colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-9 (IL-9), tumor necrosis factor-ɑ (TNF-ɑ), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde, and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) levels.The pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, as well as OS, was increased in the model rats. However, upon WSP intervention, both pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and OS reduced dramatically, and the therapeutic effect was dose-dependent.WSP downregulates OS by enhancing the function of endogenous antioxidant enzymes like SOD and GSH-Px, that inhibit neutrophil activity, as well as diminish pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-ɑ, IL-6, and IL-9, along with mechanisms that attenuate intestinal inflammation in UC rat model.

Forty-eight male rats were arbitrarily separated into six groups, namely control, UC, low-dose water-soluble propolis (L-WSP), medium-dose water-soluble propolis (M-WSP), high-dose water-soluble propolis (H-WSP), and sulfasalazine (Sulfa). In this study, we adopted a method of pre-administration and reconstruction of the model that assessed the water-soluble propolis mediated protection against DSS-induced UC rats. Moreover, we examined the body weight (BW), disease activity index (DAI), bloody stool, colon length, and intestinal mucosal injury index of rats. In addition, using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays, we assessed indicators, such as, colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-9 (IL-9), tumor necrosis factor-\\u0251 (TNF-\\u0251), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde, and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) levels.The pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, as well as OS, was increased in the model rats. However, upon WSP intervention, both pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and OS reduced dramatically, and the therapeutic effect was dose-dependent.WSP downregulates OS by enhancing the function of endogenous antioxidant enzymes like SOD and GSH-Px, that inhibit neutrophil activity, as well as diminish pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-\\u0251, IL-6, and IL-9, along with mechanisms that attenuate intestinal inflammation in UC rat model.\\n\\n===\\n\\n"}], "max_tokens": 3000}' message='Post details'

PMID: 37679886
Abstract: The roles of circRNA and N6-methyladenosine (m6 A) methylation in Crohn's disease (CD) have drawn much attention. Therefore, this investigation aimed to discover how the m6 A modification of circRNAs contributes to CD progression.The study performed circRNA sequencing on colon samples from four CD patients and four normal controls (NCs) to screen for dysregulated circRNAs. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to validate the candidate circRNA expression and determine its correlation to CD-associated inflammatory indicators. In vivo and in vitro investigations were conducted to examine the functions and pathways of circPRKAR1B in CD, besides investigating the m6 A modification role in circRNA expression modulation.The RNA-seq revealed that hsa_circ_0008039 (circPRKAR1B) was the most significant upregulated circRNA and was identified as the candidate circRNA for further examinations. Relative circPRKAR1B expression was significantly upregulated in CD colon tissues and closely related to CD-associated inflammatory indices. The circPRKAR1B expression and function were regulated by methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3)-mediated m6 A methylation. In vitro studies indicated that circPRKAR1B promoted pyroptosis mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome (NLRP3; nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing 3) and impaired autophagy by interacting with the RNA-binding protein (RBP) SPTBN1, (SPTBN1; spectrin beta, non-erythrocytic 1). The in vivo investigations revealed the treatment effects of si-circPRKAR1B and si-METTL3 in colitis models of IL-10-deficient mice.Our study reveals that METTL3-mediated m6 A modification of circPRKAR1B promotes Crohn's colitis by aggravating NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis via autophagy impairment in colonic epithelial cells.© 2023 The Authors.

Keywords: Curcumin; Macrophage targeting; Supramolecular nanoparticles; Ulcerative colitis; Yeast cell wall microparticles; pH/ROS dual-responsive
PMID: 37679849
Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) faces some barriers in oral therapy, such as how to safely deliver drugs to the colon and accumulate in the colon lesions. Hence, we report an advanced yeast particles system loaded with supramolecular nanoparticles with ROS scavenger (curcumin) to treat UC by reducing oxidative stress state and inflammatory response and accelerating the reprogramming of macrophages. In this study, the dual-sensitive materials are bonded on β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), the D-mannose (Man) is modified to adamantane (ADA), and then loaded with curcumin (CUR), to form a functional supramolecular nano-delivery system (Man-CUR NPs) through the host-guest interaction. To improve gastrointestinal stability and colonic accumulation of Man-CUR NPs, yeast cell wall microparticles (YPs) encapsulated Man-CUR NPs to form Man-CUR NYPs via electrostatic adsorption and vacuum extrusion technologies. As expected, the YPs showed the strong stability in complex gastrointestinal environment. In addition, the Man modified supramolecular nanoparticles demonstrated excellent targeting ability to macrophages in the in vitro cellular uptake study and the pH/ROS sensitive effect of Man-CUR NPs was confirmed by the pH/ROS-dual stimulation evaluation. They also enhanced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory model in macrophages through downregulation of pro-inflammatory factors, upregulation of anti-inflammatory factors, M2 macrophage polarization, and scavenging the excess ROS. Notably, in DSS-induced mice colitis model, Man-CUR NYPs can reduce the inflammatory responses by modulating TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways, alleviate oxidative stress by Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, promote macrophages reprogramming and improve the favorable recovery of the damaged colonic tissue. Taken together, this study not only provides strategy for "supramolecular curcumin nanoparticles with pH/ROS sensitive and multistage therapeutic effects" in "advanced yeast particles", but also provided strong theoretical support multi-effect therapy for UC.© 2023.

PMID: 37679584
Abstract: Despite being the preferred modality for treatment of colorectal cancer and diverticular disease, minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has been adopted slowly for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) due to its technical challenges. The present study aims to assess the disparities in use of MIS for patients with IBD.A retrospective analysis of the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database from October 2015 to December 2019 was conducted. Patients < 65 years of age were stratified by either private insurance or Medicaid. The primary outcome was access to MIS and secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, complications, length of stay (LOS), and total admission cost. Univariate and multivariate regression was utilized to determine the association between insurance status and outcomes.The NIS sample population included 7866 patients with private insurance and 1689 with Medicaid. Medicaid patients had lower odds of receiving MIS than private insurance patients (OR 0.85, 95% CI [0.74-0.97], p = 0.017), and experienced more postoperative genitourinary complications (OR 1.36, 95% CI [1.08-1.71], p = 0.009). In addition, LOS was longer by 1.76 days (p < 0.001) and the total cost was higher by $5043 USD (p < 0.001) in the Medicaid group. Independent predictors of receiving MIS were age < 40 years old, female sex, highest income quartile, diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, elective admission, and care at teaching hospitals.Patients with Medicaid are less likely to receive MIS, have longer lengths of stay, and incur higher costs for the surgical management of their IBD. Further investigations into disparities in inflammatory bowel disease care for Medicaid patients are warranted.© 2023.

PMID: 37679010
Abstract: Azathioprine, a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), is used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and may be continued during pregnancy. Acute cholestatic liver injury has been reported to occur with azathioprine. We aimed to examine azathioprine related cholestasis effect on pregnancy complications and outcome.We present a unique case of 6-MP-induced severe intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) that required meticulous combined therapy including plasma exchange. The symptoms resolved following 6-MP withdrawal. A literature review revealed 11 pregnancies complicated by early-induced severe ICP among women treated with azathioprine or 6-MP.We recommend weekly bile acid level tests for pregnant women treated with azathioprine or 6-MP, beginning early in the second trimester of pregnancy, and the prompt discontinuation of treatment upon establishment of an ICP diagnosis.Copyright © 2023.

Keywords: Human leukocyte antigen; Inflammatory bowel diseases; Spondyloarthritis
PMID: 37678619
Abstract: The term spondyloarthritis (SpA) encompasses a group of interrelated disorders characterised by the involvement of the musculoskeletal system as well as extra-articular manifestations like acute anterior uveitis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Likewise, IBD may present with various extraintestinal manifestations among which those involving the musculoskeletal system, namely peripheral and axial SpA are the most common. The identification of patients with both SpA and IBD is of paramount importance in clinical practice since the coexistence of these two entities has been associated with greater disability and decreased quality of life. In order to achieve an early diagnosis of IBD-SpA it is instrumental that rheumatologists seek for gastrointestinal symptoms in SpA patients and likewise that gastroenterologists seek for inflammatory musculoskeletal symptoms in patients with IBD. This narrative review aims at critically appraise the available evidence about SpA occurring in IBD patients versus IBD occurring in patients with SpA and highlight similarities and differences between the two scenarios.Copyright © 2023.

Keywords: cannabis; gastroparesis; inflammatory bowel diseases; nausea; pain disorders; vomiting
PMID: 37678488
Abstract: The synthesis and degradation of endocannabinoids, location of cannabinoid (CB) receptors, and cannabinoid mechanisms of action on immune/inflammatory, neuromuscular, and sensory functions in digestive organs are well documented. CB2 mechanisms are particularly relevant in immune and sensory functions. Increasing use of cannabinoids in the USA is impacted by social determinants of health including racial discrimination which is associated with tobacco and cannabis co-use, and combined use disorders. Several conditions associated with emesis are related to cannabinoid use, including cannabinoid hyperemesis or withdrawal, cyclic vomiting syndrome, nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Cannabinoids generally inhibit gastrointestinal motor function; yet they relieve symptoms in patients with gastroparesis and diverse nausea syndromes. Cannabinoid effects on inflammatory mechanisms have shown promise in relatively small placebo-controlled studies in reducing disease activity and abdominal pain in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Cannabinoids have been studied in disorders of motility, pain, and disorders of gut brain interaction. The CB2 receptor agonist, cannabidiol, reduced total Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index and increased ability to tolerate a meal in patients with gastroparesis appraised over 4 weeks of treatment. In contrast, predominant-pain endpoints in functional dyspepsia with normal gastric emptying were not significantly improved with cannabidiol. The CB2 agonist, olorinab, reduced abdominal pain in IBD in an open-label trial and in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome in a placebo-controlled trial. Cannabinoid mechanisms alter inflammation in pancreatic and liver diseases. In conclusion, cannabinoids, particularly agents affecting CB2 mechanisms, have potential for inflammatory, gastroparesis, and pain disorders; however, the trials require replication and further understanding of risk-benefit to enhance use of cannabinoids in gastrointestinal diseases.Copyright © 2023 AGA Institute.

DEBUG:root:Input text: Title: Intestinal proteases.
Keywords: 
PMID: 37678185
Abstract: Proteases constitute a group of enzymes that hydrolyze peptide bonds. Intestinal proteases are an integral part of gut homeostasis and digestion. This review discusses the broader classification of proteases, regulation of proteolytic activity (PA) in the intestinal tract, and how dysregulation of intestinal proteases contributes to the pathophysiology of conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and celiac disease. We also discuss recent advancements in therapeutic modulation that directly or indirectly target intestinal proteases and can be utilized to treat these illnesses.Host and microbiota derived proteases have been associated with symptoms in subsets of patients with IBS, IBD and celiac disease. Elevated PA mediates barrier dysfunction, visceral hypersensitivity as well as immune activation and inflammation. Recent mechanistic studies have revealed the nature of disease-associated proteases and mechanisms regulating their activity, particularly those driven by the microbiota. Advancements in activity-based probes have allowed novel ways of in vivo imaging of PA. Newer strategies targeting proteases include monoclonal antibodies, engineered microbiota as well as specific protease inhibitors.Significant progresses made in the detection as well as regulation of PA is likely to provide therapeutic advancements for gastrointestinal diseases.Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

PMID: 37676835
Abstract: Interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) and interleukin-17A (IL-17A) have strong pro-inflammatory activities that are involved in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy is considered a promising treatment for IBD. This study was performed to understand the role of rat Nlrp3 inflammasome, Hmgb1, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-17a) in the pathogenesis of IBD. Also, to evaluate the role of human umbilical cord blood-MSCs (hUCB-MSCs) in the management of IBD. The rats were in four groups: normal controls, indomethacin-induced IBD group, indomethacin-induced IBD rats that received phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the IBD group that received hUCB-MSCs as a treatment. The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of rat Nlrp3, Hmgb1, IL-1β, and IL-17a were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Histopathological examination of the small intestinal tissues of the studied rats was performed. There was a significant upregulation of the rat Nlrp3, IL-1β, IL-17a mRNA expression (p < 0.001 for the three parameters), and Hmgb1 (p < 0.05) in the untreated IBD group compared to the normal control group. In the MSC-treated group, IL-1β, IL-17a, and rat Nlrp3 mRNA expression significantly decreased compared to both the untreated IBD group and PBS group (p < 0.05 for all). hUCB-MSCs ameliorated IBD in rats by downregulating the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-17a) and other inflammatory mediators such as Hmgb1 and rat Nlrp3.© 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Keywords: Colitis; Gut microbiota; In vitro fermentation; Inflammation; Vitexin
PMID: 37676484
Abstract: Vitexin is one of the flavonoids in millet and has a variety of biological activities. However, the function of vitexin on colitis is not clear. This research studied the regulation of vitexin on colitis and investigated the possible mechanisms.An in vitro fermentation model was used to evaluate the regulation of vitexin on gut microbiota of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). At the same time, an acute colitis mice model induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) was used to evaluate the effects of vitexin on intestinal inflammation, barrier and gut microbiota.In this study, it was found that vitexin altered the structure of gut microbiota by decreasing harmful bacteria, such as Veillonella, Terrisporobacter, Klebsiella, Paeniclostridium, and increasing beneficial bacteria, such as Parabacteroides, Flavonifractor, Blautia after in vitro fermentation with the feces of colitis patients. Further, DSS-induced colitis mice models revealed that vitexin treatment significantly improved colitis symptoms, maintained intestinal barrier and down-regulated the expression of inflammatory factors, such as IL-1β and TNF-α. In addition, vitexin also improved the diversity of gut microbiota of colitis mice by decreasing the abundance of harmful bacteria.This research suggested that vitexin could alleviate colitis by regulating gut microbiota and attenuated gut inflammation.© 2023.

Keywords: 
PMID: 37675493
Abstract: The endocannabinoid system, which includes cannabinoid receptor 1 and 2 subtypes (CB1R and CB2R, respectively), is responsible for the onset of various pathologies including neurodegeneration, cancer, neuropathic and inflammatory pain, obesity, and inflammatory bowel disease. Given the high similarity of CB1R and CB2R, generating subtype-selective ligands is still an open challenge. In this work, the Cannabinoid Iterative Revaluation for Classification and Explanation (CIRCE) compound prediction platform has been generated based on explainable machine learning to support the design of selective CB1R and CB2R ligands. Multilayer classifiers were combined with Shapley value analysis to facilitate explainable predictions. In test calculations, CIRCE predictions reached ∼80% accuracy and structural features determining ligand predictions were rationalized. CIRCE was designed as a web-based prediction platform that is made freely available as a part of our study.

Keywords: information bottleneck; metastatic colorectal cancer; microbiome; multi-view; risk assessment
PMID: 37675425
Abstract: Imbalances in gut microbes have been implied in many human diseases, including colorectal cancer (CRC), inflammatory bowel disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, autism, and Alzheimer's disease. Compared with other human diseases, CRC is a gastrointestinal malignancy with high mortality and a high probability of metastasis. However, current studies mainly focus on the prediction of colorectal cancer while neglecting the more serious malignancy of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). In addition, high dimensionality and small samples lead to the complexity of gut microbial data, which increases the difficulty of traditional machine learning models.To address these challenges, we collected and processed 16S rRNA data and calculated abundance data from patients with non-metastatic colorectal cancer (non-mCRC) and mCRC. Different from the traditional health-disease classification strategy, we adopted a novel disease-disease classification strategy and proposed a microbiome-based multi-view convolutional variational information bottleneck (MV-CVIB).The experimental results show that MV-CVIB can effectively predict mCRC. This model can achieve AUC values above 0.9 compared to other state-of-the-art models. Not only that, MV-CVIB also achieved satisfactory predictive performance on multiple published CRC gut microbiome datasets.Finally, multiple gut microbiota analyses were used to elucidate communities and differences between mCRC and non-mCRC, and the metastatic properties of CRC were assessed by patient age and microbiota expression.Copyright © 2023 Cui, Wu, Zhang, Wang, He and Huang.

Keywords: Qingchang Suppository; active ingredients; intestinal mucosal barrier; mechanism; ulcerative colitis
PMID: 37675045
Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a refractory inflammatory bowel disease, and the outcomes of conventional therapies of UC, including 5-aminosalicylic acid, glucocorticoids, immunosuppressants, and biological agents, are not satisfied with patients and physicians with regard to adverse reactions and financial burden. The abnormality of the intestinal mucosal barrier in the pathogenesis of UC was verified. Qingchang Suppository (QCS) is an herbal preparation and is effective in treating ulcerative proctitis. The mechanism of QCS and its active ingredients have not been concluded especially in mucosal healing. This review elucidated the potential mechanism of QCS from the intestinal mucosal barrier perspective to help exploring future QCS research directions.Copyright © 2023 Shan, Liu, Liu, Yuan and Lin.

DEBUG:root:Input text: Title: Oral-gut axis as a novel biological mechanism linking periodontal disease and systemic diseases: A review.
Keywords: Gut microbiota; Oral microbiota; Periodontitis; Periodontopathic bacteria; Systemic diseases
PMID: 37674899
Abstract: Substantial evidence suggests that periodontal disease increases the risk of developing and progressing extraoral manifestations such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. The most probable causative mechanism behind this is the influx of bacteria and/or bacterial products (endotoxin) and inflammatory cytokines into the systemic circulation originating from inflamed periodontal tissues. However, recent studies have revealed that oral bacteria, especially periodontopathic bacteria, play a role in inducing dysbiosis of the gut microbiota resulting induction of gut dysbiosis-related pathology associated with systemic diseases. Conversely, the disruption of gut microbiota has been shown to have a negative impact on the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. Based on our study findings and the available literature, this review presents an overview of the relationship between periodontal disease and systemic health, highlighting the mouth-gut connection.© 2023 The Authors.

Keywords: Cronkhite-Canada syndrome; gastrointestinal polyposis; inflammatory bowel disease
PMID: 37674882
Abstract: Cronkhite-Canada syndrome (CCS) is a rare nonhereditary gastrointestinal polyposis syndrome. We illustrate a case with clinical presentation of dysgeusia, chronic diarrhea and weight loss, and endoscopic features of diffuse gastric mucosa nodularity with circumferential nodular pancolitis and a solitary colonic polyp initially mimicking inflammatory bowel disease. After multidisciplinary discussion, the diagnosis of CCS was made. The patient received steroids with resultant clinical, endoscopic, and histological improvement. We discuss the treatment and risk of neoplasia in CCS.© 2023 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. on behalf of The American College of Gastroenterology.

Keywords: Comorbidity; Crohn’s disease; Elderly; Risks; Ulcerative colitis
PMID: 37674503
Abstract: Approximately one out of every 88 seniors has inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and this is expected to increase in the future. They are more likely to have left-sided disease in ulcerative colitis, and isolated colonic disease in Crohn's disease; perianal disease is less common. Other common diagnoses in the elderly must also be considered when they initially present to a healthcare provider. Treatment of the elderly is similar to younger persons with IBD, though considerations of the increased risk of infections and malignancy must be considered when using immune modulating drugs. Whether anti-TNF therapies increase the risk of infections is not definitive, though newer biologics, including vedolizumab and ustekinumab, are thought to be safer with lower risk of adverse events. Polypharmacy and frailty are other considerations in the elderly when choosing a treatment, as frailty is associated with worse outcomes. Costs for IBD-related hospitalizations are higher in the elderly compared with younger persons. When elderly persons with IBD are cared for by a gastroenterologist, their outcomes tend to be better. However, as elderly persons with IBD continue to age, they may not have access to the same care as younger people with IBD due to deficiencies in their ability to use or access technology.© The Author(s) 2023.

Abstract: Cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Intestinal cancers may arise as a complication of IBD itself, while extra-intestinal cancers may arise due to some of the immunosuppressive therapies used to treat IBD. Colorectal cancer (CRC) and small bowel cancer risks remain elevated among persons with IBD as compared to age-and sex-matched members of the general population, and the lifetime risk of these cancers is strongly correlated to cumulative intestinal inflammatory burden. However, the cumulative risk of cancer, even among those with IBD is still low. Some studies suggest that IBD-CRC incidence has declined over the years, possibly owing to improved treatment standards and improved detection and management of early neoplastic lesions. Across studies of extra-intestinal cancers, there are generally higher incidences of melanoma, hepatobiliary cancer, and lung cancer and no higher incidences of breast cancer or prostate cancer, with equivocal risk of cervical cancer, among persons with IBD. While the relative risks of some extra-intestinal cancers are increased with treatment, the absolute risks of these cancers remain low and the decision to forego treatment in light of these risks should be carefully weighed against the increased risks of intestinal cancers and other disease-related complications with undertreated inflammatory disease. Quality improvement efforts should focus on optimized surveillance of cancers for which surveillance strategies exist (colorectal cancer, hepatobiliary cancer, cervical cancers, and skin cancers) and the development of cost-effective surveillance strategies for less common cancers associated with IBD.© The Author(s) 2023.

Keywords: Biologic; Biosimilar; Crohn’s disease; Management; Therapy; Ulcerative colitis
PMID: 37674501
Abstract: The therapeutic landscape for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has changed considerably over the past two decades, owing to the development and widespread penetration of targeted therapies, including biologics and small molecules. While some conventional treatments continue to have an important role in the management of IBD, treatment of IBD is increasingly moving towards targeted therapies given their greater efficacy and safety in comparison to conventional agents. Early introduction of these therapies-particularly in persons with Crohn's disease-combining targeted therapies with traditional anti-metabolite immunomodulators and targeting objective markers of disease activity (in addition to symptoms), have been shown to improve health outcomes and will be increasingly adopted over time. The substantially increased costs associated with targeted therapies has led to a ballooning of healthcare expenditure to treat IBD over the past 15 years. The introduction of less expensive biosimilar anti-tumour necrosis factor therapies may bend this cost curve downwards, potentially allowing for more widespread access to these medications. Newer therapies targeting different inflammatory pathways and complementary and alternative therapies (including novel diets) will continue to shape the IBD treatment landscape. More precise use of a growing number of targeted therapies in the right individuals at the right time will help minimize the development of expensive and disabling complications, which has the potential to further reduce costs and improve outcomes.© The Author(s) 2023.

Keywords: Comorbidities; Crohn’s disease; Issues affecting the IBD community; Treatment; Ulcerative colitis
PMID: 37674500
Abstract: The burden of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (i.e., associated direct and indirect costs, prevalence of disease, personal impact to the individual and to caregivers) continues to increase in Canada. The prevalence of IBD has increased since Crohn's and Colitis Canada's 2018 Impact of IBD report from an estimated 270,000 Canadians living with IBD in 2018 to an estimated 322,600 Canadians living with IBD today in 2023. Consequently, associated costs of IBD have also dramatically increased from an estimated $2.57 billion in 2018 to an estimated $5.38 billion in 2023; this increase is due to multiple factors including increased prevalence of disease, inflation, and additional identified factors (e.g., presenteeism, costs of childcare). Beyond the economic impact of IBD, these diseases have a significant impact on people living with the disease and their caregivers, including different presentations of disease, different commonly associated extra-intestinal manifestations or comorbid conditions, and different barriers to accessing care. In this supplementary issue, we review: Evolving trends in the epidemiology of IBD; updated estimates of indirect and direct costs (including out-of-pocket costs) associated with IBD; information specific to IBD in children, adolescents, and seniors; issues related to IBD pertaining to sex and gender; information specific to risks associated with COVID-19 and cancer related to IBD; an overview of current treatments for IBD; and evolving care models, including access to care.© The Author(s) 2023.

Keywords: Anxiety; Crohn’s disease; Depression; Mental health; Ulcerative colitis
PMID: 37674499
Abstract: Psychiatric disorders are 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in persons with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) than in the general population, with pooled prevalence estimates of 21% for clinical anxiety and 15% for depression. Rates are even higher when considering mental health symptoms, as nearly one-third of persons with IBD experience elevated anxiety symptoms and one-quarter experience depression symptoms. Rates of these symptoms were much higher during periods of disease activity, more common in women than men, and more common in Crohn's disease than ulcerative colitis. There is robust evidence of the detrimental effects of comorbid depression and anxiety on the subsequent course of IBD based on longitudinal studies tracking outcomes over time. However, psychiatric disorders and IBD have bidirectional effects, with each affecting risk of the other. Elevated mental health concerns have been consistently associated with greater healthcare utilization and costs related to IBD. There is some signal that low resilience in adolescence could be a risk factor for developing IBD and that enhancing resilience may improve mental health and intestinal disease outcomes in IBD. Psychological therapies used to treat anxiety and depression occurring in the context of IBD have been shown to significantly improve the quality of life for persons with IBD and reduce anxiety and depression. There is less evidence in regard to the impact of psychotropic medications on mental health or disease outcomes in persons with IBD. There is consensus, however, that mental health must be addressed as part of comprehensive IBD care for children and adults.© The Author(s) 2023.

Keywords: Crohn’s disease; Healthcare access; Healthcare utilization; Pregnancy; Ulcerative colitis
PMID: 37674498
Abstract: Sex (the physical and physiologic effects resulting from having specific combinations of sex chromosomes) and gender (sex-associated behaviours, expectations, identities, and roles) significantly affect the course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the experience of living with IBD. Sex-influenced physiologic states, like puberty, the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and andropause/menopause may also impact and be impacted by IBD. While neither Crohn's disease nor ulcerative colitis is commonly considered sex-determined illnesses, the relative incidence of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis between males and females varies over the life cycle. In terms of gender, women tend to use healthcare resources at slightly higher rates than men and are more likely to have fragmented care. Women are more commonly prescribed opioid medications and are less likely than men to undergo colectomy. Women tend to report lower quality of life and have higher indirect costs due to higher rates of disability. Women are also more likely to take on caregiver roles for children with IBD. Women with IBD are more commonly burdened with adverse mental health concerns and having poor mental health has a more profound impact on women than men. Pregnant people with active IBD have higher rates of adverse outcomes in pregnancy, made worse in regions with poor access to IBD specialist care. The majority of individuals with IBD in Canada do not have access to a pregnancy-in-IBD specialist; access to this type of care has been shown to allay fears and increase knowledge among pregnant people with IBD.© The Author(s) 2023.

Keywords: Crohn’s disease; Paediatrics; Transition; Ulcerative colitis
PMID: 37674497
Abstract: Rates of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Canadian children and adolescents are among the highest in the world, and the incidence is rising most rapidly in children under five years of age. These young children may have either a typical form of IBD with multi-factorial aetiology, or they may have a monogenic form. Despite the growing number of children in Canada living with this important chronic disease, there are few available medical therapies approved by Health Canada due to the omission of children from most clinical trials of newly developed biologics. As a result, off-label use of medications is common, and physicians have learned to use existing therapies more effectively. In addition, most Canadian children are treated in multidisciplinary, specialty clinics by physicians with extra training or experience in IBD, as well as specialist nurses, dietitians, mental health care providers and other allied health professionals. This specialized clinic approach has facilitated cutting edge research, led by Canadian clinicians and scientists, to understand the causes of IBD, the optimal use of therapies, and the best ways to treat children from a biopsychosocial perspective. Canadians are engaged in work to understand the monogenic causes of IBD; the interaction between genes, the environment, and the microbiome; and how to address the mental health concerns and medical needs of adolescents and young adults transitioning from paediatric to adult care.© The Author(s) 2023.

PMID: 37674496
Abstract: Rising compounding prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Kaplan GG, Windsor JW. The four epidemiological stages in the global evolution of inflammatory bowel disease. Nat Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2021;18:56-66.) and pandemic-exacerbated health system resource limitations have resulted in significant variability in access to high-quality, evidence-based, person-centered specialty care for Canadians living with IBD. Individuals with IBD have identified long wait times, gaps in biopsychosocial care, treatment and travel expenses, and geographic and provider variation in IBD specialty care and knowledge as some of the key barriers to access. Care delivered within integrated models of care (IMC) has shown promise related to impact on disease-related outcomes and quality of life. However, access to these models is limited within the Canadian healthcare systems and much remains to be learned about the most appropriate IMC team composition and roles. Although eHealth technologies have been leveraged to overcome some access challenges since COVID-19, more research is needed to understand how best to integrate eHealth modalities (i.e., video or telephone visits) into routine IBD care. Many individuals with IBD are satisfied with these eHealth modalities. However, not all disease assessment and monitoring can be achieved through virtual modalities. The need for access to person-centered, objective disease monitoring strategies, inclusive of point of care intestinal ultrasound, is more pressing than ever given pandemic-exacerbated restrictions in access to endoscopy and cross-sectional imaging. Supporting learning healthcare systems for IBD and research relating to the strategic use of innovative and integrative implementation strategies for evidence-based IBD care interventions are greatly needed. Data derived from this research will be essential to appropriately allocating scarce resources aimed at improving person-centred access to cost-effective IBD care.© The Author(s) 2023.

PMID: 37674495
Abstract: People living with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and their caregivers are faced with indirect and out-of-pocket costs that they would not otherwise experience. These costs impact one's ability to contribute to the economy to their fullest potential. The indirect costs of IBD in Canada are estimated to be at least $1.51 billion in 2023 and include costs associated with lost productivity resulting from a combination of missed work (absenteeism), decreased workplace productivity (presenteeism), unemployment, premature mortality, and caregiving costs. Unemployment is the largest contributor to indirect costs ($1.14 billion), followed by costs of absenteeism and presenteeism ($285 million). Caregiving costs for children with IBD are estimated to be nearly $58 million. Canadians with IBD also pay $536 million every year for care that is not covered by universal or supplemental private health insurance; this includes allied healthcare (e.g., care provided by psychologists), medication, and other supportive therapy. Combined, the indirect and out-of-pocket costs of IBD in Canada are estimated at more than $2 billion CAD in 2023. This is substantially higher than the estimate of $1.29 billion in Crohn's and Colitis Canada's 2018 Impact of IBD report with differences attributable to a combination of rising prevalence, inflation, and the addition of presenteeism and caregiving costs to the total indirect costs.© The Author(s) 2023.

PMID: 37674494
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic had a monumental impact on the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) community. At the beginning of the pandemic, knowledge on the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on IBD was lacking, especially in those with medication-suppressed immune systems. Throughout the pandemic, scientific literature exponentially expanded, resulting in clinical guidance and vaccine recommendations for individuals with IBD. Crohn's and Colitis Canada established the COVID-19 and IBD Taskforce to process and communicate rapidly transforming knowledge into guidance for individuals with IBD and their caregivers, healthcare providers, and policy makers. Recommendations at the onset of the pandemic were based on conjecture from experience of prior viruses, with a precautionary principle in mind. We now know that the risk of acquiring COVID-19 in those with IBD is the same as the general population. As with healthy populations, advanced age and comorbidities increase the risk for severe COVID-19. Individuals with IBD who are actively flaring and/or who require high doses of prednisone are susceptible to severe COVID-19 outcomes. Consequently, sustaining maintenance therapies (e.g., biologics) is recommended. A three-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine regimen in those with IBD produces a robust antibody response with a similar adverse event profile as the general population. Breakthrough infections following vaccine have been observed, particularly as the virus continues to evolve, which supports receiving a bivalent vaccine booster. Limited data exist on the impact of IBD and its therapies on long-term outcomes following COVID-19. Ongoing research is necessary to address new concerns manifesting in those with IBD throughout the evolving pandemic.© The Author(s) 2023.

Keywords: Crohn’s disease; Direct costs; Health services utilization; Ulcerative colitis
PMID: 37674493
Abstract: Healthcare utilization among people living with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Canada has shifted from inpatient management to outpatient management; fewer people with IBD are admitted to hospitals or undergo surgery, but outpatient visits have become more frequent. Although the frequency of emergency department (ED) visits among adults and seniors with IBD decreased, the frequency of ED visits among children with IBD increased. Additionally, there is variation in the utilization of IBD health services within and between provinces and across ethnocultural and sociodemographic groups. For example, First Nations individuals with IBD are more likely to be hospitalized than the general IBD population. South Asian children with Crohn's disease are hospitalized more often than their Caucasian peers at diagnosis, but not during follow-up. Immigrants to Canada who develop IBD have higher health services utilization, but a lower risk of surgery compared to individuals born in Canada. The total direct healthcare costs of IBD, including the cost of hospitalizations, ED visits, outpatient visits, endoscopy, cross-sectional imaging, and medications are rising rapidly. The direct health system and medication costs of IBD in Canada are estimated to be $3.33 billion in 2023, potentially ranging from $2.19 billion to $4.47 billion. This is an increase from an estimated $1.28 billion in 2018, likely due to sharp increases in the use of biologic therapy over the past two decades. In 2017, 50% of total direct healthcare costs can be attributed to biologic therapies; the proportion of total direct healthcare costs attributed to biologic therapies today is likely even greater.© The Author(s) 2023.

Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), consisting of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is recognized across the world, though Canada has among the highest burdens of IBD in the world. The Canadian Gastro-Intestinal Epidemiology Consortium (CanGIEC) led a six-province study that demonstrated the compounding prevalence of IBD in Canada from 400 per 100,000 in 2002 to 636 per 100,000 in 2014. The prevalence in 2023 is estimated at 825 per 100,000, meaning that over 320,000 people in Canada are living with IBD. Prevalence is forecasted to rise by 2.44% per year such that 1.1% of the population, 470,000 Canadians, will live with IBD by 2035. The overall incidence of IBD in 2023 is 30 per 100,000 person-years, indicating that over 11,000 Canadians will be newly diagnosed with IBD in 2023. Incidence is forecasted to rise by 0.58% per year up to 32.1 per 100,000 by 2035. The rising incidence of IBD is propelled by pediatric-onset IBD, which is rising by 1.23% per year from 15.6 per 100,000 in 2023 to 18.0 per 100,000 in 2035. In contrast, incidence rates among adults and seniors are relatively stable. Understanding the determinates of IBD has expanded through prospective cohort studies such as the Crohn's and Colitis Canada Genetic, Environmental, Microbial (CCC-GEM) project. Consensus recommendations towards diet, lifestyle, behavioural and environmental modifications have been proposed by international organizations with the goal of optimizing disease control and ultimately preventing the development of IBD. Despite these efforts, Canadian healthcare systems will need to prepare for the rising number of people living with IBD.© The Author(s) 2023.

The overall incidence of IBD in 2023 is 30 per 100,000 person-years, indicating that over 11,000 Canadians will be newly diagnosed with IBD in 2023. Incidence is forecasted to rise by 0.58% per year up to 32.1 per 100,000 by 2035. The rising incidence of IBD is propelled by pediatric-onset IBD, which is rising by 1.23% per year from 15.6 per 100,000 in 2023 to 18.0 per 100,000 in 2035. In contrast, incidence rates among adults and seniors are relatively stable. Understanding the determinates of IBD has expanded through prospective cohort studies such as the Crohn\'s and Colitis Canada Genetic, Environmental, Microbial (CCC-GEM) project. Consensus recommendations towards diet, lifestyle, behavioural and environmental modifications have been proposed by international organizations with the goal of optimizing disease control and ultimately preventing the development of IBD. Despite these efforts, Canadian healthcare systems will need to prepare for the rising number of people living with IBD.\\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.

DEBUG:root:Input text: Title: Structure shows that the BIR2 domain of E3 ligase XIAP binds across the RIPK2 kinase dimer interface.
Keywords: 
PMID: 37673444
Abstract: RIPK2 is an essential adaptor for NOD signalling and its kinase domain is a drug target for NOD-related diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease. However, recent work indicates that the phosphorylation activity of RIPK2 is dispensable for signalling and that inhibitors of both RIPK2 activity and RIPK2 ubiquitination prevent the essential interaction between RIPK2 and the BIR2 domain of XIAP, the key RIPK2 ubiquitin E3 ligase. Moreover, XIAP BIR2 antagonists also block this interaction. To reveal the molecular mechanisms involved, we combined native mass spectrometry, NMR, and cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of the RIPK2 kinase BIR2 domain complex and validated the interface with in cellulo assays. The structure shows that BIR2 binds across the RIPK2 kinase antiparallel dimer and provides an explanation for both inhibitory mechanisms. It also highlights why phosphorylation of the kinase activation loop is dispensable for signalling while revealing the structural role of RIPK2-K209 residue in the RIPK2-XIAP BIR2 interaction. Our results clarify the features of the RIPK2 conformation essential for its role as a scaffold protein for ubiquitination.© 2023 Lethier et al.

DEBUG:root:Input text: Title: Lower magnitude and faster waning of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in anti-TNF-α-treated IBD patients are linked to lack of activation and expansion of cTfh1 cells and impaired B memory cell formation.
Keywords: B memory cells; Immune response; Immunosuppression; Inflammatory bowel disease; SARS-CoV-2 vaccination; T follicular helper cells
PMID: 37672867
Abstract: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and healthy controls received primary SARS-CoV-2-mRNA vaccination and a booster after six months. Anti-TNF-α-treated patients showed significantly lower antibody (Ab) levels and faster waning than α4β7-integrin-antagonist recipients and controls. This prospective cohort study aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms on the basis of circulating T-follicular helper cells (cTfh) and B memory cells.We measured SARS-CoV-2- Wuhan and Omicron specific Abs, B- and T-cell subsets at baseline and kinetics of Spike (S)-specific B memory cells along with distributions of activated cTfh subsets before and after primary and booster vaccination.Lower and faster waning of Ab levels in anti-TNF-α treated IBD patients was associated with low numbers of total and naïve B cells vs. expanded plasmablasts prior to vaccination. Along with their low Ab levels against Wuhan and Omicron VOCs, reduced S-specific B memory cells were identified after the 2nd dose which declined to non-detectable after 6 months. In contrast, IBD patients with α4β7-integrin-antagonists and controls mounted and retained high Ab levels after the 2nd dose, which was associated with a pronounced increase in S-specific B memory cells that were maintained or expanded up to 6 months. Booster vaccination led to a strong increase of Abs with neutralizing capacity and S-specific B memory cells in these groups, which was not the case in anti-TNF-α treated IBD patients. Of note, Ab levels and S-specific B memory cells in particular post-booster correlated with the activation of cTfh1 cells after primary vaccination.The reduced magnitude, persistence and neutralization capacity of SARS-CoV-2 specific Abs after vaccination in anti-TNF-α-treated IBD patients were associated with impaired formation and maintenance of S-specific B memory cells, likely due to absent cTfh1 activation leading to extra-follicular immune responses and diminished B memory cell diversification. These observations have implications for patient-tailored vaccination schedules/vaccines in anti-TNF-α-treated patients, irrespective of their underlying disease.The study was funded by third party funding of the Institute of Specific Prophylaxis and Tropical Medicine at the Medical University Vienna. The funders had no role in study design, data collection, data analyses, interpretation, or writing of report.Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Keywords: Depressive behavior; IBD; Immunomodulators; Licorice; Liquiritin apioside
PMID: 37672855
Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a significant global health concern that can lead to depression in affected patients. Liquiritin apioside (LA) possesses anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. However, its anti-inflammatory mechanism in IBD has not been extensively studied.This study elucidates the pivotal role of LA in alleviating inflammation by regulating gut metabiota-derived metabolites and evaluating its regulative effects on promoting a balance of Th17/Treg cells in colitis mice.To evaluate the effect of LA on IBD,16S rRNA gene sequencing and UPLC-QTOF-MS analysis were used to identify the changes of intestinal bacteria and their metabolites. Cytokines levels were determined by ELISA and qPCR, while immune cell ratios were evaluated via flow cytometry.Our findings revealed that LA treatment ameliorated general states of DSS-induced colitis mice and their accompanying depressive behaviors. Moreover, LA restricted the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and revised the imbalanced Treg/Th17 differentiation, while promoting SCFAs production in inflamed colon tissues. Fecal microbiota transplantation from LA-fed mice also corrected the imbalanced Treg/Th17 differentiation, indicating that LA-mediated restoration of the colonic Treg/Th17 balance mainly depends on the changes in gut metabolites.These results provide scientific evidence explaining the apparent paradox of low bioavailability and high bioactivity in polyphenols, and suggesting that LA could be used as a potential dietary supplement for the prevention and improvement of IBD.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier GmbH.

Keywords: Crohn’s disease; multidisciplinary team; pathology; ulcerative colitis
PMID: 37672726
Abstract: Multidisciplinary teams (MDT) aid the diagnosis and management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and improve patient outcomes. The direct impact of a gastrointestinal expert pathologist on MDT care of IBD patients is unknown.A retrospective chart review was conducted evaluating all cases (N = 289) discussed at the IBD MDT conference at Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital from June 1, 2013, through December 31, 2019. Cases were discussed between 1 and 6 times at the conference. Data collected included demographics, diagnosis before and after conference, reason for diagnostic change, endoscopy findings, medications, surgeries, and clinical follow-up.Approximately 15% to 42% of patients had a change in diagnosis after the first 3 conferences. The majority of diagnostic changes after the first (84%), second (73%), and third (67%) conferences were due to expert pathologist interpretation. Indeterminate colitis was the most frequently changed diagnosis, and Crohn's disease was the most common new diagnosis after conference. Among patients with a diagnostic change, 28.6% to 38.5% of patients had a change in their IBD medication regimen, and 7.7% to 10.9% had a surgical intervention after the first 2 conferences. Approximately 54.2% to 60% of patients reported clinical improvement or remission within 6 months of the first 3 conferences.The majority of diagnostic changes made at the multidisciplinary IBD conference were due to histopathologic re-interpretation. A change in diagnosis at times led to significant modifications in medical or surgical management. An expert gastrointestinal pathologist is an essential MDT member for IBD management.© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

The direct impact of a gastrointestinal expert pathologist on MDT care of IBD patients is unknown.A retrospective chart review was conducted evaluating all cases (N\\u2005=\\u2005289) discussed at the IBD MDT conference at Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital from June 1, 2013, through December 31, 2019. Cases were discussed between 1 and 6 times at the conference. Data collected included demographics, diagnosis before and after conference, reason for diagnostic change, endoscopy findings, medications, surgeries, and clinical follow-up.Approximately 15% to 42% of patients had a change in diagnosis after the first 3 conferences. The majority of diagnostic changes after the first (84%), second (73%), and third (67%) conferences were due to expert pathologist interpretation. Indeterminate colitis was the most frequently changed diagnosis, and Crohn\'s disease was the most common new diagnosis after conference. Among patients with a diagnostic change, 28.6% to 38.5% of patients had a change in their IBD medication regimen, and 7.7% to 10.9% had a surgical intervention after the first 2 conferences. Approximately 54.2% to 60% of patients reported clinical improvement or remission within 6 months of the first 3 conferences.The majority of diagnostic changes made at the multidisciplinary IBD conference were due to histopathologic re-interpretation. A change in diagnosis at times led to significant modifications in medical or surgical management. An expert gastrointestinal pathologist is an essential MDT member for IBD management.\\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Crohn\\u2019s & Colitis Foundation.

Keywords: Crohn’s disease; biologics; fistulizing; infliximab; perianal disease; perianal fistula
PMID: 37672347
Abstract: Perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease (CD) represents a severe phenotype of CD that is associated with significant morbidity and reduction in quality of life. Perianal fistulizing CD is caused by a complex interplay of genetic predisposition, immune dysregulation, gut dysbiosis, and various unknown physiological and mechanical factors. A multidisciplinary approach is hence required for optimal management . A detailed anatomical description and classification of perianal fistula, including comprehensive clinical, endoscopic, and radiological diagnostic workup, is an important prerequisite to treatment. For simple perianal fistulas, use of antibiotics and immunomodulators, with or without fistulotomy, are appropriate measures. The medical management of complex perianal fistula, on the other hand, requires adequate control of infection before initiation of therapy with immunomodulators. In active complex perianal fistula, anti-tumor necrosis factors remain the most accepted therapy, with concomitant use of antibiotics or immunomodulators enhancing the efficacy. For patients refractory to anti-tumor necrosis factors, treatment with anti-integrins, anti-interleukins, and small molecules is being evaluated. Mesenchymal stem cells, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and exclusive enteral nutrition have also been investigated as adjunct therapies. Despite the expansion of the medical armamentarium, a large proportion of the patients require surgical interventions. In this review, we provide an up-to-date overview of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and medical management of perianal fistulizing CD. A brief overview of the surgical management of perianal fistulizing CD is also provided.© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

PMID: 37672272
Abstract: A key objective in contemporary surgery is to reduce or eliminate the usage of opioids to minimize gastrointestinal adverse effects, fatigue, and long-term opioid dependency.To evaluate the association of the implementation of a care bundle of 3 opioid-sparing interventions with the amount of opioids consumed postoperatively among patients undergoing major abdominal surgery and to examine the respective associations of the 3 components.This retrospective cohort study was performed at Ersta Hospital, an elective teaching hospital in Stockholm, Sweden. All patients undergoing major colorectal surgery between January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2019, were included. Data analysis was conducted from February 1, 2020, to May 30, 2022.A care bundle consisting of an individualized opioid regimen, regular gabapentinoids, and clonidine as a rescue analgesic was gradually introduced early in the study period.Amount of in-hospital administered intravenous and oral opioids on the day of surgery and the first 5 postoperative days (morphine milligram equivalents [MME]). The association between exposure and outcome was examined using multivariable linear regression.Overall, 842 patients had major colorectal surgery in the study period (mean [SD] age, 64.6 [15.5] years; 421 [50%] men). Median (range) opioid usage decreased from 75 (0-796) MME in 2016 to 22 (0-362) MME in 2019 (P < .001), and the proportion of patients receiving 45 MME or less increased from 35% to 66% (P < .001). On multivariable analysis (F5, 836 = 57.5; P < .001), an individualized opioid strategy (β = -11.6; SE = 3.8; P = .003), the use of gabapentin (β = -39.1; SE = 4.5; P < .001), and increasing age (β = -1.0; SE = 0.11; P < .001) were associated with less opioid consumption, while the use of clonidine was associated with more opioid intake (β = 11.6; SE = 3.6; P = .001).In this cohort study of 842 patients undergoing colorectal surgery, a care bundle consisting of an individualized opioid regimen, regular gabapentin, and clonidine as a rescue analgesic was found to be associated with a significant decrease in opioids consumed postoperatively. Regular gabapentin and an individualized opioid regimen were particularly strongly associated with this decrease and should be further evaluated as components of multimodal, opioid-free postoperative analgesia.

Keywords: anemia; chronic kidney disease; inflammatory bowel disease; iron; microbiome
PMID: 37671923
Abstract: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a leading global health concern affecting approximately 30% of the population. Treatment for IDA consists of replenishment of iron stores, either by oral or intravenous (IV) supplementation. There is a complex bidirectional interplay between the gut microbiota, the host's iron status, and dietary iron availability. Dietary iron deficiency and supplementation can influence the gut microbiome; however, the effect of IV iron on the gut microbiome is unknown. We studied how commonly used IV iron preparations, ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) and ferric derisomaltose (FDI), affected the gut microbiome in female iron-deficient anemic mice. At the phylum level, vehicle-treated mice showed an expansion in Verrucomicrobia, mostly because of the increased abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, along with contraction in Firmicutes, resulting in a lower Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio (indicator of dysbiosis). Treatment with either FCM or FDI restored the microbiome such that Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla. Interestingly, the phyla Proteobacteria and several members of Bacteroidetes (e.g., Alistipes) were expanded in mice treated with FCM compared to those treated with FDI. In contrast, several Clostridia class members were expanded in mice treated with FDI compared to FCM (e.g., Dorea spp., Eubacterium). Our data demonstrate that IV iron increases gut microbiome diversity independently of the iron preparation used; however, differences exist between FCM and FDI treatments. In conclusion, replenishing iron stores with IV iron preparations in clinical conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease or chronic kidney disease, could affect gut microbiome composition and consequently contribute to an altered disease outcome.Copyright 2023 The Author(s).

Keywords: (ibd) inflammatory bowel disease; crohn’s disease (cd); nafld; nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld); nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; risk factors for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; ulcerative colitis (uc)
PMID: 37671212
Abstract: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are inflammatory bowel diseases that have been associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This systematic review aimed to examine whether Crohn's disease confers a greater risk for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease compared to ulcerative colitis. A comprehensive search of electronic databases from January 2000 to May 2023 was conducted to identify observational studies investigating the association between Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 2020 checklist ensured transparent reporting, and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess study quality. Data synthesis revealed higher nonalcoholic fatty liver disease prevalence among Crohn's disease patients compared to ulcerative colitis patients across regions. Ten studies published between 2016 and 2022, encompassing a total of 4164 participants from three continents, were included in the review. The median proportion of Crohn's disease patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease was 37.22% (range: 10.95-53.80%), while it was 27.55% (range: 8.60-46.20%) for ulcerative colitis patients. Subgroup analysis by region confirmed CD's higher NAFLD risk. Median proportions for CD patients who developed NAFLD from North America, Europe, and Asia were 25.97% (range: 14.6-37.33%), 47.01% (range: 14.2-53.8%), and 20.78% (range: 10.95-30.6%), respectively, and the median proportion of persons with UC who developed NAFLD in studies from North America, Europe, and Asia were 17.28% (range: 8.6-25.96%), 37.70% (range: 25.64-46.20%), and 19.52% (range: 10.14-28.90%), respectively. Variations suggest differing mechanisms, disease features, and therapeutics. Transmural inflammation in Crohn's disease may increase metabolic abnormalities, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Geographic differences in lifestyle, genetics, and environmental variables may also contribute. This review demonstrates that Crohn's disease patients face a higher nonalcoholic fatty liver disease risk than ulcerative colitis patients, emphasizing the need for early monitoring and prevention. Further studies are warranted to understand mechanisms and develop tailored management approaches.Copyright © 2023, Kodali et al.

Keywords: case-control study; inflammatory bowel disease; oral health problems; quality of life; questionnaire
PMID: 37670508
Abstract: To assess whether oral health problems affect disease-specific quality of life (QoL) of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, and vice versa, whether IBD affects oral-health-related QoL.Individuals reporting IBD and matched controls were surveyed on general anamnestic information, oral-health-related questions and the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP)-5. IBD patients were additionally surveyed on years since diagnosis, disease activity and severity as well as health-related QoL (Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, sIBDQ). OHIP-5 and sIBDQ were defined as primary outcome parameters, and several predictors and confounders were used in adjusted univariable and multivariable regression analyses.Answers from 1108 IBD patients and 3429 controls were analysed. Compared with controls, IBD patients reported significantly more frequently an oral impact on daily life and worse oral-health-related QoL, with Crohn's disease (CD) patients being more severely affected than ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. The diagnosis of UC and CD, having <20 teeth, severe periodontitis and stressful daily-life experience were associated with a higher prevalence of poor oral-health-related QoL. Among IBD patients, an impaired IBD-specific, health-related QoL was significantly associated with the diagnosis of CD and depression, IBD activity and severity, having <20 teeth, presence of oral lesions and stressful daily-life experience, while a longer time since diagnosis was significantly associated with an improved IBD-specific, health-related QoL.The results of the present study indicate, for the first time, that oral health problems are associated with an impairment of IBD-specific health-related QoL, and vice versa, IBD is associated with an impaired oral health-related QoL. This emphasizes the potential advantages of including dental professionals in the multi-disciplinary treatment teams of IBD patients.© 2023 The Authors.

PMID: 37670487
Abstract: The accumulation of multiple randomized controlled trials in the field of inflammatory bowel diseases provides an opportunity to compare treatment effects between phase 2 and 3 trials. We aimed to determine whether treatment effects observed in phase 3 investigating biologics and small molecule drugs differed from those in their preceding phase 2 trial.We first performed a review of phase 2 and phase 3 trials enrolling ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) patients. We compared the percent overall success for key endpoints between phases (several phase 3 could be matched to a single phase 2 trial). Then, we compared the percent overall success in the matched phase 2 and 3 trials (ratio 1:1), and performed sensitivity analysis.We identified 14 phase 2 (8 CD; 6 UC) and 24 phase 3 (13 CD; 11 UC) trials. In CD, the different analyses suggest that the percentage of overall success of clinical remission and clinical response was significantly higher in phase 2 than in phase 3 trials. In UC, the analyses suggest collectively that the percent of treatment effect seemed similar for clinical remission, clinical response and histologic outcomes between phases but with a lower percentage of overall success in phase 2 than in phase 3 trials for endoscopic endpoints.In UC, we observed a similar percentage of treatment effect for clinical and histologic outcomes between phase 2 and 3 trials but not for endoscopic outcomes. Whereas in CD, we showed a failure to reproduce similar results between phases. These results may help sponsors in the design of future drug development programs.© 2023 The Authors.

Keywords: 
PMID: 37670196
Abstract: Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are at increased risk of pancreatitis. Data from a global safety database (GSD) were queried to identify risk factors for pancreatitis in vedolizumab-treated patients with IBD.Takeda's GSD was retrospectively queried for case reports (CRs) of adverse events (AEs) following vedolizumab treatment, from licensure (May 20, 2014) through March 31, 2021. Unsolicited and solicited CRs of pancreatitis were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) High-Level Term "Acute and chronic pancreatitis." To examine factors associated with severe pancreatitis, serious CRs (serious AEs [SAEs]) were compared with SAEs from a comparator group of 600 random non-pancreatitis AEs. Comparisons were performed using t, χ2, and Fisher's exact tests. Logistic regression was performed to adjust for covariates allowing backward selection.In total, 196 patients reported pancreatitis in > 700,000 patient-years of vedolizumab exposure. Pancreatitis was serious in 195 patients (99.5%), and non-pancreatitis AEs were serious in 195 of 600 (32.5%) in the random comparator group. In the pancreatitis group, 17 patients (8.7%) had a known history of pancreatitis versus none in the random comparator group. Younger age, vedolizumab indication of ulcerative colitis, concomitant medications (with a risk for pancreatitis), pancreatitis history, and comorbid conditions (especially ongoing pancreatitis) were associated with development of severe pancreatitis.These analyses identified factors associated with pancreatitis SAEs in patients with IBD treated with vedolizumab, but do not suggest an increased risk of pancreatitis with vedolizumab. These findings will help inform which patients treated for IBD might have an elevated risk, regardless of treatment.© 2023. The Author(s).

PMID: 37670170
Abstract: Stellaria alsine has traditionally been used as both a famine relief food and an alternative medicine in East Asia. Modern pharmacological studies have revealed that S. alsine has various biological effects such as anticancer, anti-hepatoma, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative effects. However, the anti-inflammatory properties of chemical constituents derived from this plant have not been studied well.To identify potential therapeutic candidate for treating inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).The distribution of chemical compounds was investigated by Global Natural Product Social (GNPS)-based molecular networking (MN) analysis using UPLC-Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects of S. alsine extracts and fractions were evaluated by measuring interleukin (IL)-8 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) productions.The active EA layer of S. alsine showed the highest percentage of major compounds by feature-based molecular networking. The top candidate structures of EA fraction were rapidly annotated as flavone C- or O-glycosides via an advanced analysis tool, Network Annotation Propagation (NAP). With the GNPS molecular networking-guided isolation strategy, a new C-glycosyl flavone rotamer (1) was isolated. The structures of the major (1a) and minor (1b) rotational isomers were determined by extensive NMR analysis and MS/MS fragmentation. Finally, the anti-inflammatory activity of 1 was predicted by molecular docking simulations with IL-8 protein.These results suggested that the compound 1 is a potential therapeutic candidate for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).© 2023.

PMID: 37669965
Abstract: Zinc and plant-derived ligands of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) are dietary components affecting intestinal epithelial barrier function. Here, we explore whether zinc and the AHR pathway are linked. We show that dietary supplementation with an AHR pre-ligand offers protection against inflammatory bowel disease in a mouse model while protection fails in mice lacking AHR in the intestinal epithelium. AHR agonist treatment is also ineffective in mice fed zinc depleted diet. In human ileum organoids and Caco-2 cells, AHR activation increases total cellular zinc and cytosolic free Zn2+ concentrations through transcription of genes for zinc importers. Tight junction proteins are upregulated through zinc inhibition of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer and calpain activity. Our data show that AHR activation by plant-derived dietary ligands improves gut barrier function at least partly via zinc-dependent cellular pathways, suggesting that combined dietary supplementation with AHR ligands and zinc might be effective in preventing inflammatory gut disorders.© 2023.

Keywords: cell biology; epigenetic; immunology; inflammation; intestinal epithelia
PMID: 37669386
Abstract: DNA methylation functions as a repressive epigenetic mark that can be reversed by the Ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of DNA dioxygenases that sequentially oxidize 5-methylcytosine into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). Both 5fC and 5caC can be excised by DNA base-excision repair factors leading to unmodified cytosines. TET enzymes were recently implicated as potential risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the contribution of TET-mediated DNA oxidation to intestinal homeostasis and response to environmental stressors are unknown. Here, we show prominent roles of TET3 in regulating mouse intestinal epithelial differentiation and response to luminal stressors. Compared with wild-type littermates, mice with intestinal epithelial cell-specific ablation of Tet3 (Tet3ΔIEC) demonstrated a decreased transcriptome involved in innate immune response, Paneth cell differentiation, and epithelial regeneration. Tet3IEC mice exhibited an elevated susceptibility to enteric pathogen infection that is correlated with a decreased epithelial 5hmC abundance. Infection of human enterocytes or mice with the pathogenic bacteria acutely increased 5hmC abundance. Genome-wide 5hmC profiling revealed a shift of genomic enrichment of 5hmC toward genes involved in activating Notch, Wnt, and autophagy pathways. Furthermore, chemical stressor dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) represses epithelial 5hmC abundance in a temporal fashion, and Tet3IEC mice exhibited increased susceptibility to DSS experimental colitis with reduced regenerative capacity. TET3 is a critical regulator of gut epithelial DNA methylome and transcriptome, especially in response to luminal stressors, for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis.

PMID: 37669127
Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), pathologically known as chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, is among the diseases with a high burden worldwide. Ghrelin and obestatin, as adipocytokines mainly in adipose tissues, are involved in immune responses and inflammatory pathways. Studies have assessed the circulatory ghrelin levels in patients with IBD. Herein, we aim to pool these studies through systematic review and meta-analysis.Four international databases, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Web of Science were systematically searched for studies assessing ghrelin or obestatin levels in patients with IBD (either Crohn's disease [CD] or ulcerative colitis [UC]) in active phase or in remission. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted in order to calculate the pooled estimate using the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI).Nineteen studies were included in our systematic review, comprising 1064 patients with IBD (476 UC and 588 CD). A meta-analysis of 11 studies for comparison of active and quiescent disease showed that patients with active IBD had significantly higher levels of ghrelin (SMD, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.06 to 1.34; P = .03). However, in separate analyses for UC or CD, no such difference was observed (SMD, 1.30; 95% CI, -0.28 to 2.88, P = .11; and SMD, 0.80; 95% CI, -0.41 to 2.01; P = .20, respectively). No significant difference was also observed in ghrelin levels between patients with active IBD and healthy control subjects. Obestatin levels also were not different between patients with active disease and those in remission (SMD, 0.31; 95% CI, -0.05 to 0.68; P = .09). On the other hand, the obestatin/ghrelin ratio was significantly lower in patients with active IBD (SMD, -1.90; 95% CI, -2.45 to -1.35; P < .01).Our results demonstrate that IBD patients with active disease have higher levels of ghrelin, which needs to be confirmed in future studies. Also, the obestatin/ghrelin ratio might be a promising biomarker for the assessment of disease activity.© The Author(s) 2023.

Keywords: 
PMID: 37668549
Abstract: With an increasing incidence worldwide, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the gastrointestinal tract, which impairs the life quality of patients. Therefore, it is of great significance to construct a sensitive, simple, and convenient biosensor to analyze IBD-associated biomarkers for an auxiliary diagnosis of IBD. Intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP), expressed by the intestinal epithelium, is an endogenous protein that is thought to play a vital role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and is considered a potential biomarker for IBD. Here, an IAP detection method was developed using pregnancy test strips by dephosphorylation. Initially, a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) was designed to respond to IAP and acted as an activator of Cas12a. In the presence of IAP, the designed dsDNA was not digested by lambda exonuclease (λ exo), which hybridized to the Cas12a-crRNA duplex and resulted in the activation of the trans-cleavage of Cas12a. Further, the activated Cas12a cleaved the single-strand DNA (ssDNA) linker in the MBs-ssDNA-hCG probe, triggering the release of hCG. With magnetic separation, the released hCG could be quantitatively detected by pregnancy test strips. IAP levels were analyzed in feces from colitis and healthy mice by pregnancy test strips. The results showed that the IAP level of colitis mice (3.89 ± 1.92 U/L) was much lower than that of healthy mice (39.64 ± 24.93 U/L), indicating the correlation between IAP and intestinal inflammation. Taken together, a sensitive, user-friendly detection assay based on pregnancy test strips was constructed to monitor IAP and used as an auxiliary diagnostic approach for IBD in a clinical scene.

Keywords: 
PMID: 37668427
Abstract: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) inhibitors and the α4β7 integrin antagonist, vedolizumab, have been investigated as treatment options for patients with steroid-refractory microscopic colitis.To evaluate the benefit of vedolizumab and TNF-α inhibitors in patients with steroid-refractory microscopic colitis.Retrospective studies and case series involving patients with steroid-refractory MC who either received vedolizumab, adalimumab, or infliximab were eligible for inclusion. Pooled proportional meta-analyses were used to calculate the rate of clinical remission at induction, clinical response, maintenance of remission, histologic remission, and overall medication related adverse effects. Statistical analysis was performed in R using the metafor and meta packages.A total of 14 studies involving 164 patients were included. Pooled analysis showed a clinical remission rate of 63.5% [95% CI (0.483; 0.776), I2=43% P=0.08], 57.8% [95% CI (0.3895; 0.7571), I2=0%, P=0.7541], and 39.3% [95% CI (0.0814; 0.7492), I2=66%, P=0.02] for vedolizumab, infliximab, and adalimumab, respectively. The maintenance of remission rates were 65.9% [95% CI (0.389; 0.889), I2=67%, P=0.02], 45.3% [95% CI (0.1479; 0.7747), I2=0%, P=0.36] and 32.5% [95% CI (0.000; 0.8508), I2=53%, P=0.14] in patients who received vedolizumab, infliximab, and adalimumab, respectively. Rate of biological-related adverse events warranting discontinuation of therapy was 12.2%, 32.9%, and 23.0% for the vedolizumab, infliximab, and adalimumab groups, respectively.Vedolizumab and anti-TNF-α agents demonstrated a clinical benefit in the treatment of steroid-refractory microscopic colitis and with a tolerable safety profile. Future randomized controlled trials are needed to compare vedolizumab with TNF-α inhibitors and examine treatment effect on patients' quality of life.Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Keywords: Cancer; abdominoperineal resection; inflammatory bowel disease; mucinous; squamous cell carcinoma
PMID: 37668063
Abstract: Crohn's disease patients frequently develop perianal fistulas during their life. They are also at higher risk to develop cancers. Rarely, those cancers appear within a prior chronic fistula. The main types are adenocarcinoma mostly mucinous and squamous cell carcinoma. They are generally discovered at an advanced stage with a poor prognosis because symptoms are generally the same as those of the fistula itself. Regular follow-up of chronic fistulas is then important for an early diagnosis as well as histological analysis of the fistula during surgery. There is no consensus on the ideal treatment but abdominoperineal resection is the corner stone with or without neo or adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy. This paper presents a rare case of mucinous adenocarcinoma in a chronic perianal fistula in a Crohn's disease female and provides a review of the literature.

Keywords: Child; Crohn's disease; Mechanism of action; Vitamin D
PMID: 37668037
Abstract: Vitamin D can not only regulate calcium and phosphorus metabolism, but also exert an immunoregulatory effect. Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Studies have shown that vitamin D is associated with CD and other autoimmune diseases and can improve the condition of patients with CD and promote their recovery by regulating intestinal immunity, repairing the intestinal mucosal barrier, inhibiting intestinal fibrosis, enhancing the response to infliximab, and regulating intestinal microbiota. Exogenous vitamin D supplementation can induce disease remission while increasing the serum level of vitamin D. However, only a few randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trials have investigated the therapeutic effect of vitamin D in CD, and the optimal form of vitamin D supplementation, the specific dosage of vitamin D supplementation, and the optimal serum maintenance concentration of vitamin D remain to be clarified. This article mainly discusses the mechanism of action of vitamin D in CD and the beneficial effect of exogenous vitamin D supplementation on CD.

Keywords: Epidemiology; Faroe Islands; Inflammatory bowel disease
PMID: 37667976
Abstract: The highest reported incidence rate of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and especially of ulcerative colitis (UC), is found in the Faroe Islands. This study aimed to assess the incidence rate and temporal trends in prevalence over six decades.Methods: All incident and prevalent patients diagnosed with IBD between 1960-2020 from the nationwide and population-based Faroese IBD cohort were included in this study. All patients fulfilled the Copenhagen Diagnostic Criteria.Overall, 873 individuals were diagnosed with IBD during the study period, 559 (64%) with UC, 151 (17%) with CD and 163 (19%) with IBDU. A total of 59 patients had paediatric-onset IBD. The incidence of IBD continued to increase throughout the study period, as the age-standardised incidence rate started at 8 per 100,000 person-years (py) (European Standard Population, ESP) in 1960-79 and reached 70 by 2010-20. In 2021, the age-standardised period prevalence was 1,414 per 100,000 persons. The IBD incidence was unevenly distributed among the islands with Sandoy having the highest rate of 106 per 100,000 py in 2010-2020.The incidence of IBD continues to increase in the Faroe Islands, mainly driven by UC. The incidence presents with an uneven geographical distribution, which suggests an adverse interaction between unknown environmental factors and genetic traits. The prevalence in 2021 corresponded to 1.3% of the Faroese population suffering from IBD. Environmental risk factors are suspected to impact this homogenous high-risk population; however, the reason is unclear.© The Author(s) 2023.

Abstract: Adherence to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) medication is crucial to maintain remission, especially during pregnancy.To examine the influence of family planning and pregnancy-related patient knowledge regarding IBD and pregnancy on adherence.Cross-sectional survey study.We surveyed female patients with IBD aged 18-35 years, who at recruitment to the UK IBD BioResource had not had children. We elicited disease and treatment history, demographics and family planning status via an online questionnaire. Patient knowledge as assessed by the validated Crohn's and Colitis Pregnancy Knowledge Score (CCPKnow) and adherence by visual analogue scale (VAS).In 326 responders (13.8% response rate), good adherence (VAS ⩾ 80) was found in only 38.35%. Disease- and treatment-related factors were not significantly associated with good adherence, except for methotrexate (70.0% adherent of 10 exposed patients versus 37.2% non-exposed; p = 0.036). Patients planning pregnancy for the next year were more often adherent (59.0% versus 35.5%; p = 0.019) and knowledgeable (median CCPKnow 8 versus 7; p = 0.035) compared to those in other family planning categories. Pregnancy-related patient knowledge was significantly associated with adherence (Pearson correlation 0.141; p = 0.015). Adherent patients had significantly higher CCPKnow scores than non-adherent patients (median 8 versus 6; p = 0.009). On binary regression analysis, only planning to conceive within 12 months was independently associated with better adherence (p = 0.016), but not methotrexate exposure (p = 0.076) and CCPKnow (p = 0.056).In a cohort of women of childbearing age with IBD overall medication, adherence was low. Planning to conceive within the next year was associated with better adherence and greater patient knowledge.© The Author(s), 2023.

Keywords: dynapenia; frailty; hospitalizations; inflammatory bowel disease; malnutrition
PMID: 37667803
Abstract: In patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), frailty is independently associated with mortality and morbidity.This study aimed to extend this work to determine the association between the clinical frailty scale (CFS), handgrip strength (HGS), and malnutrition with IBD-related hospitalizations and surgeries.IBD patients ⩾18 years of age were prospectively enrolled from two ambulatory care clinics in Alberta, Canada.Frailty was defined as a CFS score ⩾4, dynapenia as HGS < 16 kg for females and <27 kg for males, malnutrition using the subjective global assessment (SGA), and the risk of malnutrition using either the abridged patient-generated SGA (abPG-SGA), or the Saskatchewan Inflammatory Bowel Disease Nutrition Risk Tool (SaskIBD-NRT). Logarithm relative hazard graphs and multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for relevant confounders were constructed.One hundred sixty-one patients (35% ulcerative colitis, 65% Crohn's disease) with a mean age of 42.2 (±15.9) years were followed over a mean period of 43.9 (±10.1) months. Twenty-seven patients were hospitalized, and 13 patients underwent IBD-related surgeries following baseline. While the CFS (aHR 1.34; p = 0.61) and SGA (aHR 0.81; p = 0.69) did not independently predict IBD-related hospitalizations, decreased HGS (aHR 3.96; p = 0.03), increased abPG-SGA score (aHR 1.07; p = 0.03) and a SaskIBD-NRT ⩾ 5 (aHR 4.49; p = 0.02) did. No variable was independently associated with IBD-related surgeries.HGS, the abPG-SGA, and the SaskIBD-NRT were independently associated with an increased risk of IBD-related hospitalizations. Future studies should aim to validate other frailty assessments in the IBD population in order to better tailor care for all IBD patients.© The Author(s), 2023.

Keywords: Crohn's Disease; Fracture; Inflammatory Bowel Disease; Risk; Ulcerative Colitis
PMID: 37667580
Abstract: Fracture risks and associated factors are poorly understood in middle-aged and older Asian populations with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Therefore, we investigated fracture risk and the effects of comorbidities and lifestyle habits on the risk of developing fractures in middle-aged and older Korean patients with IBD.We conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study using data from the National Health Insurance Corporation Database. Patients with IBD who underwent the National Screening Program and were over 40 years of age were included in the study. We compared patients with age- and sex-matched controls. The incidence of fractures, including vertebral, hip, and other sites, was determined using claims data.The risk of total fractures and vertebral fractures was significantly higher in the IBD group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.31, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-1.48; adjusted HR, 1.59, 95% CI, 1.33-1.92, respectively). Obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and lack of exercise were associated with increased fracture risk in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). In contrast, the risk increases in patients with Crohn's disease regardless of comorbidities and lifestyle preferences.The risk of bone fracture, especially vertebral fracture, is high in middle-aged and older Korean patients with IBD. Obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and lack of exercise are all risk factors associated with bone fractures in patients with UC. These findings are helpful for clinicians to educate patients with IBD on bone health and raise awareness of bone fractures in patients with UC who have specific risk factors.© 2023 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.

PMID: 37667524
Abstract: Crohn's disease (CD), a form of inflammatory bowel disease, involves chronic inflammation within the gastrointestinal tract. Intestinal strictures and fistulas are common complications of CD with varying severity in their presentations. Modifications in oral diet or use of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) are common approaches to manage both stricturing and fistulizing disease, although supporting research evidence is generally limited. In the preoperative period, there is strong evidence that EEN can reduce surgical complications. Parenteral nutrition (PN) is often utilized in the management of enterocutaneous fistulas, given that oral diet and EEN may potentially increase output in proximal fistulas. This narrative review highlights the current practices and evidence for the roles of oral diet, EEN, and PN in treatment and management of stricturing and fistulizing CD.© 2023 The Authors.

PMID: 37667406
Abstract: Bariatric surgery candidates commonly suffer from conditions that constitute the metabolic syndrome. But they also have a higher risk for autoimmune and malignant diseases. Obesity-associated comorbidities aside from the metabolic syndrome are often given insufficient attention in the clinical routine, including preoperative work-ups for bariatric surgery.We retrospectively report the case of a 65 years old Caucasian patient who was diagnosed with Crohn's disease prior to, a hepatocellular carcinoma during, and a renal cell carcinoma post bariatric surgery. The relevance of these diseases for decision making in bariatric procedures and current recommendations for preoperative bariatric work-ups are discussed. In our case, the diagnosis of Crohn's disease led to the performance of a sleeve gastrectomy instead of a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and a previously unknown hepatocellular carcinoma was simultaneously removed by hepatic wedge resection.Preoperative endoscopy and imaging techniques can be valuable since surprising pre- and intraoperative findings can force the bariatric surgeon to change the initially planned operative strategy. But the diagnostic accuracy of abdominal ultrasound may be limited in bariatric surgery patients. With the expansion of bariatric surgery, the complexity of bariatric surgery patients is also likely to increase. However, with the appropriate awareness and strategies, bariatric surgery can be safely executed and even contribute to the treatment of severe comorbidities that exceed the metabolic spectrum.© 2023.

Keywords: 
PMID: 37666668
Abstract: PRMT5 is a type II arginine methyltransferase abundantly expressed in the colonic epithelium. It is up-regulated in inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer. However, its role in mucosal defense against enteric infection has not been studied. Here, we report that Prmt5 in the murine colon is up-regulated in response to Citrobacter rodentium infection. Pathogen clearance in mice with haploinsufficient expression of Prmt5 is significantly delayed compared with wildtype littermate controls. Transcriptomic analyses further reveal that PRMT5 regulates the expression of canonical crypt goblet cell genes involved in mucus production, assembly, and anti-microbial responses via methyltransferase activity-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Together, these findings uncover PRMT5 as a novel regulator of mucosal defense and a potential therapeutic target for treating intestinal diseases.© 2023 Hernandez et al.

PMID: 37666381
Abstract: Ocular complications are known to appear in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Among these, posterior segment complications can lead to substantial morbidity. The aim of the study is to evaluate the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL), and macula thickness measurement in patients with IBD.A total of 118 patients with IBD (42 Crohn's disease (CD), 76 ulcerative colitis (UC)) and 52 healthy subjects were included in the study. RNFL, GCIPL, and macula thickness were measured using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT).The central macular thickness was increased, mean and all superior quadrants of GCIPL thickness measurements were significantly decreased, but RNFL thickness wasn't changed in CD compared to healthy subjects. Although the central macular thickness increased, no change was observed in mean RNFL and GCIPL in UC compared to healthy subjects. Mean RNFL, GCIPL, and macular thickness did not differ during the remission and active phases of the disease in IBD. There was no difference in RNFL, GCIPL, and macular thicknesses in CD patients in terms of the location and behavior of the disease. A significant thickness increase was found in extensive type UC for inferior RNFL value compared to the left side and proctitis.IBD may cause an increase in macular thickness. This finding may be related to the inflammation or ischemia of the retina. The use of SD-OCT in ophthalmologic examination in patients with IBD may enable early detection of retinal changes and alert the clinician to complications of IBD.Copyright © 2023.

DEBUG:root:Input text: Title: Cumulative thiopurine dosing and keratinocyte skin cancer in inflammatory bowel disease: a case-control study.
Keywords: 
PMID: 37665613
Abstract: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treated with thiopurines are at increased risk of keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC). Most international guidelines recommend yearly dermatological screening of thiopurine-treated patients. Whether the association between the development of KSC and the use of thiopurines is dose-dependent remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the cumulative thiopurine dose and KSC development in patients with IBD which can be helpful to assist in further skin cancer risk stratification and personalization of screening recommendations in patients with IBD.We performed a single-center case-control study, including patients with IBD with and without a history of KSC (cases and controls, respectively). The primary outcome was the association of cumulative azathioprine, mercaptopurine and thioguanine dose with KSC development. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed, the latter corrected for age and smoking, known risk factors of KSC.We included 50 cases and 150 controls, predominantly white population. Age and current azathioprine use were univariably significantly associated with KSC development. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, age at inclusion remained significantly associated. Cumulative doses of thiopurines (separate or combined) or duration of thiopurine use did not impact KSC risk, also after correcting for age and smoking.Cumulative thiopurine dose and duration did not show an association with KSC development. Future KSC risk stratification, based on all available KSC risk factors, may aid in selecting individuals who can benefit most from dermatologic screening programs.Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

DEBUG:root:Input text: Title: Sodium Butyrate Protects Against Intestinal Oxidative Damage and Neuroinflammation in the Prefrontal Cortex of Ulcerative Colitis Mice Model.
Keywords: Antioxidant response; butyrate; inflammatory bowel diseases; neuroinflammation; oxidative damage
PMID: 37665564
Abstract: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) cause increased inflammatory signalling and oxidative damage. IBDs are correlated with an increased incidence of brain-related disorders suggesting that the gut-brain-axis exerts a pivotal role in IBD. Butyrate is one of the main microbial metabolites in the colon, and it can cross the blood-brain barrier, directly affecting the brain. We induced ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice utilizing dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in the drinking water for 7 days. Animals were divided into four groups, receiving water or DSS and treated with saline or 0,066 g/kg of Sodium Butyrate for 7 days. We also used an integrative approach, combining bioinformatics functional network and experimental strategies to understand how butyrate may affect UC. Butyrate was able to attenuate colitis severity and intestinal inflammation. Butyrate protected the colon against oxidative damage in UC and protected the prefrontal cortex from neuroinflammation observed in DSS group. Immunocontent of tight junction proteins Claudin-5 and Occludin were reduced in colon of DSS group mice and butyrate was able to restore to control levels. Occludin and Claudin-5 decrease in DSS group indicate that an intestinal barrier disruption may lead to the increased influx of gut-derived molecules, causing neuroinflammation in the prefrontal cortex, observed by increased IBA-1 marker. The probable protection mechanism of butyrate treatment occurs through NRF2 through Nrf2 and HIF-1α activation and consequent activation of catalase and superoxide dismutase. Our data suggest that systemic inflammation associated with intestinal barrier disruption in UC leads to neuroinflammation in the prefrontal cortex, which was atenuated by butyrate.

Keywords: 3D CT; Cinematic rendering; Crohn disease; Inflammatory bowel disease; Ulcerative colitis
PMID: 37665535
Abstract: Inflammatory conditions that affect long segments of bowel and/or the mesentery and mesenteric vasculature are a common cause of emergency department visits and evaluation by cross-sectional imaging. Inflammatory bowel disease, specifically Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, can be unsuspected at presentation and may only be eventually diagnosed based on initial imaging findings. Traditional 2D axial reconstructions and multi-planar reformations can be limited in their ability to globally assess the extent of disease. 3D methods such as volume rendering (VR) are often used as adjunctive means of visualizing the pathology in such patients. Recently, a novel technique known as cinematic rendering (CR) has emerged, utilizing advanced lighting models and ray tracing to simulate photon interactions with tissues, resulting in realistic shadows and enhanced surface detail compared to VR. Generating CR images from select presets takes an experienced radiologist approximately 5 min, meaning that the technique can be incorporated into meaningful emergency department workflows. Given the apparent advantages of CR, we highlight its application in a series of cases in which patients had inflammatory conditions that affected long segments of bowel and/or involved the mesentery, particularly those patients with inflammatory bowel disease, but also including patients with mesenteric venous thrombosis and lymphedema. Those conditions included inflammatory bowel disease, mesenteric venous thrombosis, and bowel lymphedema. We present examples of those conditions in this pictorial essay and describe the potential of CR to visualize key findings. As CR exhibits possible advantages, further studies are warranted to support its broader clinical adoption and assess its efficacy in diagnosing and guiding managing of inflammatory conditions in emergency settings.© 2023.

Keywords: 16S rRNA sequencing; DSS-induced colitis; gut microbiota; toll-like receptor 4
PMID: 37664927
Abstract: The cause of ulcerative colitis (UC) is not yet fully understood. Previous research has pointed towards a potential role for mutations in nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) in promoting the onset and progression of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by altering the microbiota of the gut. However, the relationship between toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and gut microbiota in IBD is not well understood. To shed light on this, the interaction between TLR4 and gut microbiota was studied using a mouse model of IBD.To examine the function of TLR4 signaling in intestinal injury repair, researchers developed Dextran Sulfate Sodium Salt (DSS)-induced colitis and injury models in both wild-type (WT) mice and TLR4 knockout (TLR4-KO) mice. To assess changes in the gut microbiota, 16S rRNA sequencing was conducted on fecal samples from both the TLR4-KO and WT enteritis mouse models.The data obtained depicted a protective function of TLR4 against DSS-induced colitis. The gut microbiota composition was found to vary considerably between the WT and TLR4-KO mice groups as indicated by β-diversity analysis and operational taxonomic units (OTUs) cluster. Statistical analysis of microbial multivariate variables depicted an elevated abundance of Escherichia coli/Shigella, Gammaproteobacteria, Tenerlcutes, Deferribacteres, Enterobacteria, Rikenellaceae, and Proteobacteria in the gut microbiota of TLR4-KO mice, whereas there was a considerable reduction in Bacteroidetes at five different levels of the phylogenetic hierarchy including phylum, class, order, family, and genus in comparison with the WT control.TLR4 may protect intestinal epithelial cells from damage in response to DSS-induced injury by controlling the microbiota in the gut.© 2023 The Author(s).

PMID: 37664383
Abstract: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are immune-mediated chronic inflammatory diseases that target the gastrointestinal tract and other distant organs. The incidence of IBDs has been rising and is more prevailing in Western communities. The etiology has been vague, but different theories include environmental factors that elicit an uncontrolled immune response, which damages internal organs. Treatment of either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis has witnessed significant advances; however, pharmacological drugs' side effects limit their use. Research about microbiota and its influence on IBDs has gained fame, and multiple studies correlate microbiota diversity positively with IBD treatment. Many factors contribute to the microbiota's health, including different diets, antibiotics, prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics. Specific immune responses lie behind the pathogenesis of IBDs and microbiota dysbiosis, and different studies have postulated new ways to control this abnormal response. Physical activity, sun exposure, efficient sleep, intermittent fasting, and supplementation of probiotics and vitamins are natural ways that help modulate this immune response, do not cost money as IBD pharmacological drugs, and do not come with deleterious side effects that are sometimes more harmful than IBDs. Our article proposes a comprehensive natural approach that can benefit IBD patients enormously. This approach does not replace the medications currently used in treating IBDs. The suggested approach can be used in combination with medications and might aid in reducing the doses of those medications.Copyright © 2023, Mahmoud et al.

Keywords: dietary interventions; disease management; ibd prevalence; inflammatory bowel disease (ibd); nutritional interventions
PMID: 37664362
Abstract: This comprehensive narrative review delves into the intricate interplay between diet and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), shedding light on the potential impact of dietary interventions in disease management. By analyzing nutritional interventions, risks, challenges, and future perspectives, this review serves as a vital resource for clinicians, researchers, and patients alike. The amalgamation of evidence underscores the significance of customizing dietary strategies for individual patients, considering disease phenotype and cultural factors. Through an exploration of dietary components' effects on IBD, including exclusive enteral nutrition and omega-3 fatty acids, this review offers pragmatic implementation advice and outlines avenues for further research. Bridging the gap between research findings and clinical applications, the review facilitates informed decision-making and patient-centric care. In the face of escalating IBD prevalence, this review emerges as an indispensable guide for healthcare professionals, empowering them to navigate the complexities of dietary management while enabling patients to actively participate in their care trajectory. Ultimately, this narrative review advances the understanding of diet's pivotal role in IBD management, fostering a more integrated approach to patient care and paving the way for improved research and policy initiatives in the field of inflammatory bowel diseases.Copyright © 2023, Saeed et al.

Keywords: paradoxical; pathogenesis; psoriasis; tnf-a inhibitor; treatment
PMID: 37664349
Abstract: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors have been shown to be well tolerated among patients with rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis. Meanwhile, more recently, clinical practice and research efforts have uncovered increasing cases of psoriatic lesion development tied to initiating treatment with a TNF-α inhibitor. The underlying mechanisms associated with this occurrence have yet to be fully elucidated. A review and analysis of cases of paradoxical psoriasis currently published in the literature is warranted. In addition, exploring possible mechanisms of action and potential treatment options associated with favorable outcomes is much needed. A systematic literature review was performed utilizing PubMed and Google Scholar databases (1992-present), in which 106 cases of paradoxical psoriasis were reviewed. The most common morphology developed was plaque psoriasis vulgaris. There was a female predominance (61.3%), and the most common underlying autoimmune disease was rheumatoid arthritis (45.3%). In addition, the most commonly associated drug with the onset of psoriatic lesions was infliximab (62.3%). Furthermore, the findings suggest that the most well-supported mechanism of action involves the uncontrolled release of interferon-alpha (IFN-α) from plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) after TNF-α inhibition. While TNF-α inhibitors have been shown to have great benefits to patients with rheumatologic diseases, cases of paradoxical psoriasis demonstrate the importance of close monitoring of patients on TNF-α inhibitors to allow for early recognition, treatment, and potentially change to a different mechanism of action of the medication used to prevent further progression of the inflammatory lesions.Copyright © 2023, Chokshi et al.

PMID: 37664295
Abstract: While macrocytic anemia is common in vitamin B12 deficiency, rarely, pancytopenia and hemolytic anemia can occur. Homocysteine levels are elevated in severe B12 deficiency, and this is linked to thrombus formation with potentially life-threatening complications. We present a patient with severe vitamin B12 deficiency complicated by hyperhomocysteinemia and obstructive shock from pulmonary embolism. A 56-year-old male with no medical history presented to the hospital with altered mentation. The patient's family stated he was experiencing bilateral paresthesias of his lower extremities, progressive depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Initial vitals were blood pressure of 76/36, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 14, and temperature of 36.3 degrees Celsius. He was intubated due to severe encephalopathy. Relevant labs indicated severe macrocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, decreased B12 levels, elevated methylmalonic acid, and elevated homocysteine. Imaging demonstrated a right common femoral vein thrombosis and subsegmental pulmonary emboli. Peripheral blood smear revealed schistocytes, anisopoikilocytosis, and decreased platelet count. The patient required fluid resuscitation, antibiotics, and multiple blood products. Vitamin B12 was administered intramuscularly, which improved the anemia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) demonstrated gastritis. Gastric and duodenal biopsies were negative for Helicobacter pylori and celiac disease. He was negative for intrinsic factor (IF) antibodies but had elevated gastrin levels. An intravenous unfractionated heparin infusion was started when the platelet count was above 50000. The patient was extubated after seven days. Heparin was transitioned to apixaban and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed. Hyperhomocysteinemia is a known pro-thrombotic factor that can lead to the development of venous thromboembolism. B12 malabsorption can stem from inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, gastritis, pancreatic insufficiency, gastrectomy, gastric bypass surgery, or antibodies to IF. While this case showed gastritis and negative IF antibodies, gastrin levels were elevated, indicating a mixed picture. This highlights the challenge of definitively diagnosing pernicious anemia as the cause of vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency may lead to critical illness in which thromboembolism develops secondary to hyperhomocysteinemia.Copyright © 2023, Khaliq et al.

Keywords: Crohn’s disease; Ulcerative colitis; biologics; intravenous; subcutaneous
PMID: 37664232
Abstract: A new subcutaneous (SC) formulation exists for infliximab (CT-P13 SC). The aim of this study was to assess the durability of clinical and endoscopic responses after a switch from intravenous (IV) to SC infliximab.Patients were transitioned on maintenance infliximab, including those with dose-optimized therapy. The primary outcome was clinical, biochemical and overall remission at 6 months, as defined by a Harvey-Bradshaw Index <5 for Crohn's disease or a partial Mayo score <3 for ulcerative colitis, C-reactive protein less than 10 mg/L, and fecal calprotectin less than 100 μg/g.Forty patients were switched from IV to SC infliximab. Twenty-seven (68%) had a diagnosis of Crohn's disease and 13 (33%) had ulcerative colitis. Twenty-three (58%) were on 5 mg/kg of IV infliximab every 8 weeks and 15 (38%) 5 mg/kg every 6 weeks. There were 2 patients (4%) on 10 mg/kg every 6 weeks. At the time of their switch, 37 (93%) patients were in clinical remission, 25 (76%) were in biochemical remission, and 25 (76%) were in both biochemical and clinical remission. At 6 months the proportion of patients in clinical remission decreased from 93% to 82%, with an overall relapse rate of 11%. Treatment persistence at 6 months was 77.5%.Switching patients from IV infliximab to 120 mg fortnightly SC injections is a safe and effective option for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, including for those patients on dose-escalated infliximab or with active disease at the time of switch.Copyright: © Hellenic Society of Gastroenterology.

DEBUG:root:Input text: Title: Barriers to and requirements for a successful transition in inflammatory bowel disease from pediatric to adult care in Greece.
Keywords: Transition; inflammatory bowel disease; pediatric
PMID: 37664230
Abstract: The incidence of pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is rising, while the relapsing and often severe nature of IBD, and its impact on emotional and pubertal development and social maturation underline the need for a successful transition from pediatric to adult care.A web-based survey was distributed via the Hellenic Group for the Study of IBD, the Hellenic Society of Gastroenterology Department of North Greece, and the Hellenic Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition.The questionnaire was answered by 98 individuals (78 adult and 20 pediatric gastroenterologists, out of 357 and 30, respectively). The response rate was 25.3%. A higher response rate was found among pediatric (66.6%) vs. adult gastroenterologists 21.8% (P<0.001). Pediatric gastroenterologists believed that the appropriate age for transition was either 16-17 or 17-18 years, whereas 59% of the adult gastroenterologists chose the age group of 16-17 years. Both adult and pediatric gastroenterologists stated that the most significant initiators for a successful transition process were cognitive maturity and patients' ability to manage their disease independently. The lack of communication and collaboration between pediatric and adult gastroenterologists was the main barrier to the transition process, as identified by adult gastroenterologists (27.7%). In contrast, 43.5% of pediatric gastroenterologists suggested that differences in the follow up of patients with IBD between pediatric and adult clinics were the main restrictions.These results highlight the need for a transitional education program for pediatric IBD patients, and the importance of improving collaboration among adult and pediatric gastroenterologists.Copyright: © Hellenic Society of Gastroenterology.

PMID: 37663975
Abstract: Erythema nodosum (EN) is a skin lesion that presents due to an inflammation of the subcutaneous fat, which is manifested clinically as a sudden onset of tender erythematous lesions. These lesions are typically localized to the pretibial surface. The cause of EN is mainly idiopathic, other causes are drugs, infections, autoimmune diseases, and inflammatory bowel disease. As vaccines are rarely known to cause EN, we are reporting a case of a 19-year-old female with a delayed recurrent reaction following the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.Copyright © 2023, Alghamdi et al.

Keywords: Colitis-associated colorectal cancer; Colonoscopic surveillance; Epidemiology; Inflammatory bowel disease; Management; Mechanisms
PMID: 37663937
Abstract: Colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) is defined as a specific cluster of colorectal cancers that develop as a result of prolonged colitis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Patients with IBD, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are known to have an increased risk of developing CAC. Although the incidence of CAC has significantly decreased over the past few decades, individuals with CAC have increased mortality compared to individuals with sporadic colorectal cancer, and the incidence of CAC increases with duration. Chronic inflammation is generally recognized as a major contributor to the pathogenesis of CAC. CAC has been shown to progress from colitis to dysplasia and finally to carcinoma. Accumulating evidence suggests that multiple immune-mediated pathways, DNA damage pathways, and pathogens are involved in the pathogenesis of CAC. Over the past decade, there has been an increasing effort to develop clinical approaches that could help improve outcomes for CAC patients. Colonoscopic surveillance plays an important role in reducing the risk of advanced and interval cancers. It is generally recommended that CAC patients undergo endoscopic removal or colectomy. This review summarizes the current understanding of CAC, particularly its epidemiology, mechanisms, and management. It focuses on the mechanisms that contribute to the development of CAC, covering advances in genomics, immunology, and the microbiome; presents evidence for management strategies, including endoscopy and colectomy; and discusses new strategies to interfere with the process and development of CAC. These scientific findings will pave the way for the management of CAC in the near future.©The Author(s) 2023. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved.

PMID: 37663925
Abstract: This retrospective study gathered medical/pharmacy claims data on patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) between January 01, 2000 and March 31, 2019 from the IBM MarketScan commercial claims database to assess the real-world impact of fatigue on healthcare costs in patients newly diagnosed with IBD.Eligible participants were ≥18 years, newly diagnosed with IBD (≥2 separate claims), and had ≥12 months of continuous database enrollment before and after fatigue diagnosis. The date of fatigue diagnosis was the index date; participants were followed for 12 months post-index. Patients with (cases) or without (controls) fatigue were matched 1:1 by propensity score matching. Patients with evidence of prior IBD diagnosis/treatment, or those with a chronic disease other than IBD wherein fatigue is the primary symptom, were excluded. Healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), including hospitalizations, inpatient and outpatient visits, and associated costs were compared between cases and controls.Matched IBD cohorts (21 321 cases/21 321 controls) were identified (42% Crohn's disease [CD] and 58% ulcerative colitis [UC]) with similar baseline characteristics (average age: 46 years; 60% female). Cases versus controls had significantly more all-cause outpatient visits (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 95% confidence intervals [95% CI]: 1.64 [1.61, 1.67], P < .001) and all-cause hospitalizations (IRR [95% CI]: 1.92 [1.81, 2.04], P < .001); as well as significantly higher all-cause total direct healthcare costs (mean: $24 620 vs. $15 324; P < .001). Similar findings were observed for IBD-related outcomes, as well as in CD- and UC-specific subgroups.Presence of fatigue is associated with an increase in HCRU and total medical costs among patients newly diagnosed with IBD.© The Author(s) 2023.

Keywords: IPAA; J-pouch; pouchitis; pyoderma gangrenosum
PMID: 37663924
Abstract: Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare, neutrophilic dermatosis that is a well-established extraintestinal manifestation (EIM) of inflammatory bowel disease. The clinical implications of developing PG in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) who undergo total proctocolectomy colectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis (TPC-IPAA) surgery remain unknown.Study participants were selected from patients enrolled in the Carlino Family Inflammatory Bowel and Colorectal Disease Biobank between 1998 and 2021 with a pre-colectomy diagnosis of UC and who underwent TPC-IPAA surgery. A retrospective study comparing patients with PG and those without PG was performed. The outcomes measured included the development of pouchitis, pouchitis classification, presence of pouch fistula, anal fistula, anal stenosis, and pouch failure.In this study, 357 IPAA patients were included, 10 of whom suffered PG. Patients with PG and without PG had similar demographics and clinical characteristics. Both groups had similar rates of pouchitis (80% in PG patients and 64% in patients without PG, P = .504). However, IPAA patients with PG had a higher risk of developing pouch fistula (50% vs 10%, P = .002), anal fistula (40% vs 12%, P = .031), and Crohn's-like disease of the pouch (70% vs 15%, P = .003) compared to patients without PG. Patients who developed PG prior to their first episode of pouchitis were more likely to eventually experience pouch failure (odds ratio: 20.7, 95% confidence interval: 3.9, 110.7, q = 0.003 after false discovery rate adjustment).Among UC patients who undergo TPC-IPAA surgery, the development of PG portends poor pouch outcomes and is predictive of pouch failure.© The Author(s) 2023.

Patients who developed PG prior to their first episode of pouchitis were more likely to eventually experience pouch failure (odds ratio: 20.7, 95% confidence interval: 3.9, 110.7, q = 0.003 after false discovery rate adjustment).Among UC patients who undergo TPC-IPAA surgery, the development of PG portends poor pouch outcomes and is predictive of pouch failure.\\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.

Keywords: case report; inflammatory bowel disease; laparoscopy; omental torsion; sclerosing cholangitis
PMID: 37663741
Abstract: The omentum appears as an apron-like extension of the peritoneum.A 30-year-old male patient, presented to the emergency department with the chief complaints of acute nonradiating pain localized in the right-side abdomen for the past 3 days. The patient had a past medical history of sclerosing cholangitis (SC) with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The patient reported the pain as persistent, pressure-like, and moderate. The patient also had a low-grade fever and nausea at the time of admission. On examination, the vital signs were found as normal. The patient reported that the abdominal pain gets exacerbated after the meals, and increase in physical activity and movement. Due to the patient's complaints and history of SC and IBD, these were considered as the possible diagnosis. After the diagnostic procedures, the patient was finally diagnosed with OT.This report presents a case of a patient suffering from omental torsion having history of SC and IBD. During the laparoscopic procedure, the diagnosis of omental torsion was confirmed. To our knowledge, no case report of omental torsion with IBD and SC is published in the literature.This seems to be a major diagnostic challenge as patients with IBD almost resembles the same clinical signs and symptoms as in the omental torsion. The possibility of misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis could result in the unfavorable outcome. Therefore, the healthcare fraternities are advised to include the rare diseases such as OT as the differential diagnosis.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

DEBUG:root:Input text: Title: Erythema nodosum after golimumab treatment in ankylosing spondylitis patients: a case report and literature review.
Keywords: ankylosing spondylitis; anti-TNF-; erythema nodosum; golimumab; inhibitors
PMID: 37663707
Abstract: Erythema nodosum (EN) is a self-limited septal panniculitis that presents with fever, arthralgia, and arthritis. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitor such as golimumab has been found to treat EN in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). We herein report the paradoxical occurrence of EN following golimumab for ankylosing spondylitis.A 34-year-old female presented in June 2022 with a complaint of 'sores' on her feet that intermittently presented for approximately 5 months but that had worsened dramatically in the last 24 h. The patient had an 8-year history of ankylosing spondylitis for 7 years. Subcutaneous golimumab was administered every 4 weeks as she had not responded to other treatments. Twenty-four hours after the fifth subcutaneous injection, painful, erythematous nodules appeared, histologically compatible with EN. Despite this side effect, we continue therapy due to the good response and efficacy.Skin reactions were associated with the treatment with golimumab, including warm tender skin around the injection site, eruptions, itchiness, and sometimes a full-body rash. Golimumab was successfully used in treating EN in Crohn's disease. Because our patient continued on golimumab, the temporal association of EN flares with therapeutic injection and the lack of any etiology support a direct causal relationship between EN and golimumab treatment.TNF-α inhibitors are useful in treating Crohn's disease patients with EN, although it may present as an adverse effect of this treatment. Further work is needed.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

DEBUG:root:Input text: Title: Therapeutic potential of gene therapy for gastrointestinal diseases: Advancements and future perspectives.
Keywords: clinical trials; delivery carriers; gastrointestinal disease; gene therapy; gene therapy targets
PMID: 37663132
Abstract: Advancements in understanding the pathogenesis mechanisms underlying gastrointestinal diseases, encompassing inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal cancer, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, have led to the identification of numerous novel therapeutic targets. These discoveries have opened up exciting possibilities for developing gene therapy strategies to treat gastrointestinal diseases. These strategies include gene replacement, gene enhancement, gene overexpression, gene function blocking, and transgenic somatic cell transplantation. In this review, we introduce the important gene therapy targets and targeted delivery systems within the field of gastroenterology. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent progress in gene therapy related to gastrointestinal disorders and shed light on the application of innovative gene-editing technologies in treating these conditions. These developments are fueling a revolution in the management of gastrointestinal diseases. Ultimately, we discuss the current challenges (particularly regarding safety, oral efficacy, and cost) and explore potential future directions for implementing gene therapy in the clinical settings for gastrointestinal diseases.© 2023 The Authors.

Keywords: Cytotoxin-associated antigen A oncoprotein; Gut microbiota; Helicobacter pylori; Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein; Immunological modulation; Inflammatory bowel disease; NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome
PMID: 37662864
Abstract: Many studies point to an association between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Although controversial, this association indicates that the presence of the bacterium somehow affects the course of IBD. It appears that H. pylori infection influences IBD through changes in the diversity of the gut microbiota, and hence in local chemical characteristics, and alteration in the pattern of gut immune response. The gut immune response appears to be modulated by H. pylori infection towards a less aggressive inflammatory response and the establishment of a targeted response to tissue repair. Therefore, a T helper 2 (Th2)/macrophage M2 response is stimulated, while the Th1/macrophage M1 response is suppressed. The immunomodulation appears to be associated with intrinsic factors of the bacteria, such as virulence factors - such oncogenic protein cytotoxin-associated antigen A, proteins such H. pylori neutrophil-activating protein, but also with microenvironmental changes that favor permanence of H. pylori in the stomach. These changes include the increase of gastric mucosal pH by urease activity, and suppression of the stomach immune response promoted by evasion mechanisms of the bacterium. Furthermore, there is a causal relationship between H. pylori infection and components of the innate immunity such as the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome that directs IBD toward a better prognosis.©The Author(s) 2023.

Keywords: Akkermansia; Aquaporin 4; Colitis; Fecal microbiota transplantation; Lactobacillus; Toll-like receptor 4; Transcriptome sequencing
PMID: 37662857
Abstract: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has shown promising therapeutic effects on mice with experimental colitis and patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). FMT modulates the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway to treat some other diseases. However, it remains unknown whether this modulation is also involved in the treatment of UC.To clarify the necessity of TLR4 signaling pathway in FMT on dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced mice and explain the mechanism of FMT on UC, through association analysis of gut microbiota with colon transcriptome in mice.A mouse colitis model was constructed with wild-type (WT) and TLR4-knockout (KO) mice. Fecal microbiota was transplanted by gavage. Colon inflammation severity was measured by disease activity index (DAI) scoring and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Gut microbiota structure was analyzed through 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. Gene expression in the mouse colon was obtained by transcriptome sequencing.The KO (DSS + Water) and KO (DSS + FMT) groups displayed indistinguishable body weight loss, colon length, DAI score, and histology score, which showed that FMT could not inhibit the disease in KO mice. In mice treated with FMT, the relative abundance of Akkermansia decreased, and Lactobacillus became dominant. In particular, compared with those in WT mice, the scores of DAI and colon histology were clearly decreased in the KO-DSS group. Microbiota structure showed a significant difference between KO and WT mice. Akkermansia were the dominant genus in healthy KO mice. The ineffectiveness of FMT in KO mice was related to the decreased abundance of Akkermansia. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis showed that differentially expressed genes between each group were mainly involved in cytoplasmic translation and cellular response to DNA damage stimulus. The top nine genes correlating with Akkermansia included Aqp4, Clca4a, Dpm3, Fau, Mcrip1, Meis3, Nupr1 L, Pank3, and Rps13 (|R| > 0.9, P < 0.01).FMT may ameliorate DSS-induced colitis by regulating the TLR4 signaling pathway. TLR4 modulates the composition of gut microbiota and the expression of related genes to ameliorate colitis and maintain the stability of the intestinal environment. Akkermansia bear great therapeutic potential for colitis.©The Author(s) 2023. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved.

DEBUG:root:Input text: Title: The role of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) exposure in inflammation of intestinal tissues and intestinal carcinogenesis.
Keywords: colorectal cancer; gastrointestinal tract; per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS); perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS); ulcerative colitis
PMID: 37662676
Abstract: PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are organofluorine substances that are used commercially in products like non-stick cookware, food packaging, personal care products, fire-fighting foam, etc. These chemicals have several different subtypes made of varying numbers of carbon and fluorine atoms. PFAS substances that have longer carbon chains, such as PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonic acid), can potentially pose a significant public health risk due to their ability to bioaccumulate and persist for long periods of time in the body and the environment. The National Academies Report suggests there is some evidence of PFOS exposure and gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation contributing to ulcerative colitis. Inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis are precursors to colorectal cancer. However, evidence about the association between PFOS and colorectal cancer is limited and has shown contradictory findings. This review provides an overview of population and preclinical studies on PFOS exposure and GI inflammation, metabolism, immune responses, and carcinogenesis. It also highlights some mitigation approaches to reduce the harmful effects of PFOS on GI tract and discusses the dietary strategies, such as an increase in soluble fiber intake, to reduce PFOS-induced alterations in cellular lipid metabolism. More importantly, this review demonstrates the urgent need to better understand the relationship between PFOS and GI pathology and carcinogenesis, which will enable development of better approaches for interventions in populations exposed to high levels of PFAS, and in particular to PFOS.Copyright © 2023 Durham, Tessmann, Deng, Hennig and Zaytseva.

Keywords: Cohort; Colorectal cancer; Inflammatory bowel disease; Statin
PMID: 37662517
Abstract: Statin use has been linked to a reduced risk of advanced colorectal adenomas, but its association with colorectal cancer (CRC) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) - a high risk population for CRC - remains inconclusive.From a nationwide IBD cohort in Sweden, we identified 5273 statin users and 5273 non-statin users (1:1 propensity score matching) from July 2006 to December 2018. Statin use was defined as the first filled prescription for ≥30 cumulative defined daily doses and followed until December 2019. Primary outcome was incident CRC. Secondary outcomes were CRC-related mortality and all-cause mortality. Cox regression estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).During a median follow-up of 5.6 years, 70 statin users (incidence rate (IR): 21.2 per 10,000 person-years) versus 90 non-statin users (IR: 29.2) were diagnosed with incident CRC (rate difference (RD), -8.0 (95% CIs: -15.8 to -0.2 per 10,000 person-years); aHR = 0.76 (95% CIs: 0.61 to 0.96)). The benefit for incident CRC was duration-dependent in a nested case-control design: as compared to short-term use (30 days to <1 year), the adjusted odd ratios were 0.59 (0.25 to 1.43) for 1 to <2 years of use, 0.46 (0.21 to 0.98) for 2 to <5 years of use, and 0.38 (0.16 to 0.86) for ≥5 years of use (Pfor tread = 0.016). Compared with non-statin users, statin users also had a decreased risk for CRC-related mortality (IR: 6.0 vs. 11.9; RD, -5.9 (-10.5 to -1.2); aHR, 0.56 (0.37 to 0.83)) and all-cause mortality (IR: 156.4 vs. 231.4; RD, -75.0 (-96.6 to -53.4); aHR, 0.63 (0.57 to 0.69)).Statin use was associated with a lower risk of incident CRC, CRC-related mortality, and all-cause mortality. The benefit for incident CRC was duration-dependent, with a significantly lower risk after ≥2 years of statin use.This research was supported by Forte (i.e., the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare).© 2023 The Author(s).

Abstract: Gut microbiota plays a crucial role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and has therapeutic benefits. Thus, targeting the gut microbiota is a promising therapeutic approach for IBD treatment. We recently found that red cabbage juice (RCJ) ameliorates dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. The current study investigated the modulation of gut microbiota in response to treatment with RCJ to ameliorate the DSS colitis. The initial results demonstrated that mice treated with DSS + RCJ showed increased body weight and decreased diarrhea and blood in feces compared to the DSS alone group. RCJ ameliorated colitis by regulating the intestinal barrier function by reducing the number of apoptotic cells, improving colonic protective mucin, and increasing tight junction protein in RCJ + DSS groups compared to the DSS group. Short-gun metagenomic analysis revealed significant enrichment of short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs)-producing bacteria (Butyrivibrio, Ruminococcaceae, Acetatifactor muris, Rosburia Sp. CAG:303 , Dorea Sp. 5-2) increased PPAR-© activation, leading to repression of the nuclear factor κB (NFκB) signaling pathway, thus decreasing the production of crucial inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the RCJ + DSS groups compared to the DSS group. Pathway abundance analysis showed an increased abundance of the SCFA pathway, reduced histidine degradation ( Bacteroides sartorii, and Bacteroides caecimuris ), and LCFA production in the RCJ+DSS treated group, suggesting the promotion of good colonic health. Furthermore, increased T-reg (FOXP3+) cells in the colon were due to SCFAs produced by the gut microbiota, which was corroborated by an increase in IL-10, a vital anti-inflammatory cytokine. Thus, our study provides the first evidence that RCJ ameliorates colonic inflammation by modulating the gut microbiota.

Abstract: Digestive system diseases have evolved into a growing global burden without sufficient therapeutic measures. Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) is considered as a new potential economical therapy for its probiotic effects in the gastrointestinal system. We have provided an overview of the researches supporting various L. reuteri strains' application in treating common digestive system diseases, including infantile colic, diarrhea, constipation, functional abdominal pain, Helicobacter pylori infection, inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, colorectal cancer and liver diseases.The summarized literature in this review was derived from databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar.The therapeutic effects of L. reuteri in digestive system diseases may depend on various direct and indirect mechanisms, including metabolite production as well as modulation of the intestinal microbiome, preservation of the gut barrier function, and regulation of the host immune system. These actions are largely strain-specific and depend on the activation or inhibition of various certain signal pathways. It is well evidenced that L. reuteri can be effective both as a prophylactic measure and as a preferred therapy for infantile colic, and it can also be recommended as an adjuvant strategy to diarrhea, constipation, Helicobacter pylori infection in therapeutic settings. While preclinical studies have shown the probiotic potential of L. reuteri in the management of functional abdominal pain, inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, colorectal cancer and liver diseases, its application in these disease settings still needs further study.This review focuses on the probiotic effects of L. reuteri on gut homeostasis via certain signaling pathways, and emphasizes the importance of these probiotics as a prospective treatment against several digestive system diseases.Copyright © 2023 Peng, Ma, Luo, Jiang, Xu and Yu.

Keywords: 
PMID: 37661602
Abstract: BACKGROUND Fistulas involving the stomach and duodenum in Crohn's disease are rare (occurring in less than 1% of patients). Here, we reviewed registers from 855 patients with Crohn's disease treated in our service from January 2007 to December 2020 and found 4 cases of duodenal fistula and 1 case of gastric fistula. CASE REPORT The fistula origin was in the ileocolic segment in all cases, and all of the patients underwent preoperative optimization with improvement of nutritional status and infection control. They then underwent surgical treatment with resection of the affected segment and duodenal or gastric closure with covering by an omental patch. One case of a duodenal fistula was complicated by duodenal dehiscence. This was treated surgically with duodenojejunostomy. Each of the other patients had an uneventful postoperative course. All patients were successfully cured of their gastroduodenal fistulas, and at the time of this publication, none of them died or had fistula recurrence. CONCLUSIONS Fistulas with the involvement of the stomach and duodenum in patients with Crohn's disease are almost always due to inflammation in the ileum, colon, or previous ileocolic anastomosis. Management of this situation is complex and often requires clinical and surgical assistance; preoperative optimization of the patient's general condition can improve the surgical results. The surgical approach is based on resection of the affected segment and gastric or duodenal closure with covering by an omental patch. Gastrojejunostomy or duodenojejunostomy can be performed in selected patients with larger defects and minor jejunal disease. To prevent recurrence, prophylactic therapy with anti-TNF agents and early endoscopic surveillance are also essential for successful treatment.

Keywords: Apoptosis; Barrier tissues; CD14; Homeostasis; Lipopolysaccharide; TLR4
PMID: 37661484
Abstract: CD14 is a co-receptor of Toll-like receptor (TLR)- 4, with a critical role in innate immune responses. CD14 recognizes bacterial lipopolysaccharides, pathogen-, and damage-associated molecular patterns, thereby facilitating inflammatory immune responses. In addition to its well-established association with TLR4, CD14 is also implicated in TLR4-independent signaling, which leads to the apoptotic death of differentiated dendritic cells and activation of the noncanonical inflammasome pathway. CD14 also has a role beyond that of the immune responses. It contributes to tissue homeostasis by promoting the clearance of various apoptotic cells via recognizing externalized phosphatidylinositol phosphates. CD14 also has context-dependent roles, particularly in barrier tissues that include the skin and gastrointestinal tract. For example, CD14+ dendritic cells in the skin can induce immunostimulatory or immunosuppressive responses. In the gastrointestinal system, CD14 is involved in producing inflammatory cytokines in inflammatory bowel disease and maintaining of intestinal integrity. This review focuses on the multifaceted roles of CD14 in innate immunity and its potential regulatory functions in barrier tissues characterized by rapid cell renewal. By providing insights into the diverse functions of CD14, this review offers potential therapeutic implications for this versatile molecule in immune modulation and tissue homeostasis.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Keywords: Co-occurrence network; Crohn’s disease; Mucosal and fecal microbiota; Occurrence frequency
PMID: 37661264
Abstract: Bacteria abundance alternation in the feces or mucosa of Crohn's disease (CD) patients has long been applied to identify potential biomarkers for this disease, while the taxa occurrence frequency and their correlations with clinical traits were understudied. A total of 97 samples from the feces and gut mucosa were collected from CD patients and healthy controls (HCs), 16S rRNA-based analyses were performed to determine the changes in taxa abundance and occurrence frequency along CD and to correlate them with clinical traits. The results showed that bacteria communities were divergent between feces and mucosa, while the taxa abundance and occurrence frequency in both partitions showed similar exponential correlations. The decrease of specific fecal bacteria was much more effective in classifying the CD and HCs than that of the mucosal bacteria. Among them, Christensenellaceae_R-7_group and Ruminococcus were predicted as biomarkers by using random forest algorithm, which were persistently presented (> 71.40% in frequency) in the feces of the HCs with high abundance, whereas transiently presented in the feces (< 5.5% in frequency) and mucosa (< 18.18% in frequency) of CD patients with low abundance. Co-occurrence network analysis then identified them as hub taxa that drive the alternations of other bacteria and were positively correlated to the circuiting monocytes. The loss of specific bacteria in the healthy gut may cause great disturbance of gut microbiota, causing gut bacteria dysbiosis and correlated to immune disorders along CD, which might not only be developed as effective noninvasive biomarkers but also as therapy targets.© 2023.

PMID: 37661203
Abstract: To explore the efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) as a treatment approach for ulcerative colitis (UC), a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was conducted. To collect and evaluate randomized controlled trials of high quality on FMT for UC, we searched a number of databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, Embase, and Medline, for studies published between the establishment of the databases and March 2023. We conducted a meta-analysis of the studies using Review Manager software (version 5.4.1) to determine the differences in rates of remission and adverse reactions between the FMT group and the control group, utilizing the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to combine our findings. A total of 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy of FMT in patients with UC were included in the study, in which 580 patients participated, including 293 patients treated with FMT and 287 control subjects. Meta-analysis revealed that clinical remission was significantly better in the FMT group than in the control group [RR = 1.73; 95% CI = (1.41, 2.12); P < 0.00001]; endoscopic remission was significantly better in the FMT group than in the control group [RR = 1.74; 95% CI = (1.24, 2.44); P = 0.001]. Additionally, there were no significant differences in the incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups [RR = 1.00; 95% CI = (0.86, 1.15); P = 0.96]. Fecal microbiota transplantation has shown potential as a therapeutic intervention for inducing clinical remission in ulcerative colitis UC; nevertheless, the attainment of endoscopic remission and the maintenance of long-term remission continue to present challenges. Safety concerns persist throughout the treatment process, necessitating the implementation of measures to augment both safety and success rates.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited.

Abstract: External beam radiotherapy is a safe and effective curative treatment modality for men with localized prostate cancer (PCa). While traditionally entailing long courses with low daily doses, an appreciation of prostate radiobiology and advancements in radiation delivery have allowed for more abbreviated courses of EBRT. Ultrahypofractionated radiotherapy, which involves the delivery of >5 Gy/fraction, is now considered a standard of care regimen for localized PCa, especially intermediate-risk disease. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), a specific form of ultrahypofractionated radiotherapy that utilizes advanced planning, imaging, and treatment technology to deliver in ≤5 fractions, is in particular emerging as a cost-effective, convenient, and safe alternative to longer courses of radiotherapy. Given SBRT's recent adoption into the standard-of-care armamentarium of PCa treatment and its increasing utilization in this setting, it is important to highlight practical considerations pertaining to patient selection, fractionation scheme, target delineation and planning objectives, particularly when practitioners are faced with difficult clinical situations without clear evidence to provide guidance. The objective of this case-based guide endorsed by the Radiosurgery Society is to provide a practical framework for delivering SBRT to the intact prostate, especially in areas of controversy, illustrated by two challenging cases. In this article, we will discuss common SBRT dose/fractionation schemes and dose constraints for organs-at-risk. We will also review existing evidence and expert opinions on topics such as SBRT dose escalation, utility of rectal spacers, the role of androgen deprivation therapy in the setting of SBRT, SBRT in special patient populations such as those with high-risk disease, large prostate, high baseline urinary symptom burdens and inflammatory bowel disease, as well as new imaging-guidance techniques (e.g. Magnetic Resonance Imaging) for SBRT delivery.Copyright © 2023.

While traditionally entailing long courses with low daily doses, an appreciation of prostate radiobiology and advancements in radiation delivery have allowed for more abbreviated courses of EBRT. Ultrahypofractionated radiotherapy, which involves the delivery of >5 Gy/fraction, is now considered a standard of care regimen for localized PCa, especially intermediate-risk disease. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), a specific form of ultrahypofractionated radiotherapy that utilizes advanced planning, imaging, and treatment technology to deliver in \\u22645 fractions, is in particular emerging as a cost-effective, convenient, and safe alternative to longer courses of radiotherapy. Given SBRT\'s recent adoption into the standard-of-care armamentarium of PCa treatment and its increasing utilization in this setting, it is important to highlight practical considerations pertaining to patient selection, fractionation scheme, target delineation and planning objectives, particularly when practitioners are faced with difficult clinical situations without clear evidence to provide guidance. The objective of this case-based guide endorsed by the Radiosurgery Society is to provide a practical framework for delivering SBRT to the intact prostate, especially in areas of controversy, illustrated by two challenging cases. In this article, we will discuss common SBRT dose/fractionation schemes and dose constraints for organs-at-risk. We will also review existing evidence and expert opinions on topics such as SBRT dose escalation, utility of rectal spacers, the role of androgen deprivation therapy in the setting of SBRT, SBRT in special patient populations such as those with high-risk disease, large prostate, high baseline urinary symptom burdens and inflammatory bowel disease, as well as new imaging-guidance techniques (e.g. Magnetic Resonance Imaging) for SBRT delivery.Copyright \\u00a9 2023.

PMID: 37660948
Abstract: MUC13 cell surface mucin is highly expressed on the mucosal surface throughout the intestine, yet its role against bacterial infection is unknown. We investigated how MUC13 impacts Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Tm) infection and elucidated its mechanisms of action.Muc13-/- and wild-type littermate mice were gavaged with 2 isogenic strains of S. Tm after pre-conditioning with streptomycin. We assessed clinical parameters, cecal histology, local and systemic bacterial load, and proinflammatory cytokines after infection. Cecal enteroids and epithelial cell lines were used to evaluate the mechanism of MUC13 activity following infection. The interaction between bacterial SiiE and MUC13 was assessed using siiE-deficient Salmonella.S. Tm-infected Muc13-/- mice had increased disease activity, histological damage, and higher local and systemic bacterial loads. Mechanistically, we found that S. Tm binds to MUC13 through its giant-SiiE-adhesin and that MUC13 acts as a pathogen-binding decoy shed from the epithelial cell surface following pathogen engagement, limiting bacterial invasion. Additionally, MUC13 reduces epithelial cell death and intestinal barrier breakdown by enhancing NF-ĸB signaling during infection, independent of its decoy function.We show for the first time that MUC13 plays a critical role in antimicrobial defense against pathogenic S. Tm at the intestinal mucosal surface by both acting as a releasable decoy limiting bacterial invasion and reducing pathogen-induced cell death. This further implicates the cell surface mucin family in mucosal defense from bacterial infection.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DEBUG:root:Input text: Title: Crohn's Disease Features in Anastomotic Biopsies from Patients With and Without Crohn's Disease: Diagnostic and Prognostic Value.
Keywords: 
PMID: 37660927
Abstract: Endoscopic evidence of disease activity is a critical predictor of clinical relapse in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and histologic disease activity is evolving as a similarly important endpoint for patient management. However, classical morphologic features of CD may overlap with postoperative inflammatory changes, confounding the evaluation of anastomotic biopsies. There is a clear unmet need for better characterization of diagnostic and clinically significant histological features of CD in these surgically altered sites. We evaluated ileocolonic and colocolonic/rectal anastomotic biopsies performed at three academic institutions in patients with and without CD. The biopsies were blindly assessed for CD histologic features and correlated to clinical and endoscopic characteristics. In CD patients, the presence of each feature was correlated with the subsequent clinical exacerbation or relapse. We obtained anastomotic biopsies from 208 patients of which 109 were operated on for CD and 99 for another indication (neoplasia (80%), diverticular disease (11%), other (9%)). Mean time since surgery was 10 years (0-59; 14 years for CD (1-59), 6 years for non-CD (0-33)). Endoscopic inflammation was noted in 52% of cases (68% for CD, 35% for non-CD). Microscopic inflammation was present in 74% of cases (82% for CD, 67% for non-CD). Only discontinuous lymphoplasmacytosis (p<0.001) and pyloric gland metaplasia (p=0.04) occurred significantly more often in CD patients. However, none of the histologic features predicted clinical disease progression. In subset analysis, the presence of histologic features of CD in non-anastomotic biopsies obtained concurrently in CD patients was significantly associated with relapse (p=0.03). Due to extensive morphologic overlap between CD and postoperative changes and the lack of specific histologic features of relapse, biopsies from anastomotic sites are of no value in predicting clinical CD progression. Instead, CD activity in biopsies obtained away from anastomotic sites should be used for guiding endoscopic sampling and clinical management.Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc.

DEBUG:root:Input text: Title: PER2/P65-driven glycogen synthase 1 transcription in macrophages modulates gut inflammation and pathogenesis of rectal prolapse.
Keywords: Per2; inflammatory; inflammatory bowel disease; macrophage; rectal prolapse
PMID: 37660913
Abstract: Rectal prolapse in serious inflammatory bowel disease is caused by abnormal reactions of the intestinal mucosal immune system. The circadian clock has been implicated in immune defense and inflammatory responses, but the mechanisms by which it regulates gut inflammation remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the role of the rhythmic gene Period2 (Per2) in triggering inflammation in the rectum and its contribution to the pathogenesis of rectal prolapse. We report that Per2 deficiency in mice increased susceptibility to intestinal inflammation and resulted in spontaneous rectal prolapse. We further demonstrated that PER2 was essential for the transcription of glycogen synthase 1 (Gys1) by interacting with the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65. We show inhibition of Per2 reduced the levels of GYS1 and glycogen synthesis in macrophages, impairing the capacity of pathogen clearance and disrupting the composition of gut microbes. Taken together, our findings identify a novel role for Per2 in regulating the capacity of pathogen clearance in macrophages and gut inflammation, and suggest a potential animal model that more closely resembles human rectal prolapse.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Keywords: Crohn’s disease; Incidence; Inflammatory bowel disease; Ulcerative colitis
PMID: 37660767
Abstract: Limited studies have evaluated the burden of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in China. We aimed to estimate the incidence of IBD including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) in urban China.The national urban incidence in 2016 was calculated based on urban basic medical insurance from 2012 to 2016 in China by using a 4-year washout period. The incidence in Yinzhou District estimated from the Yinzhou electronic healthcare record database was used to test the accuracy of the results from insurance data.A total of 95,555 IBD patients were identified. The incidence in 2016 was 10.04 [95% confidence interval (CI): 6.95 to 13.71] per 100,000 person-years. The incidence rates of both UC and CD were higher among males than among females. There was a sharp increase in UC incidence before the age of 30 years and stabilization in later years (50-79 years old), while CD incidence peaked at 30-34 years old and experienced decline subsequently. The incidence of UC was much greater than that of CD, with a UC-to-CD incidence ratio of 12.61. The results from the Yinzhou database confirmed these results.This study is the first to draw a portrait of the distribution of IBD in urban China. The difference in IBD incidence between urban China and other countries suggests an association between the IBD burden and industrialization process. The accelerating urbanization and industrialization process in China, a country with a population of 1.4 billion people, will likely increase the burden of IBD.Copyright © 2023 AGA Institute.

PMID: 37660747
Abstract: Autoinflammatory disorders and autoimmune diseases result from abnormal deviations of innate and adaptive immunity that heterogeneously affect organs and clinical phenotypes. Despite having etiologic and phenotypic differences, these two conditions share the onset of an aberrant inflammatory process. Targeting the main drivers controlling inflammation is useful to treat both autoimmune and autoinflammatory syndromes. TNF-α is a major player in the inflammatory immune response, and anti-TNF-α antibodies have been a revolutionary treatment in many autoimmune disorders. However, production difficulties and high development costs hinder their implementation, and accessibility to their use is still limited. Innovative strategies aimed at overcoming the limitations associated with anti-TNF-α antibodies are being explored, including RNA-based therapies. Here we summarize the central role of TNF-α in immune disorders and how anti-TNF-based immunotherapies changed the therapeutic landscape, albeit with important limitations related to side effects, tolerance, and resistance to therapies. We then outline how nanotechnology has provided the final momentum for the use of nucleic acids in the treatment of autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases, with a focus on inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). The example of IBDs allows the evaluation and discussion of the nucleic acids-based treatments that have been developed, to identify the role that innovative approaches possess in view of the treatment of autoinflammatory disorders and autoimmune diseases.Copyright © 2023.

Keywords: Anxiety; Depression; Fatigue; Immune-mediated inflammatory disease; Pain; Work impairment
PMID: 37660681
Abstract: We investigated the association between distress symptoms (pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety) and work impairment in four patient populations: multiple sclerosis (N = 107), rheumatoid arthritis (N = 40), inflammatory bowel disease (N = 136) and psychiatric disorders (N = 167).Four waves of data collection were completed over three years. The relationship between distress symptoms and overall work impairment was evaluated with univariate and multivariable quantile logistic regression at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles. Models were fit to participant average scores and change scores on distress symptom measures. Covariates included sociodemographic factors, comorbidity, physical disability and cognitive function.In the primary univariate analyses of overall work impairment at the 50th percentile, greater severity of distress symptoms was associated with greater work impairment: pain (average β = 0.27, p < 0.001; change β = 0.08, p < 0.001), fatigue (average β = 0.21, p < 0.001; change β = 0.09, p < 0.001) depression (average, β = 0.35, p < 0.001; change, β = 0.16, p < 0.001), anxiety (average, β = 0.24, p < 0.001; change, β = 0.08, p < 0 0.01). Findings were similar in multivariable analyses.Pain, fatigue, depression, and anxiety symptoms are important determinants of work impairment in persons with immune-mediated diseases and persons with psychiatric disorders. Successful clinical management of these symptoms has potential to improve work-related outcomes across IMIDs.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The relationship between distress symptoms and overall work impairment was evaluated with univariate and multivariable quantile logistic regression at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles. Models were fit to participant average scores and change scores on distress symptom measures. Covariates included sociodemographic factors, comorbidity, physical disability and cognitive function.In the primary univariate analyses of overall work impairment at the 50th percentile, greater severity of distress symptoms was associated with greater work impairment: pain (average \\u03b2\\u00a0=\\u00a00.27, p\\u00a0<\\u00a00.001; change \\u03b2\\u00a0=\\u00a00.08, p\\u00a0<\\u00a00.001), fatigue (average \\u03b2\\u00a0=\\u00a00.21, p\\u00a0<\\u00a00.001; change \\u03b2\\u00a0=\\u00a00.09, p\\u00a0<\\u00a00.001) depression (average, \\u03b2\\u00a0=\\u00a00.35, p\\u00a0<\\u00a00.001; change, \\u03b2\\u00a0=\\u00a00.16, p\\u00a0<\\u00a00.001), anxiety (average, \\u03b2\\u00a0=\\u00a00.24, p\\u00a0<\\u00a00.001; change, \\u03b2\\u00a0=\\u00a00.08, p\\u00a0<\\u00a00 0.01). Findings were similar in multivariable analyses.Pain, fatigue, depression, and anxiety symptoms are important determinants of work impairment in persons with immune-mediated diseases and persons with psychiatric disorders. Successful clinical management of these symptoms has potential to improve work-related outcomes across IMIDs.Copyright \\u00a9 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Abstract: New Zealand (NZ) has one of the world's highest rates of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), however available data are limited to southern, urban regions.To determine the incidence and prevalence of IBD in the Manawatū region of NZ.Patients in the Manawatū region, with a diagnosis of IBD made between 2011 and 2015 were identified. Demographic, diagnostic and disease data were collected, fulfilment of diagnostic criteria was assessed, and incidence rates were calculated. Comparison of disease phenotype and observed diagnostic criteria was made between diagnosis and 12-months following diagnosis. All resident patients with a diagnosis of IBD current on 5 March 2013 were identified, and prevalence rates were calculated.The mean annual age-standardised incidence rates of UC, CD, and IBD were 10.2, 17.0, and 27.2 per 100,000. IBD incidence was highest among those of European ethnicity (24.8 per 100,000), followed by Asian (1.4), and Māori (1.1). IBD incidence in the urban population was 34.0 per 100,000 (95% CI 24.1-46.0) compared to the rural population of 5.6 (95% CI 0.4-22.4). The age-standardised point prevalence of UC, CD, and IBD on 5 March 2013 was 157.7, 231.8, and 397.9 per 100,000, respectively.The incidence and prevalence of IBD in the Manawatū region are comparable to those reported in other Australasian studies. Incidence was lower in Māori, and in the rural population. Follow-up is required to identify any changes in incidence and phenotype, and whether rural residence remains protective.© 2023.

Keywords: clinical effectiveness; inflammatory bowel disease; thioguanine
PMID: 37658804
Abstract: Currently thioguanine is solely used as treatment for inflammatory bowel disease after azathioprine and/or mercaptopurine failure. This study aimed to determine the safety, effectiveness, and 12-month drug survival of thioguanine in thiopurine-naïve patients with inflammatory bowel disease.A retrospective cohort study was performed in thiopurine-naïve patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with thioguanine as first thiopurine derivate. Clinical effectiveness was defined as the continuation of thioguanine without the (re)initiation of concurrent biological therapy, systemic corticosteroids, or a surgical intervention. All adverse events were categorized by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.A total of 114 patients (male 39%, Crohn's disease 53%) were included with a median treatment duration of 25 months and a median thioguanine dosage of 20 mg/d. Clinical effectiveness at 12 months was observed in 53% of patients, and 78% of these responding patients remained responsive until the end of follow-up. During the entire follow-up period, 26 patients were primary nonresponders, 8 had a secondary loss of response, and 11 patients were unable to cease therapy with systemic corticosteroids within 6 months and were therefore classified as nonresponders. After 12 months, thioguanine was still used by 86% of patients. Fifty (44%) patients developed adverse events (grade 1 or 2) and 9 (8%) patients ceased therapy due to the occurrence of adverse events. An infection was documented in 3 patients, none of them requiring hospitalization and pancytopenia occurred in 2 other patients. No signs of nodular regenerative hyperplasia or portal hypertension were observed.At 12 months, first-line thioguanine therapy was clinically effective in 53% of thiopurine-naïve inflammatory bowel disease patients with an acceptable safety profile.© 2023 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

This study aimed to determine the safety, effectiveness, and 12-month drug survival of thioguanine in thiopurine-na\\u00efve patients with inflammatory bowel disease.A retrospective cohort study was performed in thiopurine-na\\u00efve patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with thioguanine as first thiopurine derivate. Clinical effectiveness was defined as the continuation of thioguanine without the (re)initiation of concurrent biological therapy, systemic corticosteroids, or a surgical intervention. All adverse events were categorized by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.A total of 114 patients (male 39%, Crohn\'s disease 53%) were included with a median treatment duration of 25 months and a median thioguanine dosage of 20 mg/d. Clinical effectiveness at 12 months was observed in 53% of patients, and 78% of these responding patients remained responsive until the end of follow-up. During the entire follow-up period, 26 patients were primary nonresponders, 8 had a secondary loss of response, and 11 patients were unable to cease therapy with systemic corticosteroids within 6 months and were therefore classified as nonresponders. After 12 months, thioguanine was still used by 86% of patients. Fifty (44%) patients developed adverse events (grade 1 or 2) and 9 (8%) patients ceased therapy due to the occurrence of adverse events. An infection was documented in 3 patients, none of them requiring hospitalization and pancytopenia occurred in 2 other patients. No signs of nodular regenerative hyperplasia or portal hypertension were observed.At 12 months, first-line thioguanine therapy was clinically effective in 53% of thiopurine-na\\u00efve inflammatory bowel disease patients with an acceptable safety profile.\\u00a9 2023 Crohn\\u2019s & Colitis Foundation.

Keywords: Arginine metabolism; Inflammatory bowel disease; Macrophage; Microbiota; Resveratrol
PMID: 37660064
Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a global disease with a growing public health concern and is associated with a complex interplay of factors, including the microbiota and immune system. Resveratrol, a natural anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent, is known to relieve IBD but the mechanism involved is largely unexplored.This study examines the modulatory effect of resveratrol on intestinal immunity, microbiota, metabolites, and related functions and pathways in the BALB/c mice model of IBD. Mouse RAW264.7 macrophage cell line was used to further explore the involvement of the macrophage-arginine metabolism axis. The treatment outcome was assessed through qRT-PCR, western blot, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and fecal 16S rDNA sequencing and UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS.Results showed that resveratrol treatment significantly reduced disease activity index (DAI), retained mice weight, repaired colon and spleen tissues, upregulated IL-10 and the tight junction proteins Occludin and Claudin 1, and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. Resveratrol reduced the number of dysregulated metabolites and improved the gut microbial community structure and diversity, including reversing changes in the phyla Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes, increasing 'beneficial' genera, and decreasing potential pathogens such as Lachnoclostridium, Acinobacter, and Serratia. Arginine-proline metabolism was significantly different between the colitis-treated and untreated groups. In the colon mucosa and RAW264.7 macrophage, resveratrol regulated arginine metabolism towards colon protection by increasing Arg1 and Slc6a8 and decreasing iNOS.This uncovers a previously unknown mechanism of resveratrol treatment in IBD and provides the microbiota-macrophage-arginine metabolism axis as a potential therapeutic target for intestinal inflammation.© 2023.

DEBUG:root:Input text: Title: A prospective longitudinal cohort study on risk factors for COVID-19 vaccination failure (RisCoin): methods, procedures and characterization of the cohort.
Keywords: 
PMID: 37659994
Abstract: The primary objective of the RisCoin study was to investigate the interplay of genetic, metabolic, and lifestyle factors as well as stress levels on influencing the humoral immune response after at least two COVID-19 vaccinations, primarily with mRNAs, and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections during follow-up. Here, we describe the study design, procedures, and study population. RisCoin is a prospective, monocentric, longitudinal, observational cohort study. Between October and December 2021, 4515 participants with at least two COVID-19 vaccinations, primarily BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, were enrolled at the LMU University Hospital of Munich, thereof > 4000 healthcare workers (HCW), 180 patients with inflammatory bowel disease under immunosuppression, and 119 patients with mental disorders. At enrollment, blood and saliva samples were collected to measure anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, their neutralizing capacity against Omicron-BA.1, stress markers, metabolomics, and genetics. To ensure the confidential handling of sensitive data of study participants, we developed a data protection concept and a mobile application for two-way communication. The application allowed continuous data reporting, including breakthrough infections by the participants, despite irreversible anonymization. Up to 1500 participants attended follow-up visits every two to six months after enrollment. The study gathered comprehensive data and bio-samples of a large representative HCW cohort and two patient groups allowing analyses of complex interactions. Our data protection concept combined with the mobile application proves the feasibility of longitudinal assessment of anonymized participants. Our concept may serve as a blueprint for other studies handling sensitive data on HCW.© 2023. The Author(s).

Keywords: Henoch-Schönlein purpura; Immune thrombocytopenia; Inflammatory bowel disease; Mendelian randomization
PMID: 37659917
Abstract: Emerging clinical evidence has been discovered associating Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). However, it is unclear whether a cause-effect relationship exists between them. We aimed to examine the casual effect of IBD on the risk of HSP and ITP.Based on summary statistics from International IBD Genetics (IIBDG) Consortium and FinnGen study, a two-sample Mendelian randomization study was carried out to determine whether IBD including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) is causally related to HSP, ITP or secondary thrombocytopenia. To support the results, a variety of sensitivity analyses were performed.Significant causal relationships between IBD and HSP (odds ratios = 1.20, 95% confidence interval: 1.07-1.36, adjusted P = 0.006) and ITP (odds ratios =1.22, 95% confidence interval: 1.08-1.38, adjusted P = 0.006) were found. Both genetically predicted UC and CD were positively related with ITP, while CD alone may be responsible for the higher risk of HSP. Besides, no significant association was observed between IBD and secondary thrombocytopenia.The results of this Mendelian randomization study supported the causal association of IBD with HSP and ITP. Taken together, our findings may present implications for management of IBD.Copyright © 2023 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

PMID: 37659831
Abstract: β(2 → 1)-β(2 → 6) branched graminan-type fructans (GTFs) and β(2 → 1) linear fructans (ITFs) possess immunomodulatory properties and protect human intestinal barrier function, however the mechanisms underlying these effects are not well studied. Herein, GTFs and ITFs effects with different degree of polymerization (DP) values on tight junctions (TJs) genes CLDN-1, -2 and -3, CDH1, OCLN and TJP1 were studied in Caco-2 gut epithelial cells, under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions. Also, cytokine production in dendritic cells (DCs) was studied. Higher DP fructans decreased the expression of the pore forming CLDN-2. Higher DP GTFs enhanced CLDN-3, OCLN, and TJP-1. Fructans prevented mRNA dysregulation of CLDN-1, -2 and -3 induced by the barrier disruptors A23187 and deoxynivalenol in a fructan-type dependent fashion. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines MCP-1/CCL2, MIP-1α/CCL3 and TNFα by DCs was also attenuated in a fructan-type dependent manner and was strongly attenuated by DCs cultured with medium of Caco-2 cells which were pre-exposed to fructans. Our data show that specific fructans have TJs and DCs modulating effects and contribute to gut homeostasis. This might serve to design effective dietary means to prevent intestinal inflammation.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.

Keywords: Advanced therapy; Interleukin-23 p19 subunit antagonist; QUASAR; Ulcerative colitis
PMID: 37659673
Abstract: The QUASAR Phase 2b Induction Study evaluated the efficacy and safety of guselkumab, an interleukin-23p19 subunit antagonist, in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) with prior inadequate response and/or intolerance to corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, or advanced therapy.In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, induction study, patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive intravenous guselkumab 200 or 400 mg or placebo at weeks 0/4/8. The primary endpoint was clinical response (compared with baseline, modified Mayo score decrease ≥30% and ≥2 points, rectal bleeding subscore ≥1-point decrease or subscore of 0/1) at week 12. Guselkumab and placebo week-12 clinical nonresponders received subcutaneous or intravenous guselkumab 200 mg, respectively, at weeks 12/16/20 (uncontrolled study period).The primary analysis population included patients with baseline modified Mayo scores ≥5 and ≤9 (intravenous guselkumab 200 mg, N=101; 400 mg, N=107; placebo, N=105). Week-12 clinical response percentage was greater with guselkumab 200 mg (61.4%) and 400 mg (60.7%) versus placebo (27.6%; both P<.001). Greater proportions of guselkumab-treated versus placebo-treated patients achieved all major secondary endpoints (clinical remission, symptomatic remission, endoscopic improvement, histo-endoscopic mucosal improvement, and endoscopic normalization) at week 12. Among guselkumab week-12 clinical nonresponders, 54.3% and 50.0% of patients in the 200 and 400 mg groups, respectively, achieved clinical response at week 24. Safety was similar among guselkumab and placebo groups.Guselkumab intravenous induction was effective versus placebo in patients with moderately to severely active UC. Guselkumab was safe, and efficacy and safety were similar between guselkumab dose groups.Copyright © 2023 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Keywords: CGD; Chronic granulomatous disease; IBD; NADPH oxidase; dysbiosis; inborn errors of immunity; inflammatory bowel disease; intestinal inflammation; metabolome; microbiome; primary immune deficiency
PMID: 37659505
Abstract: CGD is caused by defects in any of the 6 subunits forming the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex 2 (NOX2), leading to severely reduced or absent phagocyte-derived ROS production. Almost 50% of patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) have IBD (CGD-IBD). While conventional IBD therapies can treat CGD-IBD, their benefits must be weighed against the risk of infection. Understanding the impact of NOX2 defects on the intestinal microbiota may lead to the identification of novel CGD-IBD treatments.To identify microbiome and metabolome signatures that can distinguish patients with CGD and CGD-IBD.We conducted a cross-sectional, observational study of 79 patients with CGD, 8 pathogenic variant carriers and 19 healthy controls followed at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (NIH CC). We profiled the intestinal microbiome (amplicon sequencing) and stool metabolome, and validated our findings in a second cohort of 36 CGD patients recruited through the Primary Immune Deficiency Treatment Consortium (PIDTC).We identified distinct intestinal microbiome and metabolome profiles in patients with CGD compared to healthy individuals. We observed enrichment for Erysipelatoclostridium spp., Sellimonas spp. and Lachnoclostridium spp. in CGD stool samples. Despite differences in bacterial alpha and beta diversity between the NIH CC and PIDTC cohorts, several taxa correlated significantly between both cohorts. We further demonstrated that patients with CGD-IBD have a distinct microbiome and metabolome profile compared to patients without CGD-IBD.Intestinal microbiome and metabolome signatures distinguished patients with CGD and CGD-IBD, and identified potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.Copyright © 2023.

Keywords: fisetin; silk sericin; ulcerative colitis
PMID: 37658682
Abstract: Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease with a high recurrence rate. Natural phytochemical compounds are increasingly being considered as preventative and supportive treatments for this condition. However, the poor water solubility and stability of many of these compounds limit their effectiveness in vivo. To address this issue, fisetin (FT), a natural phytochemical with poor solubility, is stabilized using silk sericin (SS) to create a composite (SS/FT). The therapeutic potential of the SS/FT on ulcerative colitis is extensively investigated, and the results showed that it effectively alleviated the body weight loss and colon length shortening induced by dextran sulfate sodium. Notably, SS/FT downregulated the immune response, decreased colonic histopathological lesions, and reduced the cGAS/STING signal activation. This suggests that SS/FT may offer a promising therapy for treating ulcerative colitis.© 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

PMID: 37658187
Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic, dysregulated inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. The heterogeneity of IBD is reflected through two major subtypes, Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). CD and UC differ across symptomatic presentation, histology, immune responses, and treatment. While colitis mouse models have been influential in deciphering IBD pathogenesis, no single model captures the full heterogeneity of clinical disease. The translational capacity of mouse models may be augmented by shifting to multi-mouse model studies that aggregate analysis across various well-controlled phenotypes. Here, we evaluate the value of histology in multi-mouse model characterizations by building upon a previous pipeline that detects histological disease classes in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained murine colons. Specifically, we map immune marker positivity across serially-sectioned slides to H&E histological classes across the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) chemical induction model and the intestinal epithelium-specific, inducible Villin-CreERT2;Klf5fl/fl (Klf5ΔIND) genetic model.

The heterogeneity of IBD is reflected through two major subtypes, Crohn\'s Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). CD and UC differ across symptomatic presentation, histology, immune responses, and treatment. While colitis mouse models have been influential in deciphering IBD pathogenesis, no single model captures the full heterogeneity of clinical disease. The translational capacity of mouse models may be augmented by shifting to multi-mouse model studies that aggregate analysis across various well-controlled phenotypes. Here, we evaluate the value of histology in multi-mouse model characterizations by building upon a previous pipeline that detects histological disease classes in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained murine colons. Specifically, we map immune marker positivity across serially-sectioned slides to H&E histological classes across the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) chemical induction model and the intestinal epithelium-specific, inducible Villin-CreERT2;Klf5fl/fl (Klf5\\u0394IND) genetic model.

Keywords: 
PMID: 37658057
Abstract: Accurate species identification and abundance estimation are critical for the interpretation of whole metagenome sequencing (WMS) data. Yet, existing metagenomic profilers suffer from false-positive identifications, which can account for more than 90% of total identified species. Here, by leveraging species-specific Type IIB restriction endonuclease digestion sites as reference instead of universal markers or whole microbial genomes, we present a metagenomic profiler, MAP2B (MetAgenomic Profiler based on type IIB restriction sites), to resolve those issues. We first illustrate the pitfalls of using relative abundance as the only feature in determining false positives. We then propose a feature set to distinguish false positives from true positives, and using simulated metagenomes from CAMI2, we establish a false-positive recognition model. By benchmarking the performance in metagenomic profiling using a simulation dataset with varying sequencing depth and species richness, we illustrate the superior performance of MAP2B over existing metagenomic profilers in species identification. We further test the performance of MAP2B using real WMS data from an ATCC mock community, confirming its superior precision against sequencing depth. Finally, by leveraging WMS data from an IBD cohort, we demonstrate the taxonomic features generated by MAP2B can better discriminate IBD and predict metabolomic profiles.© 2023.

Keywords: 
PMID: 37658034
Abstract: We analyzed the complication rates and outcomes in patients with gastrointestinal disorders who had undergone maxillofacial surgery.We retrospectively analyzed 289 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 142 with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and 42 with celiac disease (452 total) who had undergone oral and/or maxillofacial surgery. We examined their characteristics, medications they had taken, surgeries they had undergone, and complications they had experienced. Based on the results of univariate analysis, we selected variables for multivariable logistic regression to identify independent predictors of postoperative complications.We found a complication rate of 10% in patients with IBD, 6.9% in patients with GERD, and 9.5% in patients with celiac disease. Dentoalveolar treatment was significantly associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications in patients with IBD and GERD.Oral and/or maxillofacial surgery is safe in most patients with IBD, GERD, and celiac disease. Preventive measures for postoperative complications should be considered in patients with IBD and GERD undergoing dentoalveolar treatment.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

PMID: 37657734
Abstract: To compare plasma glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) concentrations in dogs with treatment-naïve chronic enteropathies to healthy dogs and describe changes over time in dogs with chronic enteropathies (CE).18 client-owned dogs with treatment-naïve CE and 17 client-owned healthy control dogs.This was a prospective study. Fasting, 1-hour, and 3-hour postprandial plasma GLP-2 concentrations were measured using a commercial immunoassay in healthy dogs and dogs with uncontrolled, untreated CE. Repeated fasting and postprandial plasma concentrations were measured in dogs with CE after initiating directed treatment for gastrointestinal disease.There was no significant difference between fasting and postprandial GLP-2 concentrations in either group. Dogs with treatment-naïve CE had lower fasting (mean, 424 ± SD 176 pg/mL) plasma GLP-2 concentrations than healthy dogs (1184 ± 435 pg/mL; P < .0001). Fasted plasma GLP-2 concentrations (624 ± 314 pg/mL) remained lower in dogs with CE than in healthy dogs at recheck.Dogs with CE have disrupted GLP-2 secretion. Future studies are required to evaluate subsets of CE and changes in response to therapy.

Dogs with treatment-na\\u00efve CE had lower fasting (mean, 424 \\u00b1 SD 176 pg/mL) plasma GLP-2 concentrations than healthy dogs (1184 \\u00b1 435 pg/mL; P < .0001). Fasted plasma GLP-2 concentrations (624 \\u00b1 314 pg/mL) remained lower in dogs with CE than in healthy dogs at recheck.Dogs with CE have disrupted GLP-2 secretion. Future studies are required to evaluate subsets of CE and changes in response to therapy.\\n\\n===\\n\\n"}], "max_tokens": 3000}' message='Post details'

Keywords: Anxiety; Cognitive behavioral therapy; Depression; Mental health; Meta-analysis
PMID: 37657513
Abstract: We aim to assess the roles of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in improving quality of life (QoL) and mental health in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. In this study, PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINfO, and the Cochrane Library databases were used for locating proper randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (to October 2022). IBD Questionnaire (IBDQ), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety Scale (HADS-A), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Depression Scale (HADS-D) were selected for analysis. Finally, nine eligible RCTs were included in this study. The analysis of these RCTs showed that CBT significantly increased IBDQ scores (standardized mean difference (SMD): 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI): [0.05, 0.47], p = 0.02), decreased HADS-A (SMD: -0.25, 95% CI: [-0.45, -0.05], p = 0.01), HADS-D (SMD: -0.17, 95% CI: [-0.31, -0.02], p = 0.02) scores. The result of subgroup analysis, based on treatment duration, showed that long-term CBT (≥ 12 weeks; SMD: 0.23, 95% CI: [0.05, 0.41]; p = 0.01; I2 = 28%) increased IBDQ scores. Thus, CBT is helpful for alleviating anxiety, depression and enhancing QoL in IBD patients.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Keywords: Amoebiasis; Bowel obstruction; Case report; Immune compromise; Infectious disease
PMID: 37657387
Abstract: Entamoeba histolytica is an anaerobic protozoan. It infects humans causing Amoebiasis. Most infections are asymptomatic; however, clinical manifestations include intestinal or extraintestinal. In rare instances, patients can present with Ameboma: a mass of granulation tissue consisting of a core of inflammation with peripheral fibrosis related to chronic amoebic infection usually found in the cecum/ascending colon.A 50-year-old patient presented with signs and symptoms of bowel obstruction. He had raised inflammatory markers and was HIV positive on treatment and virally suppressed. At laparotomy a hepatic flexure stricture with desmoid reaction, and wall thickening with induration at the mesenteric border of mid-transverse colon was found, with disseminated nodular disease. Histology confirmed entamoeba histolytica infection.The parasite exists in two forms: a cyst stage and a trophozoite stage: the form causing invasive disease. The presentation of intestinal amoebiasis ranges from an asymptomatic carrier state, colitis, to abscess formation and bowel perforation The management principles: to eliminate the invading trophozoites and eradicate the organism's intestinal carriage and manage complications such as obstruction, fulminant colitis, or toxic megacolon with surgery.This case identifies a rare cause of bowel obstruction in a patient without a travel history. Even with the lack of significant risk factors other than HIV, clinicians should be aware of the infective causes of colonic mass/stricture outside of malignant causes. Entamoeba histolytica is an infection of impoverished communities in developing countries, it should remain high on our differential for tumour-like granulation tissue in the colon.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Keywords: 
PMID: 37657036
Abstract: Currently, there is no comprehensive bibliometric study in the literature on Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to analyze articles published on CD using bibliometric and statistical methods. The aim was to identify current research trends, show global productivity, and determine important players such as countries, journals, institutions, and authors. A total of 16,216 articles published on CD between 1980 and 2022 were analyzed using various statistical and bibliometric methods. Bibliometric network visualization maps were used to perform trend topic analysis, citation analysis, and international collaboration analysis. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used for correlation analysis. The top 3 contributing countries to the literature were the United States of America (USA) (n = 4344, 26.7%), the United Kingdom (UK) (n = 2036, 12.5%) and Germany (n = 1334, 8.2%). The most active institutions were Udice French Research Universities (n = 696), Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (n = 570), and Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale Inserm (n = 479). The most productive journals were Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (n = 1100), Journal of Crohn's & Colitis (n = 579), and Gut (n = 510). The most prolific author was Colombel JF. (n = 290). The most frequently researched topics from past to present included infliximab, ulcerative colitis, surgery, pediatrics, adalimumab, magnetic resonance imaging, inflammation, perianal CD/perianal fistula, azathioprine, magnetic resonance enterography, small bowel, stricture/strictureplasty, recurrence, therapy/treatment, ustekinumab, mucosal healing, biomarkers, fistula, quality of life, ultrasonography, epidemiology, capsule endoscopy, laparoscopic surgery/laparoscopy, endoscopy, disease activity, postoperative recurrence, and the Nucleotide Binding Oligomerization Domain Containing 2 gene. We have seen an exponential increase in worldwide publications on CD. In recent years, the major research topics related to CD have been ustekinumab, vedolizumab, fecal calprotectin, therapeutic drug monitoring, biologics, biomarkers, exclusive enteral nutrition, microbiome/microbiota, magnetic resonance enterography, anti-TNF, postoperative complications, and mucosal healing. We determined that countries with large economies, particularly the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Canada, Italy, Japan and China, have taken the lead in research contributions to the development of CD literature.Copyright © 2023 the Author(s).

DEBUG:root:Input text: Title: Predicting the anti-inflammatory mechanism of Radix Astragali using network pharmacology and molecular docking.
Keywords: 
PMID: 37657026
Abstract: According to current research, the primary active ingredients of Radix Astragali (RA), such as saponins, flavonoids, and polysaccharides, play an important role in anti-inflammatory effects. However, the exact molecular mechanism underlying the action was not elucidated to date. Our research attempted to determine the active components in RA and to investigate the interaction between the active components and targets involved in the anti-inflammation activity by network pharmacology and molecular docking. The active components and targets of RA were screened out by TCMSP. Thereafter, through the "anti-inflammation effect" and "inflammation" as the keywords, disease targets were obtained from the GeneCards database. The PPI network was constructed with Cytoscape 3.8.0 software to screen core targets. The GO function and KEGG analysis were enriched and analyzed through the Metascape platform, obtaining the 3-dimensional view of the core targets from the PDB database, and then, performing molecular docking in AutoDock Vina, a heatmap was constructed using the binding free energies in GraphPad Prism 8. The Discovery Studio software was used for docking analysis, and eventually, the docking results were visualized. We also explored the targets and signaling pathways of Astragaloside IV acting on anti-inflammatory effects via constructing compound-disease-target-pathway network. 18 active components and 45 targets of RA were screened out. The main anti-inflammatory active components of RA were quercetin, Astragaloside IV, kaempferol, 7-O-methylisomucronulatol, and formononetin, and the strongly interacting core proteins were TNF, IL6, IL1B, TLR4, CXCL8, CCL2, IL10, VEGFA, and MMP9. The signal pathways mainly involved include Lipid and atherosclerosis, IL-17 signaling pathway, Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, and TNF signaling pathway. Moreover, molecular docking showed that the 2 most active compounds, Astragaloside IV and kaempferol, could efficiently bind with the targets TNF, TLR4, and IL10. Astragaloside IV may play a part in anti-inflammatory effects through pathways such as HIF-1 signaling pathway, Inflammatory bowel disease and Hepatitis B ect. RA exhibits the characteristic of multicomponent and multitarget synergistic effects in exerting anti-inflammatory effects and the effective component of RA is Astragaloside IV, targeting TNF, TLR4, and IL10.Copyright © 2023 the Author(s).

DEBUG:root:Input text: Title: Gut Microbiota Composition in Long-Remission Ulcerative Colitis is Close to a Healthy Gut Microbiota.
Keywords: Inflammatory bowel disease; gut microbiota; remission
PMID: 37655859
Abstract: Microbiome studies report low gut microbial richness and diversity in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. We explored whether UC patients who reach long-term clinical, endoscopic, and histological remission show a gut microbial ecosystem that is similar to healthy individuals.We collected 184 stool samples from 111 individuals (UC patients in long remission, short remission, flare, and healthy control subjects). Microbiota was analyzed by amplicon sequencing (16S ribosomal RNA) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction for specific taxa. All UC remission patients were followed-up for 2 years.A drop in species diversity and richness, underrepresentation of butyrate producers, and gain of potentially harmful bacteria were significantly detected in samples from disease-flare and short-remission patients. In contrast, Chao1 and Shannon indexes of diversity did not differ among patients in long remission and healthy control subjects. Long-remission patients also presented fecal bacterial composition closer to that in healthy control subjects. There was a positive correlation between Akkermansia muciniphila abundance and time in remission (rs = 0.53, P < .001). Logistic regression analysis showed that a high Shannon index (odds ratio, 4.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-20.6) or presence of A. muciniphila (odds ratio, 4.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-29.08) in fecal samples at entry was independently associated with clinical remission over a follow-up period of 24 months.UC patients who achieve long-term remission show evidence of substantial recovery of the gut microbial ecosystem in terms of diversity and composition. Recovery may just reflect adequate control of inflammatory activity, but higher bacterial diversity or the presence of A. muciniphila in fecal samples predicts flare-free outcomes.© The Author(s) 2023.

Keywords: DSS colitis; Ring1a; intestinal microbiota; mucosal immune system; scRNA-seq
PMID: 37655448
Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a prominent chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disorder, yet its etiology remains poorly comprehended, encompassing intricate interactions between genetics, immunity, and the gut microbiome. This study uncovers a novel colitis-associated risk gene, namely Ring1a, which regulates the mucosal immune response and intestinal microbiota. Ring1a deficiency exacerbates colitis by impairing the immune system. Concomitantly, Ring1a deficiency led to a Prevotella genus-dominated pathogenic microenvironment, which can be horizontally transmitted to co-housed wild type (WT) mice, consequently intensifying dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. Furthermore, we identified a potential mechanism linking the altered microbiota in Ring1aKO mice to decreased levels of IgA, and we demonstrated that metronidazole administration could ameliorate colitis progression in Ring1aKO mice, likely by reducing the abundance of the Prevotella genus. We also elucidated the immune landscape of DSS colitis and revealed the disruption of intestinal immune homeostasis associated with Ring1a deficiency. Collectively, these findings highlight Ring1a as a prospective candidate risk gene for colitis and suggest metronidazole as a potential therapeutic option for clinically managing Prevotella genus-dominated colitis.

Keywords: Crohn’s disease; biologic therapy; effectiveness; intravenous dose; ustekinumab
PMID: 37655058
Abstract: Ustekinumab (UST) is indicated for the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Despite having shown clinical effectiveness in the real world, some patients may lose response over time or need a higher dose to achieve it. In this context, UST intravenous (IV) maintenance has been proposed.The primary endpoint of our study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of maintenance IV UST treatment in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) patients who present with partial response or loss of response to subcutaneous (SC) UST.We performed a monocentric observational retrospective study including patients with active IBD on maintenance treatment with IV UST.The clinical response and remission was analyzed at week 12, defined as either Harvey-Bradshaw Index ⩽ 4 for CD or partial Mayo Score ⩽ 2 for UC. The reduction of objective markers of disease activity, fecal calprotectin, and C-reactive protein was evaluated. Moreover, UST trough levels were measured pre- and post-UST IV maintenance and any adverse events were assessed.We included 23 patients. Clinical remission at week 12 was achieved by 43.5% of the patients. The proportion of patients in clinical response after 12 weeks on UST IV maintenance was 82.6%. After a median follow-up of 9.3 months all patients remained on IV UST maintenance.

Despite having shown clinical effectiveness in the real world, some patients may lose response over time or need a higher dose to achieve it. In this context, UST intravenous (IV) maintenance has been proposed.The primary endpoint of our study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of maintenance IV UST treatment in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) patients who present with partial response or loss of response to subcutaneous (SC) UST.We performed a monocentric observational retrospective study including patients with active IBD on maintenance treatment with IV UST.The clinical response and remission was analyzed at week 12, defined as either Harvey-Bradshaw Index\\u2009\\u2a7d\\u20094 for CD or partial Mayo Score\\u2009\\u2a7d\\u20092 for UC. The reduction of objective markers of disease activity, fecal calprotectin, and C-reactive protein was evaluated. Moreover, UST trough levels were measured pre- and post-UST IV maintenance and any adverse events were assessed.We included 23 patients. Clinical remission at week 12 was achieved by 43.5% of the patients. The proportion of patients in clinical response after 12\\u2009weeks on UST IV maintenance was 82.6%. After a median follow-up of 9.3\\u2009months all patients remained on IV UST maintenance. No adverse events were recorded in any patient for the duration of the study.IV UST maintenance treatment was able to recapture response in most of the patients who had lost response to SC maintenance.\\u00a9 The Author(s), 2023.\\n\\n===\\n\\n"}], "max_tokens": 3000}' message='Post details'

PMID: 37655055
Abstract: Methotrexate monotherapy is recommended as a maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease (CD). However, long-term follow-up data are scarce.We aimed to examine the effectiveness and tolerability of methotrexate monotherapy in 94 CD patients from three inflammatory bowel disease Clinics in Korea.This was a multicenter retrospective observational study.Patients with active CD treated with methotrexate monotherapy were included. Clinical characteristics, laboratory indicators, endoscopy indices were evaluated at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months. Independent factors associated with long-term clinical and endoscopic outcomes were determined.Methotrexate was administered orally (70.2%) or parenterally (29.8%). The mean methotrexate induction dose was 15.3 ± 0.4 mg/week, and the mean duration of therapy was 26.2 months. Of 76 patients who were treated for >6 months, the clinical remission rates were 76.3%, 74.6%, and 80.0% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively, by per-protocol analysis. The mean CRP levels were 7.5 ± 1.3, 5.3 ± 1.2, 3.8 ± 0.7, and 2.6 ± 0.5 mg/L at 0, 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. Of 31 patients who underwent follow-up endoscopy after 27.5 months, the endoscopic remission rate was 38.7%. Baseline hemoglobin level <10 g/dL was a significant independent factor negatively associated with clinical remission at 6 [odds ratio (OR): 0.023, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.003-0.206, p = 0.001] and 12 (OR: 0.079, 95% CI: 0.009-0.699, p = 0.023) months. Parenteral administration was a significant independent factor positively associated with clinical remission (OR: 11.231, 95% CI: 1.027-122.811, p = 0.047) and endoscopic remission (hazard ratio: 4.711, 95% CI: 1.398-15.874, p = 0.012) at 12 months.Methotrexate monotherapy was effective and tolerable as a maintenance therapy in CD patients.© The Author(s), 2023.

Keywords: carcinoma; chaperone‐mediated autophagy; neurodegenerative disorders; signaling regulation; therapeutic potential
PMID: 37655052
Abstract: Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a lysosomal degradation pathway that eliminates substrate proteins through heat-shock cognate protein 70 recognition and lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A-assisted translocation. It is distinct from macroautophagy and microautophagy. In recent years, the regulatory mechanisms of CMA have been gradually enriched, including the newly discovered NRF2 and p38-TFEB signaling, as positive and negative regulatory pathways of CMA, respectively. Normal CMA activity is involved in the regulation of metabolism, aging, immunity, cell cycle, and other physiological processes, while CMA dysfunction may be involved in the occurrence of neurodegenerative disorders, tumors, intestinal disorders, atherosclerosis, and so on, which provides potential targets for the treatment and prediction of related diseases. This article describes the general process of CMA and its role in physiological activities and summarizes the connection between CMA and macroautophagy. In addition, human diseases that concern the dysfunction or protective role of CMA are discussed. Our review deepens the understanding of the mechanisms and physiological functions of CMA and provides a summary of past CMA research and a vision of future directions.© 2023 The Authors.

Keywords: Collagen; Docking; Fucoidan; Mesalamine; Ulcerative colitis; in situ hydrogel
PMID: 37654823
Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes chronic intestinal inflammation in gastrointestinal (GI) tract, mainly in innermost lining of colonic mucosa. In any of the UC drug therapy regimens, maintaining remission is challenging and about 20-40% of patients don't respond to conventional UC medications, namely, amino salicylates, steroids and immunosuppressive drugs. These agents can weaken the patient's immune system thus enhancing the risk of infectious diseases. Therefore, in our exploration we probed to test marine-derived anti-inflammatory compounds as potential agents to treat UC. Fucoidan, a complex fucose-rich sulphated polysaccharide originated in edible brown algae with known anti-inflammatory properties was isolated from Turbinaria ornate. Collagen (Achillis tendon) is another agent that may provide a beneficial effect in wound healing and tissue regeneration. Collagen was also reported to possess anti-UC properties. Collagen has a limitation of being in solution form even at high concentrations. We therefore formulated fucoidan with collagen that underwent a sol-gel transition and yielded a gel like consistency in situ. This formulation showed sustained release of fucoidan for about 12 hours. The fucoidan, collagen and the fucoidan-collagen formulation were tested in the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) induced colitis model in mice. In comparison to the vehicle treated group, fucoidan-collagen hydrogel formulation led to significant reduction in the clinical scores and rectal bleeding, which was higher than the reference standard, mesalamine and those seen with fucoidan and collagen given alone.© 2022 Biomedical Informatics.

DEBUG:root:Input text: Title: Celastrol attenuates human parvovirus B19 NS1‑induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages.
Keywords: celastrol; human parvovirus B19; inflammasome; inflammation; macrophages; non‑structural protein 1
PMID: 37654202
Abstract: Human parvovirus B19 (B19V) has been strongly associated with a variety of inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease and systemic lupus erythematosus. Non‑structural protein 1 (NS1) of B19V has been demonstrated to play essential roles in the pathological processes of B19V infection due to its regulatory properties on inflammatory cytokines. Celastrol, a quinone methide isolated from Tripterygium wilfordii, has displayed substantial potential in treating inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis and RA. However, little is known about the effects of celastrol on B19V NS1‑induced inflammation. Therefore, cell viability assay, migration assay, phagocytosis analysis, zymography assay, ELISA and immunoblotting were conducted to verify the influences of celastrol on macrophages. The present study reported the attenuating effects of celastrol on B19V NS1‑induced inflammatory responses in macrophages derived from human acute monocytic leukemia cell lines, U937 and THP‑1. Although the migration was not significantly decreased by celastrol in both U937 and THP‑1 macrophages, significantly decreased viability, migration and phagocytosis were detected in both B19V NS1‑activated U937 and THP‑1 macrophages in the presence of celastrol. Additionally, celastrol significantly decreased MMP‑9 activity and the levels of inflammatory cytokines, including IL‑6, TNF‑α and IL‑1β, in B19V NS1‑activated U937 and THP‑1 cells. Notably, significantly decreased levels of NLR family pyrin domain‑containing 3, apoptosis‑associated speck‑like, caspase‑1 and IL‑18 proteins were observed in both B19V NS1‑activated U937 and THP‑1 cells in the presence of celastrol, indicating the involvement of the inflammasome pathway. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to report on the attenuating effects of celastrol on B19V NS1‑induced inflammatory responses in macrophages, suggesting a therapeutic role for celastrol in B19V NS1‑related inflammatory diseases.

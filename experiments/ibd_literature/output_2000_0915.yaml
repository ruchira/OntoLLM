  Title: Medication Formulation Preference of Mild and Moderate Ulcerative Colitis Patients: a European Survey.
  Keywords: Adherence; Compliance; Mesalazine; Oral therapy; Patient preference; Ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37711959
  Abstract: Patient adherence is a major challenge for the successful management of any chronic disease, and ulcerative colitis (UC) is no exception. Patient adherence is closely related to patient preference of medication and formulation used.The aim of this study was to investigate patient and physician perspectives around UC treatment preference.This study was conducted in France, Germany, Spain, and the UK. Physicians and UK inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) nurses answered an online questionnaire. In addition, adult mild-to-moderate UC patients, treated with oral mesalazine, were invited to answer a 30-min online survey which included a conjoint exercise.400 patients, 160 physicians, and 20 IBD nurses participated in the survey. 68% of patients were taking tablets and 32% granules. Physicians stated that from their perspective patients are more adherent to tablets than granules (76% vs. 24%), patients tended to have better relief of symptoms with tablets (69% vs. 31%), and patients found tablets to be the most convenient formulation (61% vs. 39%). From the patients' perspective, when questioned which formulation they prefer, 58% answered tablets, 37% granules, and 5% none of these. When patients were asked about some negative attributes of tablets, the highest agreement was for "I would like to take fewer each day" (6.1/10) and "I wish I could take fewer at a time" (5.4/10).The majority of UC patients in this survey prefer the tablet formulation. A high strength tablet overcoming the high pill burden could be a good solution to address patient expectations.© 2023 The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.

  Title: High prevalence of Mucosa-Associated extended-spectrum β-Lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae among Iranain patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
  Keywords: Crohn’s disease; Enterobacterales; Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae; Extended-spectrum β-lactamase; Inflammatory bowel disease; Ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37710309
  Abstract: Several pieces of evidence suggest that certain pathobionts belonging to Enterobacterales are associated with the development and progression of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) ESBLs are frequently found in the Enterobacterales members, particularly in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp., and might trigger antibiotic-induced perturbations of the intestinal microbiota and led to more severe disease activity in IBD. Therefore, the severity of IBD could be influenced by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales, and hence, this study aimed to investigate the presence of ESBLs and carbapenemases among mucosa-associated E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from colonic biopsies of Iranian patients with IBD.In this cross-sectional study, E. coli and K. pneumoniae were isolated from inflamed ileum and/or colon tissue of patients with IBD, including Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), during colonoscopy. Demographic data and clinical characteristics were recorded, and UC and CD disease activity and extent were evaluated according to the full Mayo score and Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI), respectively. Phenotypic and molecular detection of ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were carried out. Disease activity and other clinical and microbial features were compared in patients with and without gut colonization with ESBL producers.A total of 83 IBD patients, including 67 UC and 16 CD, were enrolled in the initial analysis. Intestinal colonization with ESBL-producing E. coli and/or Klebsiella pneumoniae was found in 37 (55.2%) of UC and 9 (56.2%) of DC patients - mostly harbored E. coli containing the blaCTX-M and blaTEM genes. UC patients with intestinal colonization with ESBL-producers had more severe disease compared with patients without colonization. Moreover, 10.2% of tested E. coli and 34.8% of K. pneumoniea were recognized as potential carbapenemase producers.Intestinal colonization with ESBL producers could arise disease activity in IBD patients. Further large-scale case-control studies should be performed to investigate the possible confounding factors that could contribute to this outcome.© 2023.

  Title: Gynecologic Conditions in a Cohort with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Descriptive Analysis.
  Keywords: Crohn’s disease; Gynecological conditions; IBD; Ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37709680
  Abstract: Past studies have demonstrated that women with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have a higher risk of gynecological conditions than do women without it. We aimed to characterize the gynecological histories of Hispanic Women living in Puerto Rico with IBD.We identified women, aged 21 to 55 years, with a confirmed IBD diagnosis and receiving follow-up care from the University of Puerto Rico IBD clinics from 2017 through 2020. A questionnaire was administered to acquire sociodemographics, family history, past medical history, IBD diagnosis, and gynecologic aspects.One hundred eighty-six women were recruited. Fifty-three (28%) patients had ulcerative colitis, while 133 (72%) had Crohn's disease. Fifty-six percent of all the participants had a chronic illness in addition to than their IBD. Seventy-four out of 186 patients reported having had at least 1 late period within the last 12 months. Fifty-three (28%) described their period patterns as irregular. Thirty-nine (21%) of the patients reported having been vaccinated against human papillomavirus (HPV), and 8 (4%) had been infected by it. Nine out of 186 (5%) patients reported suffering from infertility.The results showed that our Hispanic patients (living in Puerto Rico) had a prevalence of irregular menstrual cycles that was similar to that observed in other populations. On the other hand, the presence of HPV, infertility, and cervical cancer were lower and the frequency of Papanicolaou smears performed higher than what has been seen in the continental United States, suggesting that this topic should be investigated in future studies.

  Abstract: Under physiological or pathological conditions, transient receptor potential (TRP) channel vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) and TRP ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) possess the ability to detect a vast array of stimuli and execute diverse functions. Interestingly, increasing works have reported that activation of TRPV1 and TRPA1 could also be beneficial for ameliorating postoperative ileus (POI). Increasing research has revealed that the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is rich in TRPV1/TRPA1, which can be stimulated by capsaicin, allicin and other compounds. This activation stimulates a variety of neurotransmitters, leading to increased intestinal motility and providing protective effects against GI injury. POI is the most common emergent complication following abdominal and pelvic surgery, and is characterized by postoperative bowel dysfunction, pain, and inflammatory responses. It is noteworthy that natural herbs are gradually gaining recognition as a potential therapeutic option for POI due to the lack of effective pharmacological interventions. Therefore, the focus of this paper is on the TRPV1/TRPA1 channel, and an analysis and summary of the processes and mechanism by which natural herbs activate TRPV1/TRPA1 to enhance GI motility and relieve pain are provided, which will lay the foundation for the development of natural herb treatments for this disease.Copyright © 2023.

  Title: Neuromedin U programs eosinophils to promote mucosal immunity of the small intestine.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37708282
  Abstract: Eosinophils are granulocytes that play an essential role in type 2 immunity and regulate multiple homeostatic processes in the small intestine (SI). However, the signals that regulate eosinophil activity in the SI at steady state remain poorly understood. Through transcriptome profiling of eosinophils from various mouse tissues, we found that a subset of SI eosinophils expressed neuromedin U (NMU) receptor 1 (NMUR1). Fate-mapping analyses showed that NMUR1 expression in SI eosinophils was programmed by the local microenvironment and further enhanced by inflammation. Genetic perturbation and eosinophil-organoid coculture experiments revealed that NMU-mediated eosinophil activation promotes goblet cell differentiation. Thus, NMU regulates epithelial cell differentiation and barrier immunity by stimulating NMUR1-expressing eosinophils in the SI, which highlights the importance of neuroimmune-epithelial cross-talk in maintaining tissue homeostasis.

  Title: Conserved γδ T cell selection by BTNL proteins limits progression of human inflammatory bowel disease.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37708268
  Abstract: Murine intraepithelial γδ T cells include distinct tissue-protective cells selected by epithelial butyrophilin-like (BTNL) heteromers. To determine whether this biology is conserved in humans, we characterized the colonic γδ T cell compartment, identifying a diverse repertoire that includes a phenotypically distinct subset coexpressing T cell receptor Vγ4 and the epithelium-binding integrin CD103. This subset was disproportionately diminished and dysregulated in inflammatory bowel disease, whereas on-treatment CD103+γδ T cell restoration was associated with sustained inflammatory bowel disease remission. Moreover, CD103+Vγ4+cell dysregulation and loss were also displayed by humans with germline BTNL3/BTNL8 hypomorphism, which we identified as a risk factor for penetrating Crohn's disease (CD). Thus, BTNL-dependent selection and/or maintenance of distinct tissue-intrinsic γδ T cells appears to be an evolutionarily conserved axis limiting the progression of a complex, multifactorial, tissue-damaging disease of increasing global incidence.

  Title: [Inflammatory bowel disease].
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37707443
  Abstract: Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are increasing prevalent conditions with a high burden on both somatic and mental levels. The pharmacological treatment has significantly improved in recent decades with the introduction of multiple immune modulators and in the coming years, we expect to see the introduction of many new agents. The management of these diseases requires a multidisciplinary approach involving the involvement of surgeons, with timely discussion of surgery as a potential option in the treatment trajectory. Additionally, there is currently a strong emphasis on providing comprehensive care for individuals with IBD. Therefore, the management of IBD necessitates a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach.

  Title: Validation of the IBD-Control Questionnaire across different sociodemographic and clinical subgroups: Secondary analysis of a nationwide electronic survey.
  Keywords: Inflammatory Bowel Disease; Patient Reported Outcome Measures
  PMID: 37706542
  Abstract: The IBD-Control Questionnaire is a simple, generic measure of patient-perceived disease control used increasingly in clinical practice and research. We aimed to address knowledge gaps in its psychometric performance, to ensure that it can be used with confidence in a variety of contexts.We analysed 7,341 responses to the IBD Registry COVID-19 survey, sent to 40,911 patients who completed an online self-assessment tool during the pandemic. Questions covered demographics, comorbidities, IBD sub-type, IBD-Control Questionnaire and symptom scores (CD-PRO2 or UC-PRO2). Psychometric properties of IBD-Control-8 were tested overall and within subgroups (CD, UC and IBD-U; male and female; ≤65 and > 65 years; number of co-morbidities; deprivation status).Internal consistency was very strong overall (α: 0.84, ω: 0.89) and for each subgroup (α range: 0.81-0.85; ω: 0.86-0.90). Construct validity was demonstrated by moderate correlation of each item with global rating (VAS) (rs range: 0.47 to 0.65), strong correlation between IBD-Control-8 score and VAS (rs=0.74), moderate-to-strong with PRO2 scores (CD: rs = -0.718; UC: rs = -0.602) and significantly higher IBD-Control-8 scores for PRO2-remission versus -active, consistent across subgroups. Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analyses demonstrated a two-factor model (items loading onto 'Health-related Quality of Life' [HRQoL] or 'Treatment' domains). Extensive tests for factorial invariance confirmed consistency.IBD-Control-8 is a psychometrically robust scale which can be used across a range of populations. It offers a quick, reliable and valid method of assessing patient-perceived control. The construct of "control" includes traditional HRQoL and a novel domain relating to treatment perception.© The Author(s) 2023.

  Title: Sarcopenia and treatment failure in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37706492
  Abstract: The association between sarcopenia and treatment outcomes in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is currently a subject of controversy.A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for studies published until April 2023. The quality assessment of each included study was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.Seventeen studies were included with 2,895 IBD patients. Sarcopenia exhibited an increased risk of treatment failure (OR=2.00, 95% CI: 1.43-2.79) and notably increased the need for surgery (OR=1.54,95%CI:1.06-2.23) as opposed to pharmacologic treatment plan change (OR=1.19, 95% CI:0.71-2.01) among IBD patients. However, no significant association was found between sarcopenia and treatment failure in corticosteroid (OR=1.21, 95% CI: 0.55-2.64) or biologic agent (OR=1.65, 95% CI: 0.93-2.92) cohorts. Sarcopenia was also linked to elevated treatment failure risks in patients with Crohn's disease (OR=1.82, 95% CI: 1.15-2.90) and those diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (OR=2.55, 95% CI: 1.05-6.21), spanning both Asian (OR=1.88, 95% CI: 1.29-2.74) and Non-Asian regions (OR=2.17, 95% CI: 1.48-3.18).Sarcopenia was considered a novel marker to be used in clinical practice to predict treatment failure, in detail, the need for surgery in IBD patients. This distinct cohort necessitates clinical attention and tailored care strategies.

  Title: Immune-mediated colitis associated with ocrelizumab: A new safety risk.
  Keywords: Multiple sclerosis; colitis; ocrelizumab
  PMID: 37706451
  Abstract: An association between certain immunomodulatory therapies (rituximab, ipilimumab, and other immune checkpoint inhibitors) and inflammatory (non-ischemic and non-infectious) colitis in oncologic and non-oncologic patient populations is well documented in the medical literature.The purpose of this case series is to describe adverse event reports of new onset, inflammatory colitis in association with ocrelizumab in patients with multiple sclerosis submitted to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or published in the medical literature.The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and medical literature were searched.A review of postmarketing cases from FAERS and published medical literature identified 38 cases consistent with inflammatory, non-ischemic, and non-infectious colitis in association with ocrelizumab. The median time-to-onset was 8 months. Cases were reported using the following diagnostic terms: Crohn's disease (13), unspecified colitis (11), microscopic colitis (5), ulcerative colitis (5), medication-induced colitis (3), and autoimmune colitis (2).This case series highlights ocrelizumab induced immune-mediated colitis that can be clinically severe and potentially life-threatening. Based on the findings of this review, the ocrelizumab Prescribing Information was amended to include immune-mediated colitis in the Warnings and Precautions section.

  Title: Artificial intelligence in endoscopy: Overview, applications, and future directions.
  Keywords: Artificial intelligence; Barrett's; IBD; capsule endoscopy; endoscopy; polyp
  PMID: 37706421
  Abstract: Since the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine, endoscopy applications in gastroenterology have been at the forefront of innovations. The ever-increasing number of studies necessitates the need to organize and classify applications in a useful way. Separating AI capabilities by computer aided detection (CADe), diagnosis (CADx), and quality assessment (CADq) allows for a systematic evaluation of each application. CADe studies have shown promise in accurate detection of esophageal, gastric and colonic neoplasia as well as identifying sources of bleeding and Crohn's disease in the small bowel. While more advanced CADx applications employ optical biopsies to give further information to characterize neoplasia and grade inflammatory disease, diverse CADq applications ensure quality and increase the efficiency of procedures. Future applications show promise in advanced therapeutic modalities and integrated systems that provide multimodal capabilities. AI is set to revolutionize clinical decision making and performance of endoscopy.

  Title: Disease patterns among Saudi children undergoing colonoscopy for lower gastrointestinal bleeding: Single tertiary care center experience.
  Keywords: Children; Saudi Arabia; colonoscopy; rectal bleeding
  PMID: 37706419
  Abstract: : The yield of colonoscopy in cases presenting with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) in previously published studies varies according to several factors, including endoscopic skills, histopathological experience, and pattern of colonic pathology in different countries. The local literature is limited to a single small 20-year-old study. Our objective was to provide updated data on the diagnostic yield of colonoscopy in Saudi children with LGIB in Saudi Arabia.: This was a retrospective analysis of pediatric patients (0-14 years of age) who underwent colonoscopy for LGIB at the King Fahad Medical City (KFMC), from 2008 to 2018. LGIB was defined as fresh or dark blood per rectum.: During the study period, 175 children underwent colonoscopy for LGIB (99 males, mean age 7.05 ± 3.81 years), which constituted 53.5% of indications for colonoscopy procedures (n = 327) in our center. The terminal ileum was intubated in 81% of the procedures. Overall, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was the most commonly identified cause of LGIB (32% ) followed by colonic lymphonodular hyperplasia (CLNH) in 17% and juvenile polyp and rectal mucosal prolapse syndrome (RMPS), 11% each. On sub-analysis, cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) and CLNH were the most common causes in infants and toddlers, 35% each; IBD (26.5%) and polyps (22.4%) in young children (2-6 years), and IBD (36%), CLNH (14.9%) and RMPS (14%) in older children (6-14 years). In comparing the IBD to the non-IBD group, IBD patients were older (mean 8.37 vs. 6.46 years, P = 0.002) and more likely to have diarrhea, weight loss, high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anemia, and hypoalbuminemia (odds ratio 24, 11, 10.7, 6.5, and 4, respectively). Colonoscopy had a sensitivity of 97%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, negative predictive value of 81.4%, and accuracy of 97% in diagnosing LGIB.: Colonoscopy is an effective diagnostic tool in children with LGIB with a high diagnostic yield. Besides IBD, CLNH and RMPS are two other important pathologic entities that need to be considered in a child with LGIB.

  Title: Disease patterns among Saudi children undergoing colonoscopy for lower gastrointestinal bleeding: Single tertiary care center experience.
  Keywords: Children; Saudi Arabia; colonoscopy; rectal bleeding
  PMID: 37706419
  Abstract: : The yield of colonoscopy in cases presenting with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) in previously published studies varies according to several factors, including endoscopic skills, histopathological experience, and pattern of colonic pathology in different countries. The local literature is limited to a single small 20-year-old study. Our objective was to provide updated data on the diagnostic yield of colonoscopy in Saudi children with LGIB in Saudi Arabia.: This was a retrospective analysis of pediatric patients (0-14 years of age) who underwent colonoscopy for LGIB at the King Fahad Medical City (KFMC), from 2008 to 2018. LGIB was defined as fresh or dark blood per rectum.: During the study period, 175 children underwent colonoscopy for LGIB (99 males, mean age 7.05 ± 3.81 years), which constituted 53.5% of indications for colonoscopy procedures (n = 327) in our center. The terminal ileum was intubated in 81% of the procedures. Overall, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was the most commonly identified cause of LGIB (32% ) followed by colonic lymphonodular hyperplasia (CLNH) in 17% and juvenile polyp and rectal mucosal prolapse syndrome (RMPS), 11% each. On sub-analysis, cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) and CLNH were the most common causes in infants and toddlers, 35% each; IBD (26.5%) and polyps (22.4%) in young children (2-6 years), and IBD (36%), CLNH (14.9%) and RMPS (14%) in older children (6-14 years). In comparing the IBD to the non-IBD group, IBD patients were older (mean 8.37 vs. 6.46 years, P = 0.002) and more likely to have diarrhea, weight loss, high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anemia, and hypoalbuminemia (odds ratio 24, 11, 10.7, 6.5, and 4, respectively). Colonoscopy had a sensitivity of 97%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, negative predictive value of 81.4%, and accuracy of 97% in diagnosing LGIB.: Colonoscopy is an effective diagnostic tool in children with LGIB with a high diagnostic yield. Besides IBD, CLNH and RMPS are two other important pathologic entities that need to be considered in a child with LGIB.

  Title: Stitch-induced caecal fecolith: An unusual long-term complication following laparoscopic appendicectomy.
  Keywords: Abdominal pain; caecal fecolith; fecolith; post-appendicectomy recurrent pain; prolene stitch
  PMID: 37706403
  Abstract: A fecolith is a mass of accumulated hardened faecal matter usually seen in patients with Chagas disease, Hirschsprung's disease and inflammatory bowel disease. We report a 21-year-old female with chronic right lower abdominal pain post-appendicectomy. An abdominal computed tomography revealed a fecolith near the caecum and a right simple ovarian cyst. On diagnostic laparoscopy, a Prolene stitch in the previous appendicectomy site acting as a nidus and forming a fecolith was noted. It was excised by a small enterotomy and primary closure of the same. She had an uneventful post-operative course. This case highlights the danger of using a non-absorbable suture for appendicectomy and the rare phenomenon of fecolith formation post-appendicectomy after 4 years presenting with features of chronic recurrent abdominal pain.

  Title: A Rare Case of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis Overlapped With Autoimmune Hepatitis and Ulcerative Colitis.
  Keywords: autoimmune hepatitis; cholestasis; primary sclerosing cholangitis (psc); ulcerative colıtıs; ursodeoxycholic acid
  PMID: 37706140
  Abstract: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a liver disease of idiopathic origin, displaying a diverse and varied nature, which leads to cholestasis. It is characterized by continuous, advancing inflammation and fibrosis in the bile ducts. PSC is closely linked with inflammatory bowel disease and poses a risk for colon, bile duct, and gallbladder cancer. Unfortunately, there is currently no effective medical treatment available for this condition. In some cases, the disease may progress to end-stage liver failure, making liver transplantation a possible necessity for affected individuals. PSC association with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is very rare. This is a case of PSC that is overlapped with AIH. Screening colonoscopy showed colitis, and a biopsy was consistent with ulcerative colitis without any colitis symptoms, emphasizing the need for ruling out any other associated conditions, which respond well to the effective treatment to avoid morbidity and mortality in PSC.Copyright © 2023, Lakkasani et al.

  Title: The Arrival of Intestinal Ultrasound for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Care in the United States.
  Keywords: Crohn’s disease; Inflammatory bowel disease; disease activity; disease monitoring; intestinal ultrasound; ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37706105
  Abstract: Intestinal ultrasound (IUS) is a noninvasive and highly reliable point-of-care tool to evaluate inflammation of the bowel. It offers comparable accuracy to endoscopy and magnetic resonance enterography. Although IUS has been incorporated into the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in other parts of the world, it has only recently arrived in the United States. However, barriers to integration of IUS into IBD care in the United States have included a lack of adoption by leading centers, lack of educational opportunities, and an unclear path for remuneration. This article provides information about the use of IUS in IBD, reviews the data comparing existing modalities of assessment of IBD with IUS, and summarizes strategies to overcome existing barriers to IUS implementation, including the newly available US-based training pathway and appropriate billing practice.Copyright © 2023, Gastro-Hep Communications, Inc.

  Title: Discontinuation of infliximab treatment in patients with inflammatory bowel disease who retransitioned to originator and those who remained on biosimilar.
  Keywords: biosimilar; inflammatory bowel disease; infliximab
  PMID: 37706094
  Abstract: Many patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have transitioned from an infliximab originator to a biosimilar. However, some patients retransition to the originator (i.e. stop biosimilar and reinitiate the originator). Whether this sign of potential unsatisfactory treatment response is specifically related to the infliximab biosimilar or the patient and/or the disease including patients' beliefs on the biosimilar is unclear.We aimed to compare the risk of and reasons for infliximab discontinuation between retransitioned patients and those remaining on biosimilar.Non-interventional, multicentre cohort study.IBD patients who transitioned from infliximab originator to biosimilar between January 2015 and September 2019 in two Dutch hospitals were eligible for this study. Retransitioned patients (retransitioning cohort) were matched with patients remaining on biosimilar (biosimilar remainder cohort). Reasons for discontinuation were categorised as the unwanted response (i.e. loss of effect or adverse events) or remission. Risk of unwanted discontinuation was compared using Cox proportional hazards models.Patients in the retransitioning cohort (n = 44) were younger (median age 39.9 versus 44.0 years), more often female (65.9% versus 48.9%) and had shorter dosing intervals (median 48.5 versus 56.0 days) than in the biosimilar remainder cohort (n = 127). Infliximab discontinuation due to unwanted response was 22.7% in the retransitioning and 13.4% in the biosimilar remainder cohort, and due to remission was 2.3% and 9.4%, respectively. Retransitioned patients are at increased risk of discontinuing due to unwanted response compared with biosimilar remainder patients (adjusted HR 3.7, 95% CI: 1.0-13.9). Patients who retransitioned due to an increase in objective disease markers had higher discontinuation rates than patients who retransitioned due to symptoms only (66.7% versus 23.7%).Retransitioned patients are at increased risk of infliximab discontinuation due to unwanted response. Retransitioning appeared related to the patient and/or disease and not the product. Clinicians might switch patients opting for retransitioning to other treatment regimens.© The Author(s), 2023.

  Title: A Clinical Review of Mesenteric Panniculitis.
  Keywords: Mesenteric panniculitis; inflammation; mesentery; small bowel
  PMID: 37705847
  Abstract: Mesenteric panniculitis (MP) is a benign condition characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis of adipose tissue mainly of the small bowel mesentery. MP is commonly detected incidentally on cross-sectional imaging of the abdomen and can be asymptomatic in up to nearly half of patients. The most frequent clinical symptom reported is abdominal pain, followed by bloating/distention, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, fever, malaise, and nausea. On computed tomography, MP is seen as a mass-like area of increased fat attenuation within the small bowel mesentery, usually located in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. This mass-like area envelops mesenteric vessels and displaces adjacent bowel segments. Lymph nodes are frequently seen within the area of mesenteric abnormality. One of the most common differential diagnoses of MP is lymphoma, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography may be performed if there is suspicion of a concurrent underlying malignancy. Because of the benign nature of MP, treatment decisions should be guided by severity of symptoms and presence of complications. First-line medical treatment is prednisone and tamoxifen. Surgery is reserved for cases of recurrent bowel obstruction. This article provides a review of MP, including its epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, imaging findings, and treatment.Copyright © 2023, Gastro-Hep Communications, Inc.

  Title: Influence of Helicobacter pylori infection on risk of rheumatoid arthritis: a nationwide population-based study.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37704688
  Abstract: The relationship between Helicobacter pylori infection and rheumatoid arthritis has been investigated, but the results remain controversial. This study aims to determine the association between the two diseases via a 17-year retrospective cohort study. Using the National Health Insurance Research Database, a nationwide population based in Taiwan, we identified 97,533 individuals with H. pylori infection and matched controls between 2000 and 2017 using propensity score matching at a 1:1 ratio. The adjusted hazard ratio of rheumatoid arthritis was determined by multiple Cox regression. The incidence rate of rheumatoid arthritis was 1.28 per 10,000 person-months in the H. pylori cohort, with a higher risk compared to the control group. In the < 30 years old subgroup, the risk was highest, especially in women < 30 years old with H. pylori infection. Patients with < 1 year follow-up showed 1.58 times higher susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis. Individuals with follow-ups of 1-5 years and over 5 years demonstrated 1.43 and 1.44 times higher risks of rheumatoid arthritis, respectively. Our study showed H. pylori infection was associated with the development of rheumatoid arthritis. Clinicians should note higher risk, especially < 30 years old. More research needed to understand underlying mechanism.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited.

  Title: Shen-Ling-Bai-Zhu-San alleviates the imbalance of intestinal homeostasis in dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis mice by regulating gut microbiota and inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
  Keywords: Colitis; Gut microbiota; Intestinal homeostasis; NLRP3 inflammasome; Shen-Ling-Bai-Zhu-San
  PMID: 37704122
  Abstract: Shen-Ling-Bai-Zhu-San (SLBZS) is a classic formula for strengthening the spleen and dispelling dampness, which has shown excellent efficacy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in traditional Chinese medicine clinical studies. However, its exact pharmacological mechanism needs to be further elucidated.This study aims to investigate the restorative effect and mechanism of SLBZS on disturbed intestinal homeostasis in DSS-induced colitis mice.A colitis model was induced by 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for seven days, and SLBZS was administered by gavage. The influence of SLBZS on DSS-induced clinical symptoms and disease activity index (DAI) was monitored and analyzed. Alcian blue and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (FITC-WGA) staining were used to assess intestinal mucus changes. The expression of intestinal barrier function indexes and immune-associated indexes were determined by H&E staining, real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and Western blot. And gut microbiota changes were detected by 16 S rDNA sequencing technology. The antibiotic experiment was used to explore the role of gut microbiota in SLBZS treatment.The results showed that SLBZS significantly improved the physiological indexes including body weight, DAI score, and colon length of colitis mice. We focused on the effects of SLBZS on intestinal homeostasis in colitis mice. First, SLBZS could enhance the secretion of intestinal mucin and the expression levels of tight junctions and adhesive junctions. Second, SLBZS inhibited the expression level of inflammatory factors and reduced the protein expression level of NLRP3 inflammasome. Third, 16 S rDNA sequencing analysis revealed that SLBZS repaired the dysfunctional gut microbiota of colitis mice, such as enhancing the abundance of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria including Faecalibaculum, Colidextribacter, and Coprococcus. Further, by gut microbiota-depleted mice, we found that SLBZS could not exert an anti-colitis effect when gut microbiota was absent.SLBZS restored intestinal environmental homeostasis by enhancing intestinal barrier function, inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome, and restoring disturbed gut microbiota. And SLBZS could not ameliorate colitis mice with depleted gut microbiota. Our finding provided a theoretical basis for the clinical application of SLBZS in IBD.Copyright © 2023.

  Title: Research progress of natural plant polysaccharides inhibiting inflammatory signaling pathways and regulating intestinal flora and metabolism to protect inflammatory bowel disease.
  Keywords: Gut flora; Inflammatory bowel disease; Natural plant polysaccharides; Short chain fatty acids
  PMID: 37703965
  Abstract: Natural plant polysaccharides are macromolecular substances with a wide range of biological activities. They have a wide range of biological activities, especially play an important role in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. The molecular weight of polysaccharides, the composition of monosaccharides and the connection of glycosidic bonds will affect the therapeutic effect on inflammatory bowel disease. Traditional Chinese medicine plant polysaccharides and various types of plant polysaccharides reduce the levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-17, increase the level of anti-inflammatory factor IL-10, regulate NF-κB signaling pathway, and NLRP3 inflammasome to relieve colitis. At the same time, they can play a protective role by regulating the balance of intestinal flora in mice with colitis and increasing the abundance of probiotics to promote the metabolism of polysaccharide metabolites SCFAs. This review summarizes the research on the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease by many natural plant polysaccharides, and provides a theoretical basis for the later treatment of polysaccharides on inflammatory bowel disease.Copyright © 2023.

  Title: Inference of disease-associated microbial gene modules based on metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data.
  Keywords: Gene context conservation; Gene modules; Gene regulation; Metagenome and metatranscriptome; Unsupervised learning
  PMID: 37703713
  Abstract: The identification of microbial characteristics associated with diseases is crucial for disease diagnosis and therapy. However, the presence of heterogeneity, high dimensionality, and large amounts of microbial data presents tremendous challenges in discovering key microbial features. In this paper, we present IDAM, a novel computational method for inferring disease-associated gene modules from metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data. This method integrates gene context conservation (uber-operons) and regulatory mechanisms (gene co-expression patterns) within a mathematical graph model to explore gene modules associated with specific diseases. It alleviates reliance on prior meta-data. We applied IDAM to publicly available datasets from inflammatory bowel disease, melanoma, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and irritable bowel syndrome. The results demonstrated the superior performance of IDAM in inferring disease-associated characteristics compared to existing popular tools. Furthermore, we showcased the high reproducibility of the gene modules inferred by IDAM using independent cohorts with inflammatory bowel disease. We believe that IDAM can be a highly advantageous method for exploring disease-associated microbial characteristics.

  Title: Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: An Online Survey.
  Keywords: Crohn's disease; barriers to care; health disparities; social determinants of health; ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37703380
  Abstract: Data regarding care access and outcomes in Black/Indigenous/People of Color/Hispanic (BIPOC/H) individuals is limited. This study evaluated care barriers, disease status, and outcomes among a diverse population of White/non-Hispanic (W/NH) and BIPOC/H inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients at a large U.S. health system.An anonymous online survey was administered to adult IBD patients at Ochsner Health treated between Aug 2019 and Dec 2021. Collected data included symptoms, the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems and Barriers to Care surveys, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) via the Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, the Medication Adherence Rating Scale-4, and the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire. Medical record data examined healthcare resource utilization. Analyses compared W/NH and BIPOC/H via chi-square and t tests.Compared with their W/NH counterparts, BIPOC/H patients reported more difficulties accessing IBD specialists (26% vs 11%; P = .03), poor symptom control (35% vs 18%; P = .02), lower mean HRQOL (41 ± 14 vs 49 ± 13; P < .001), more negative impact on employment (50% vs 33%; P = .029), worse financial stability (53% vs 32%; P = .006), and more problems finding social/emotional support for IBD (64% vs 37%; P < .001). BIPOC/H patients utilized emergency department services more often (42% vs 22%; P = .004), reported higher concern scores related to IBD medication (17.1 vs 14.9; P = .001), and worried more about medication harm (19.5% vs 17.7%; P = .002). The survey response rate was 14%.BIPOC/H patients with IBD had worse clinical disease, lower HRQOL scores, had more medication concerns, had less access to specialists, had less social and emotional support, and used emergency department services more often than W/NH patients.© 2023 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

  Title: Steamed broccoli sprouts alleviate DSS-induced inflammation and retain gut microbial biogeography in mice.
  Keywords: Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron; biogeography; broccoli sprouts; dietary bioactives; glucoraphanin; gut microbiota; inflammatory bowel disease; sulforaphane; ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37702510
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are devastating conditions of the gastrointestinal tract with limited treatments, and dietary intervention may be effective and affordable for managing symptoms. Glucosinolate compounds are highly concentrated in broccoli sprouts, especially glucoraphanin (GLR), and can be metabolized by certain mammalian gut bacteria into anti-inflammatory isothiocyanates, such as sulforaphane. Gut microbiota exhibit biogeographic patterns, but it is unknown if colitis alters these or whether the location of glucoraphanin-metabolizing bacteria affects anti-inflammatory benefits. We fed specific pathogen-free C57BL/6 mice either a control diet or a 10% steamed broccoli sprout diet and gave a three-cycle regimen of 2.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water over a 34-day experiment to simulate chronic, relapsing ulcerative colitis (UC). We monitored body weight, fecal characteristics, lipocalin, serum cytokines, and bacterial communities from the luminal- and mucosal-associated populations in the jejunum, cecum, and colon. Mice fed the broccoli sprout diet with DSS treatment performed better than mice fed the control diet with DSS, and had significantly more weight gain, lower Disease Activity Index scores, lower plasma lipocalin and proinflammatory cytokines, and higher bacterial richness in all gut locations. Bacterial communities were assorted by gut location but were more homogenous across locations in the control diet + DSS mice. Importantly, our results showed that broccoli sprout feeding abrogated the effects of DSS on gut microbiota, as bacterial richness and biogeography were similar between mice receiving broccoli sprouts with and without DSS. Collectively, these results support the protective effect of steamed broccoli sprouts against dysbiosis and colitis induced by DSS. IMPORTANCE Evaluating bacterial communities across different locations in the gut provides a greater insight than fecal samples alone and provides an additional metric by which to evaluate beneficial host-microbe interactions. Here, we show that 10% steamed broccoli sprouts in the diet protects mice from the negative effects of dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis, that colitis erases biogeographic patterns of bacterial communities in the gut, and that the cecum is not likely to be a significant contributor to colonic bacteria of interest in the DSS mouse model of ulcerative colitis. Mice fed the broccoli sprout diet during colitis performed better than mice fed the control diet while receiving DSS. The identification of accessible dietary components and concentrations that help maintain and correct the gut microbiome may p

  Title: Oxidative stress, hormones, and effects of natural antioxidants on intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease.
  Keywords: Crohn’s disease; IBD; antioxidants; flavonoids; hormones; oxidative stress; polyphenols; ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37701897
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, relapsing gastrointestinal (GI) disorder characterized by intestinal inflammation. The etiology of IBD is multifactorial and results from a complex interplay between mucosal immunity, environmental factors, and host genetics. Future therapeutics for GI disorders, including IBD, that are driven by oxidative stress require a greater understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the GI tract, oxidative stressors include infections and pro-inflammatory responses, which boost ROS generation by promoting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) represent two important signaling pathways in intestinal immune cells that regulate numerous physiological processes, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Natural antioxidant compounds exhibit ROS scavenging and increase antioxidant defense capacity to inhibit pro-oxidative enzymes, which may be useful in IBD treatment. In this review, we discuss various polyphenolic substances (such as resveratrol, curcumin, quercetin, green tea flavonoids, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, luteolin, xanthohumol, genistein, alpinetin, proanthocyanidins, anthocyanins, silymarin), phenolic compounds including thymol, alkaloids such as berberine, storage polysaccharides such as tamarind xyloglucan, and other phytochemicals represented by isothiocyanate sulforaphane and food/spices (such as ginger, flaxseed oil), as well as antioxidant hormones like melatonin that target cellular signaling pathways to reduce intestinal inflammation occurring with IBD.Copyright © 2023 Sahoo, Heilmann, Paital, Patel, Yadav, Wong and Jergens.

  Title: IBD barriers across the continents: a continent-specific analysis - Australasia.
  Keywords: Australasia; inflammatory bowel disease; multidisciplinary care
  PMID: 37701793
  Abstract: Australasia, encompassing Australia, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea, has some of the highest prevalence's of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the world. The way IBD medicine is practiced varies between and within these countries. There are numerous shared issues of IBD care between Australia and New Zealand, whereas Papua New Guinea has its' own unique set of circumstances. This review looks to explore some of the barriers to IBD care across the continent from the perspective of local IBD healthcare professionals. Barriers to IBD care that are explored include access to IBD multidisciplinary teams, provision of nutritional-based therapies, the prevalence and engagement of IBD-associated mental health disorders, access to medicine, access to endoscopy, rural barriers to care, Indigenous IBD care and paediatric issues. We look to highlight areas where improvements to IBD care across Australasia could be made as well as address research needs.© The Author(s), 2023.

  Title: NOD-like receptors mediate homeostatic intestinal epithelial barrier function: promising therapeutic targets for inflammatory bowel disease.
  Keywords: IBD; NLRs; intestinal mucosal barrier; natural products; pathogenesis
  PMID: 37701792
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory disease that involves host genetics, the microbiome, and inflammatory responses. The current consensus is that the disruption of the intestinal mucosal barrier is the core pathogenesis of IBD, including intestinal microbial factors, abnormal immune responses, and impaired intestinal mucosal barrier. Cumulative data show that nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) are dominant mediators in maintaining the homeostasis of the intestinal mucosal barrier, which play critical roles in sensing the commensal microbiota, maintaining homeostasis, and regulating intestinal inflammation. Blocking NLRs inflammasome activation by botanicals may be a promising way to prevent IBD progression. In this review, we systematically introduce the multiple roles of NLRs in regulating intestinal mucosal barrier homeostasis and focus on summarizing the activities and potential mechanisms of natural products against IBD. Aiming to propose new directions on the pathogenesis and precise treatment of IBD.© The Author(s), 2023.

  Title: Clinical Application of a Peer Coaching Intervention to Enhance Self-Management for Adolescents and Young Adults With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Keywords: adolescents and young adults; case study; inflammatory bowel disease; peer support; topical review
  PMID: 37701558
  Abstract: The purpose of this article is to characterize the current evidence base related to peer support interventions for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to describe a peer support program to enhance self-management for AYAs with IBD through a case study. There is strong theory and compelling evidence suggesting that AYAs with IBD could benefit from and are interested in receiving peer support to enhance self-management; however, literature on peer support interventions for AYAs with IBD is lacking.This study (a) presents a topical review describing qualitative factors AYAs with IBD would seek in a peer support program as well as existing peer support programs for this population, (b) presents an innovative one-to-one peer support program targeting self-management through a case study, and (c) discusses clinical implications and directions for future research.Peer support offers a promising approach for AYAs with IBD that is feasible and acceptable to patient populations. However, results from the present topical review identified only two studies that examined peer support interventions for AYAs with IBD. The case study demonstrates how a theoretically driven program uses peer support to promote self-management and adaptive behavioral change.The paucity of literature in this area reveals a critical opportunity for future research and clinical programming to improve existing practices by leveraging peer support. We present the application of an innovative mobile-based peer coaching intervention that has the potential to support AYAs with IBD in their self-management.

  Title: The risk of COVID-19 in IBD patients is increased by urban living and is not influenced by disease activity or intravenous biologics.
  Keywords: Crohn’s disease; SARS-CoV-2; infliximab; trough levels; ulcerative colitis; vedolizumab
  PMID: 37701431
  Abstract: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may have a modified immune response to SARS-CoV-2. The objectives were to evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 in patients treated with infliximab or vedolizumab, to analyze the factors associated with the infection, the impact of treatments and trough levels.Patients with IBD treated with intravenous biologics in 14 French centers were included between March and June 2020 and followed-up for 6 months. Blood samples were collected for serologies and trough levels. The analysis of factors associated with COVID-19 was conducted in a matched 1:1 case-control sub-study with positive patients.In total, 1026 patients were included (74.9% infliximab). Over the follow-up period, 420 patients reported the occurrence of COVID-19 symptoms; 342 had been tested of whom 18 were positive. At the end of follow-up, 38 patients had a positive serology. Considering both nasal tests and serologies together, 46 patients (4.5%) had been infected. The risk of COVID-19 was related neither to the use of treatments (whatever the trough levels) nor to disease activity. Infections were more frequent when using public transport or living in flats in urban areas.The prevalence rate of COVID-19 in this IBD population treated with intravenous infliximab or vedolizumab was the same as the one in the French population before the start of the vaccination campaign. The risk was increased by urban living and was not influenced by disease activity or biologics. Sanitary barrier measures remain the best way to protect against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with IBD in biological therapy.Copyright © 2023 Lelong, Josien, Coste-Burel, Rimbert, Bressollette-Bodin, Nancey, Bouguen, Allez, Serrero, Caillo, Rouillon, Blanc, Laharie, Olivier, Peyrin-Biroulet, Dib, De Maissin, Montuclard, Trang-Poisson, Vavasseur, Gallot, Berthome, Braudeau, Chevreuil, Bourreille and Le Berre.

  Title: Drug-induced entero-colitis due to interleukin-17 inhibitor use; capsule endoscopic findings and pathological characteristics: A case report.
  Keywords: Capsule endoscopy; Case report; Drug-induced entero-colitis; Interleukin-17 inhibitor; Ixekizumab
  PMID: 37701132
  Abstract: Interleukin-17 (IL-17) inhibitors are known to cause exacerbation or new onset of inflammatory bowel disease upon administration. However, few reports have described characteristic endoscopic and histopathologic findings, and no small intestinal lesions have been reported so far.A woman in her 60s with psoriasis was administered ixekizumab (IXE), an anti-IL-17A antibody, for the treatment of psoriasis. Twenty months after commencing treatment, the patient visited our hospital because of persistent diarrhea. Blood tests performed at the time of the visit revealed severe inflammation, and colonoscopy revealed multiple round ulcers throughout the colon. A tissue biopsy of the ulcer revealed infiltration of inflammatory cells and granuloma-like findings in the submucosal layer. Capsule endoscopy revealed multiple jejunal erosions. After the withdrawal of IXE, the symptoms gradually improved, and ulcer reduction and scarring of the colon were endoscopically confirmed.To the best of our knowledge, 17 reports have documented IL-17 inhibitor-induced entero-colitis with endoscopic images, endoscopic findings, and pathological characteristics, including the present case. Nine of these cases showed diffuse loss of vascular pattern, coarse mucosa/ulcer formation in the left colon, and endoscopic findings similar to those of ulcerative colitis. In the remaining eight cases, discontinuous erosions and ulcerations from the terminal ileum to the rectum were seen, with endoscopic findings similar to those of Crohn's disease. In this case, the findings were confirmed by capsule endoscopy, which has not been previously reported.©The Author(s) 2023. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved.

  Title: Metastatic Crohn's Disease in External Genitalia With Good Outcome on Adalimumab: A Rare Case of a Saudi Female and a Short Review.
  Keywords: case report; crohn’s disease; cutaneous; granuloma; metastatic; non-caseating
  PMID: 37700991
  Abstract: Crohn's disease (CD), an inflammatory bowel disease that involves the gastrointestinal tract, is observed in daily hospital practice. On the other hand, metastatic Crohn's disease (MCD) is a rare entity in which cutaneous lesions are found in regions apart from the digestive system. This article describes a rare case of cutaneous CD in a Saudi female, which manifested initially as vulvar and perianal skin lesions. The diagnosis was proven by skin biopsy, and adalimumab offered effective treatment. Although cutaneous MCD is rare, it is an important cutaneous manifestation, as early detection creates the possibility of accessing effective management.Copyright © 2023, Alotaibi et al.

  Title: Regulation of type I IFN responses by deubiquitinating enzyme A in inflammatory bowel diseases.
  Keywords: DUBA; IBD; NOD2; TLR9; TRAF3; negative regulation; type I IFNs
  PMID: 37700847
  Abstract: The development of Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is driven by excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-12, and IL-23. This notion is supported by the remarkable clinical success of biologics targeting these cytokines. Recognition of cell wall components derived from intestinal bacteria by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) induces the production of these pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages and dendritic cells in human IBD and experimental colitis model. Although sensing of bacterial nucleic acids by endosomal TLRs, specifically TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 leads to robust production of type I IFNs, it remains debatable whether TLR-mediated type I IFN responses are pathogenic or protective in IBD patients. Additionally, recent studies identified deubiquitinating enzyme A (DUBA) as a novel negative regulator of TLR-mediated type I IFN responses. In light of these observations and their potential applications, in this review, we summarize recent findings on the roles of type I IFN responses and DUBA-mediated negative regulation of these responses in human IBD and experimental colitis model.Copyright © 2023 JCBN.

  Title: A case of neonatal sweet syndrome associated with mevalonate kinase deficiency.
  Keywords: Mevalonate kinase deficiency; Mevalonate kinase-associated diseases; Sweet syndrome; Very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease
  PMID: 37700301
  Abstract: Sweet syndrome (SS), also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is an immunologic syndrome characterized by widespread neutrophilic infiltration. Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome (H-SS) is a histopathologic variant of SS. While SS most commonly occurs in adults, this case report discusses an infant patient who presented with H-SS.Through a multidisciplinary approach, this patient was also found to have very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) and Mevalonate kinase-associated disease (MKAD). While prior case studies have characterized an association between VEO-IBD and MKAD, there is no literature describing the association of all three diagnoses this case: H-SS, VEO-IBD and MKAD. Initiation of canakinumab in this patient resulted in successful control of the disease.This case highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to rare diagnoses, and collaboration during cases with significant diagnostic uncertainty.© 2023.

  Title: Vedolizumab-induced acute interstitial nephritis with failure of steroid prophylaxis on vedolizumab rechallenge.
  Keywords: Acute renal failure; Inflammatory bowel disease; Unwanted effects / adverse reactions
  PMID: 37699736
  Abstract: Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is a common cause of acute kidney injury and renal failure. It is typically drug induced but can also be idiopathic or secondary to chronic infective or inflammatory conditions. Recent case reports suggest vedolizumab can be a causative agent for AIN. We report the case of a young man who presented with renal failure, fevers and constitutional symptoms. He had a complex history of refractory ulcerative colitis, prior colectomy and ileo-pouch-anal anastomosis with recurrent pouchitis. He had been receiving regular vedolizumab infusions for 6 months by the time of his presentation. A renal biopsy 4 months into his follow-up demonstrated AIN. Steroid prophylaxis with vedolizumab was trialled but ultimately failed, with worsening AIN and incomplete renal function recovery. To our knowledge, this is the first case of vedolizumab-induced AIN demonstrating a failure of steroid prophylaxis to prevent recurrence of AIN following vedolizumab rechallenge.© BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2023.

  Title: Long-term effectiveness and safety of infliximab-biosimilar: A multicenter Phoenix retrospective cohort study.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37699041
  Abstract: Infliximab (IFX) effectively treats patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IFX-biosimilar (IFX-BS) has the same amino acid sequence as that of the IFX originator, and its increasing use is expected to reduce national healthcare costs. Long-term efficacy and safety of IFX-BS in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) have not been completely investigated.We conducted a retrospective, multicenter observational study of patients with IBD who received IFX-BS treatment at three hospitals between October 2016 and April 2022. Clinical data were collected from electronic medical records and evaluated for achieving clinical remission (CR) using Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) and partial Mayo (pMayo) score, persistency of long-term IFX-BS administration, and clinical response rate in the bio-naïve and bio-failure groups.A total of 117 patients with IBD (90 CD and 27 UC) were included. The study findings indicated that both bio-naïve and bio-failure groups of patients with UC showed similar effectiveness of IFX-BS. The treatment persistence rate in patients with CD was significantly higher in the bio-naïve (P = 0.042) and switch (P = 0.010) groups than in the bio-failure group. In the former two groups, the treatment persistence rate was high at two years after administration (more than 80%). In patients with UC, the findings indicated higher treatment persistence rate in the switch group than in the bio-naïve group. Univariable and multivariable analyses for treatment persistence rate showed that the albumin level at the initial IFX-BS administration and groups (bio-naïve, bio-failure and switch) were effective factors for patients with CD. Adverse events were reported in 18 patients (15.4%).The present study demonstrates the long-term effectiveness and safety of IFX-BS. In addition to the favorable remission induction in the bio-naïve and bio-failure groups, we demonstrated remission maintenance and treatment persistence rates beyond two years. Albumin level and groups were associated with better treatment persistence in patients with CD.Copyright: © 2023 Kazama et al.

  Title: Ingestible pH sensing device for gastrointestinal health monitoring based on thread-based electrochemical sensors.
  Keywords: Gastrointestinal monitoring; Ingestible devices; Smart pill; Smart sutures; Smart threads; pH sensor
  PMID: 37698743
  Abstract: There exists a strong correlation between the pH levels of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and GI diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBS), ulcerative colitis, and pancreatis. Existing methods for diagnosing many GI diseases predominantly rely on invasive, expensive, and time-consuming techniques such as colonoscopy and endoscopy. In this study, an autonomous ingestible smart biosensing system in a pill format with integrated pH sensors is reported. The smart sensing pills will measure the pH profile as they transit through the GI tract. The data is then downloaded from the pills after they are collected from the feces. The sensor is based on electrodeposited PANI on carbon-coated conductive threads providing high pH sensitivity. Engineering innovations allowed integration of thread-based sensors on 3D-printed pill surfaces with front-end readout electronics, memory, and microcontroller assembled on mm-size circular printed circuit boards. The entire smart sensing pill possesses an overall length of 22.1 mm and an outer diameter of 9 mm. The modular biosensing system allows integration of thread-based biosensors to monitor other biomarkers in GI tract that mitigates the complex sensor fabrication process as well as overall pill assembly.© 2023.

  Title: Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 at a glance.
  Keywords: Cellular processes; Function; GTPase; Kinase; Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2; Parkinson's disease; Structure

  Abstract: Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a multidomain scaffolding protein with dual guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) and kinase enzymatic activities, providing this protein with the capacity to regulate a multitude of signalling pathways and act as a key mediator of diverse cellular processes. Much of the interest in LRRK2 derives from mutations in the LRRK2 gene being the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease, and from the association of the LRRK2 locus with a number of other human diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore, the LRRK2 research field has focused on the link between LRRK2 and pathology, with the aim of uncovering the underlying mechanisms and, ultimately, finding novel therapies and treatments to combat them. From the biochemical and cellular functions of LRRK2, to its relevance to distinct disease mechanisms, this Cell Science at a Glance article and the accompanying poster deliver a snapshot of our current understanding of LRRK2 function, dysfunction and links to disease.© 2023.

  Title: Unlocking the potential of targeting histone-modifying enzymes for treating IBD and CRC.
  Keywords: CRC; Gut microbiota; Histone modification; Histone-modifying enzyme; IBD
  PMID: 37697409
  Abstract: Dysregulation of histone modifications has been implicated in the pathogenesis of both inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). These diseases are characterized by chronic inflammation, and alterations in histone modifications have been linked to their development and progression. Furthermore, the gut microbiota plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses and maintaining gut homeostasis, and it has been shown to exert effects on histone modifications and gene expression in host cells. Recent advances in our understanding of the roles of histone-modifying enzymes and their associated chromatin modifications in IBD and CRC have provided new insights into potential therapeutic interventions. In particular, inhibitors of histone-modifying enzymes have been explored in clinical trials as a possible therapeutic approach for these diseases. This review aims to explore these potential therapeutic interventions and analyze previous and ongoing clinical trials that examined the use of histone-modifying enzyme inhibitors for the treatment of IBD and CRC. This paper will contribute to the current body of knowledge by exploring the latest advances in the field and discussing the limitations of existing approaches. By providing a comprehensive analysis of the potential benefits of targeting histone-modifying enzymes for the treatment of IBD and CRC, this review will help to inform future research in this area and highlight the significance of understanding the functions of histone-modifying enzymes and their associated chromatin modifications in gastrointestinal disorders for the development of potential therapeutic interventions.© 2023.

  Title: Bidirectional association between infectious gastroenteritis and inflammatory bowel disease: a population-based study.
  Keywords: Bidirectional association; Crohn’s disease; Epidemiology; Infectious gastroenteritis; Inflammatory bowel disease; Ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37697336
  Abstract: Intertwined association between infectious gastroenteritis (IGE) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has not been investigated clearly. We aimed to examine the bidirectional association between IGE and IBD.A bidirectional study using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database was designed. Through a case-control design, we identified 2899 new IBD cases during 2006-2017 and matched to 28,990 non-IBD controls. We used conditional logistic regression model to estimate odds ratios (OR) of IBD for previous IGE in different exposure time-windows within 5-years before IBD diagnosis and Poisson regression model to estimate incidence rate ratio (IRR) of subsequent IGE for IBD group to non-IBD group.The mean age at the initial IBD diagnosis was 41 years. More IBD patients (21.49%) than controls (12.60%) had been exposed to IGE during > 6 months to 5 years before IBD diagnosis, the OR of IBD for IGE was 1.89 [95% confidence interval: 1.69-2.11]. Excess OR decreased as IGE exposure time before the index date increased. More IGE episodes were associated with additional increase in IBD risk (OR: 1.64, 2.19, 2.57, 3.50, and 4.57 in patients with 1, 2, 3, 4, and ≥ 5 IGE episodes, respectively). The IRR of having IGE for IBD group to non-IBD group was 2.42 before IBD diagnosis and increased to 5.74 after IBD diagnosis.These findings suggested an IGE-IBD bidirectional association. More attention is needed for physicians to develop preventive strategies and be aware of the higher risk of subsequent IGE in IBD patients.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

  Title: Expression of Circulating let-7e and miR-126 May Predict Clinical Remission in Patients With Crohn's Disease Treated With Anti-TNF-α Biologics.
  Keywords: Crohn’s disease; adalimumab; biomarkers; infliximab; miRNAs
  PMID: 37696681
  Abstract: The identification of new biomarkers predictive of response to antitumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF-α) monoclonal antibodies remains an unmet medical need in Crohn's disease (CD) because a high percentage of patients show no clinical improvement after treatment or can lose response over time. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can regulate inflammatory and immunological responses and were found to play a role in CD.Baseline serum samples from 37 CD patients previously treated with infliximab or adalimumab, as per clinical practice, were obtained from the serum library at the Gastroenterology Unit of the University Hospital of Pisa, Italy. Patients were categorized as responders or nonresponders based on the following treatment outcomes: clinical remission at weeks 14 and 54 and endoscopic remission at week 54. The expression levels of a panel of selected miRNAs were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Comparisons of miRNA expression between responders and nonresponders and statistical analyses were performed by MedCalc and GraphPad Prism software. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were calculated to evaluate the predictive performance of potential biomarkers.Patients in clinical remission at week 14 had a lower let-7e expression, whereas those in clinical remission at week 54 had lower levels of circulating miR-126 than nonresponders. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified optimal cutoff values with assay sensitivity and specificity of 92.9% and 61.1%, for let-7e, and 62.5% and 83.3%, for miR-126, respectively.These results provide evidence that expression levels of circulating let-7e and miR-126 at baseline may predict clinical remission in CD patients treated with anti-TNF-α biologics.© The Author(s) 2023.

  Title: Characterization of the Gut Microbiota and Mycobiota in Italian Pediatric Patients With Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis and Ulcerative Colitis.
  Keywords: dysbiosis; gut microbiota; gut mycobiota; primary sclerosing cholangitis; ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37696680
  Abstract: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic, fibroinflammatory, cholestatic liver disease of unknown etiopathogenesis, often associated with inflammatory bowel diseases. Recent evidence ascribes, together with immunologic and environmental components, a significant role to the intestinal microbiota or its molecules in the PSC pathogenesis.By metagenomic sequencing of 16S rRNA and ITS2 loci, we describe the fecal microbiota and mycobiota of 26 pediatric patients affected by PSC and concomitant ulcerative colitis (PSC-UC), 27 patients without PSC but with UC (UC), and 26 healthy subjects (CTRLs).Compared with CTRL, the bacterial and fungal gut dysbiosis was evident for both PSC-UC and UC groups; in particular, Streptococcus, Saccharomyces, Sporobolomyces, Tilletiopsis, and Debaryomyces appeared increased in PSC-UC, whereas Klebsiella, Haemophilus, Enterococcus Collinsella, Piptoporus, Candida, and Hyphodontia in UC. In both patient groups, Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Oscillospira, Meyerozyma and Malassezia were decreased. Co-occurrence analysis evidenced the lowest number of nodes and edges for fungi networks compared with bacteria. Finally, we identified a specific patient profile, based on liver function tests, bacterial and fungal signatures, that is able to distinguish PSC-UC from UC patients.We describe the gut microbiota and mycobiota dysbiosis associated to PSC-UC disease. Our results evidenced a gut imbalance, with the reduction of gut commensal microorganisms with stated anti-inflammatory properties (ie, Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Oscillospira, Meyerozyma, and Malassezia) and the increase of pathobionts (ie, Streptococcus, Saccharomyces, and Debaryomyces) that could be involved in PSC progression. Altogether, these events may concur in the pathophysiology of PSC in the framework of UC.© 2023 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

  Title: How Can Pharmacists Better Support Patients with Chronic Diseases? The Patient Perspective.
  Keywords: cardiovascular disease; chronic disease; communication; inflammatory bowel disease; patient perception; pharmacist
  PMID: 37696490
  Abstract: Patients' perceptions of their interaction with pharmacists can affect how they use this resource for chronic disease care.This qualitative study explored pharmacist-patient interactions and patients' perceptions of pharmacists' roles in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Patient volunteers, recruited through Janssen's Patient Engagement Research Council program, completed a 15-minute prework survey before a 90-minute live virtual focus group session to provide feedback on pharmacist-patient interactions, the pharmacist's role in patient care, and recommendations for improvement.In total, 27 patients participated. Amongst patients with CVD (n=18), 56% were female, 61% aged ≥65 years, and 39%/39% Black/White. Of those with IBD (n=9), 56% were female, 89% aged 25-44 years, and 33%/56% Black/White. In the CVD cohort, patients conversed with their pharmacists at least monthly, on average. Patients were generally happy with their relationship with their pharmacist, viewing pharmacists as a trusted resource for medication information. Polypharmacy was common in the CVD cohort (mean, 10.8 medications). For patients with IBD, pharmacist-patient interactions were less frequent, relationships were generally perceived as transactional, patients took fewer medications (mean, 3.2), and felt uncomfortable discussing their disease in public. All patients (CVD and IBD) were unaware of pharmacists' medical training/knowledge. Recommendations included private spaces for sensitive conversations, phone/text support, in-depth regular check-ins, and proactive communication to highlight that the pharmacist's role is to provide patient-centered holistic care.This research demonstrates a lack of understanding of pharmacist training, accessibility, and role among patients with chronic disease, and highlights opportunities to amend delivery of care. These insights can be used to inform strategies and approaches tailored to address unique needs of specific patient populations to enhance pharmacist-patient interactions.Copyright © 2023.

  Title: Impact of sarcopenia on outcomes in surgical patients:A systematic review and meta-analysis.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37696253
  Abstract: Surgeons have historically used age as a preoperative predictor of postoperative outcomes. Sarcopenia, the loss of skeletal muscle mass due to disease or biological age, has been proposed as a more accurate risk predictor. The prognostic value of sarcopenia assessment in surgical patients remains poorly understood. Therefore, we aimed to synthesize the available literature and investigate the impact of sarcopenia on peri- and postoperative outcomes across all surgical specialties.We systematically assessed the prognostic value of sarcopenia on postoperative outcomes by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, searching the PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from inception to 1st October 2022. Our primary outcomes were complication occurrence, mortality, length of operation and hospital stay, discharge to home, and postdischarge survival rate at one, three, and five years. Subgroup analysis was performed by stratifying complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification system. Sensitivity analysis was performed by focusing on studies with an oncological, cardiovascular, emergency, or transplant surgery population, and on those of higher quality or prospective study design.A total of 294 studies comprising 97,643 patients, of which 33,070 had sarcopenia, were included in our analysis. Sarcopenia was associated with significantly poorer postoperative outcomes including greater mortality, complication occurrence, length of hospital stay, and lower rates of discharge to home (all P<0.00001). A significantly lower survival rate in patients with sarcopenia was noted at one, three, and five years (all P<0.00001) after surgery. Subgroup analysis confirmed higher rates of complications and mortality in oncological (both P<0.00001), cardiovascular (both P<0.00001), and emergency (P=0.03 and P=0.04, respectively) patients with sarcopenia. In the transplant surgery cohort, mortality was significantly higher in patients with sarcopenia (P<0.00001). Among all patients undergoing surgery for inflammatory bowel disease, the frequency of complications was significantly increased among sarcopenic patients (P=0.007). Sensitivity analysis based on higher-quality studies and prospective studies showed that sarcopenia remained a significant predictor of mortality and complication occurrence (all P<0.00001).Sarcopenia is a significant predictor of poorer outcomes in surgical patients. Preoperative assessment of sarcopenia can help surgeons to identify patients at risk, critically balance eligibility, and refine perioperative management. Large-scale studies are required to further validate the importance of sarcopenia as a prognostic indicator of perioperative risk, especially in surgical sub-specialties.Copyright © 2023

  Title: Thymopentin ameliorates experimental colitis via inhibiting neutrophil extracellular traps.
  Keywords: Colitis; Crohn's disease; Neoseptin 3; Neutrophil extracellular traps; Thymopentin
  PMID: 37696141
  Abstract: The long-term prognosis of Crohn's disease (CD) remains unsatisfactory. Therefore, we assessed the therapeutic effect of thymopentin (TP5) in a mouse model of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis, which mimics CD, and analyzed its impact on neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs).NET markers, including myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (NE), citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3), peptidyl arginine deiminase IV (PAD4), and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) were assessed by immunostaining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. NET formation was evaluated in vitro. Neoseptin 3, a specific NET agonist, was used to reverse the effect of TP5 on TNBS-induced colitis. The action mechanism of TP5 was investigated using RNA-seq.TP5 ameliorated weight loss (P < 0.001), disease activity index (DAI) (P = 0.05), colon shrinkage (P = 0.04), and elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and neutrophils in the TNBS group. The TNBS group exhibited increased MPO, NE, CitH3, PAD4, dsDNA and MPO-DNA levels (all P < 0.001), which decreased after TP5 administration (P = 0.01, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P = 0.02, and P = 0.02 respectively). Tissue CitH3 levels were positively correlated with DAI and TNF-α levels (P < 0.05). Furthermore, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated NET formation increased by 1.8-, 2.8-, and 2.3-fold in vitro in the control, TNBS + saline, and TNBS + TP5 groups, respectively. Neoseptin 3 significantly reversed the effect of TP5. RNA-seq revealed potential pathways underlying the effect of TP5.TP5 effectively ameliorated colitis by suppressing NETs in the experimental CD model.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

  Title: Precision Dosing of Anti-TNF Therapy in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Keywords: Adalimumab; Children; Crohn’s disease; Infliximab; Model-informed dosing; Ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37695555
  Abstract: This review focuses on recent advancements in anti-TNF therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), pharmacogenetics and personalized drug selection for children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Several real-world studies and one clinical trial in children have demonstrated that proactive TDM, targeting higher exposure concentrations (> 5 µg/mL), can improve disease remission rates and enhance durability of the anti-TNF biologics. Recent data from both adult and pediatric IBD patients have revealed an association between a genetic polymorphism (HLA-DQA1*05) and the development of auto-drug antibodies. The impact of this association on clinical outcomes, considering more routine use proactive TDM and dose optimization in children, is still under investigation. Additionally, recent studies have identified potential inflammatory signatures and biomarkers that may serve as companion diagnostics for anti-TNF biologics. The effective management of anti-TNF therapies in children with IBD requires evidence-based precision dosing strategies, including routine TDM and proactive pharmacodynamic assessments.© 2023.

  Title: Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Like Symptoms in Quiescent Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Practical Approach to Diagnosis and Treatment of Organic Causes.
  Keywords: Crohn’s disease; Inflammatory bowel disease; Irritable bowel syndrome; Ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37695549
  Abstract: Despite achieving remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), persistent gastrointestinal symptoms are common in quiescent IBD. While irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is commonly diagnosed in IBD, IBS-like symptoms of recurrent abdominal pain and altered bowel habits can also be attributed to a wide range of overlapping gastrointestinal (GI) etiologies and systemic disorders with GI manifestations that often do not respond to conventional IBS therapies. Delay in diagnosis of these conditions can lead to ongoing patient suffering, reduced quality of life, repetition of invasive testing, increased healthcare utilization, and potentially unnecessary empirical escalation of IBD-related treatments.This review provides a practical approach for the evaluation and diagnosis of IBS mimickers in IBD. We summarize the definition, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of the potential etiologies causing unexplained GI symptoms.Overlapping conditions can co-exist with IBD and explain IBS-like symptoms. The diagnostic work-up in this population should be individualized and tailored to the predominant symptom pattern, associated clinical signs and symptoms and predisposing conditions that can be obtained from a detailed history and physical examination.© 2023.

  Title: Effect of chronic low-dose treatment with chitooligosaccharides on microbial dysbiosis and inflammation associated chronic ulcerative colitis in Balb/c mice.
  Keywords: BALB/c mice; Chitooligosaccharides; DSS colitis; Gut microbiota; Inflammation; Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
  PMID: 37695333
  Abstract: The study aimed to investigate the potential of low dose chitooligosaccharide (COS) in ameliorating dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) induced chronic colitis by regulating microbial dysbiosis and pro-inflammatory responses. Chronic colitis was induced in BALB/c mice by DSS (4% w/v, 3 cycles of 5 days) administration. The mice were divided into four groups: vehicle, DSS, DSS + mesalamine and DSS+COS. COS and mesalamine were administered orally, daily once, from day 1 to day 30 at a dose of 20 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg respectively. The disease activity index (DAI), colon length, histopathological score, microbial composition, and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression were evaluated. COS (20 mg/kg, COSLow) administration reduced the disease activity index, and colon shortening, caused by DSS significantly. Furthermore, COSLow restored the altered microbiome in the gut and inhibited the elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 and IL-6) in the colon against DSS-induced chronic colitis in mice. Moreover, COSLow treatment improved the probiotic microflora thereby restoring the gut homeostasis. In conclusion, this is the first study where microbial dysbiosis and pro-inflammatory responses were modulated by chronic COSLow treatment against DSS-induced chronic colitis in Balb/c mice. Therefore, COS supplementation at a relatively low dose could be efficacious for chronic inflammatory bowel disease.© 2023. The Author(s).

  Title: Fecal Calprotectin in Predicting Relapse of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Children and Adolescents: A Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37695282
  Abstract: The application of fecal calprotectin in the relapse of inflammatory bowel disease remains uncertain in children and adolescents. We systematically searched the common databases for eligible studies. Judgment of diagnostic accuracy included pooled sensitivity and specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and pooled area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Ultimately, a total of 414 participants from six studies were included. The combined sensitivity, specificity, PLR, and NLR with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 0.85 (95% CI = 0.65 to 0.79), 0.71 (95% CI = 0.52 to 0.85), 2.95 (95% CI = 1.71 to 5.09), and 0.21 (95% CI = 0.08 to 0.51), respectively. The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.85, and the DOR was 14.14 (95% CI = 4.46 to 44.80). Our study showed that fecal calprotectin as a biomarker to predict the clinical relapse of inflammatory bowel disease during remission in children and adolescents is effective and worth applying.

  Title: Prevalence of hepatobiliary manifestations in inflammatory bowel disease: a GRADE assessed systematic review and meta-analysis on more than 1.7 million patients.
  Keywords: Chronic Liver Disease; Hepatobiliary Disorders; Inflammatory Bowel Disease
  PMID: 37695111
  Abstract: Background: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an immune-mediated group of chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. Patients with IBD may experience extraintestinal manifestations, such as the hepatobiliary complications. This meta-analysis aims to assess the prevalence of different hepatic manifestations in IBD patients.For this systematic review and meta-analysis, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase were searched until July 20, 2022, by specifying keywords for IBD, hepatic manifestations, and study type. Full texts of cohort studies in English that examined the prevalence of different hepatic manifestations were included in this study. The primary outcome was the overall prevalence of hepatic manifestations in IBD patients. For the statistical analysis, a proportion by random effect model meta-analysis was performed. The registration number for the protocol of this study in PROSPERO is CRD42022369595.From the 4,421 articles retrieved from the primary search, 118 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. After a pooled analysis of 1,729,128 patients, the overall prevalence of hepatic manifestations was 3.49% (95% CI: 3.31%-3.68%; I  2: 99.55%). The pooled prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in 228,216 patients was 26.1% (95% CI: 22.1-30.2%; I  2: 99.018%). After pooled analysis of 9,642 patients, the prevalence of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) was 1.67% (95% CI: 1.47-1.88%; I  2: 99.10%). The pooled prevalence of biliary stones was considered to be 4.1% (95% CI: 3.6-4.7%; I  2: 97.43%). Autoimmune hepatitis [0.51% (95% CI: 0.26-0.75%; I  2: 85.36%)] and portal vein thrombosis (PVT) [0.21% (95% CI: 0.08-0.33%; I  2: 97.95%] are considered as rare manifestations.This study summarizes the prevalence and importance of different hepatic manifestations in IBD patients. These findings are crucial for the management of EIMs, especially hepatic manifestations, in IBD patients.© The Author(s) 2023.

  Title: The role of intestine in metabolic dysregulation in murine Wilson disease.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37695076
  Abstract: The clinical manifestations of Wilson disease (WD) are related to copper accumulation in the liver and the brain, but little is known about other tissue involvement regarding metabolic changes in WD. In vitro studies suggested that the loss of intestinal ATP7B affects metabolic dysregulation in WD. We tested this hypothesis by evaluating the gut microbiota and lipidome in 2 mouse models of WD and by characterizing a new mouse model with a targeted deletion of Atp7b in the intestine.Cecal content 16S sequencing and untargeted hepatic and plasma lipidome analyses in the Jackson Laboratory toxic-milk and the Atp7b null global knockout mouse models of WD were profiled and integrated. Intestine-specific Atp7b knockout mice (Atp7bΔIEC) were generated and characterized using targeted lipidome analysis following a high-fat diet challenge.Gut microbiota diversity was reduced in animal models of WD. Comparative prediction analysis revealed amino acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism functions to be dysregulated in the WD gut microbial metagenome. Liver and plasma lipidomic profiles showed dysregulated triglyceride and diglyceride, phospholipid, and sphingolipid metabolism in WD models. However, Atp7bΔIEC mice did not show gut microbiome differences compared to wild type. When challenged with a high-fat diet, Atp7bΔIEC mice exhibited profound alterations to fatty acid desaturation and sphingolipid metabolism pathways as well as altered APOB48 distribution in intestinal epithelial cells.Gut microbiome and lipidome underlie systemic metabolic manifestations in murine WD. Intestine-specific ATP7B deficiency affected both intestinal and systemic response to a high-fat challenge but not the microbiome profile, at least at early stages. WD is a systemic disease in which intestinal-specific ATP7B loss and diet influence the phenotype and the lipidome profile.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

  Title: Sterile triggers drive joint inflammation in TNF- and IL-1β-dependent mouse arthritis models.
  Keywords: arthritis; germ-free; gut-joint axis; intestinal inflammation; microbiome
  PMID: 37694693
  Abstract: Arthritis is the most common extra-intestinal complication in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Conversely, arthritis patients are at risk for developing IBD and often display subclinical gut inflammation. These observations suggest a shared disease etiology, commonly termed "the gut-joint-axis." The clinical association between gut and joint inflammation is further supported by the success of common therapeutic strategies and microbiota dysbiosis in both conditions. Most data, however, support a correlative relationship between gut and joint inflammation, while causative evidence is lacking. Using two independent transgenic mouse arthritis models, either TNF- or IL-1β dependent, we demonstrate that arthritis develops independently of the microbiota and intestinal inflammation, since both lines develop full-blown articular inflammation under germ-free conditions. In contrast, TNF-driven gut inflammation is fully rescued in germ-free conditions, indicating that the microbiota is driving TNF-induced gut inflammation. Together, our study demonstrates that although common inflammatory pathways may drive both gut and joint inflammation, the molecular triggers initiating such pathways are distinct in these tissues.© 2023 The Authors.

  Title: Role of epigenetic modifications mediated by vitamins and trace elements in inflammatory bowel disease.
  Keywords: IBD; epigenetic modifications; inflammatory bowel disease; trace elements; vitamins
  PMID: 37694343
  Abstract: Graphical abstract [Formula: see text] Numerous environmental factors frequently emerge as primary determinants of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Diet is a major component of environmental factors, and the consumption of vitamins (A, B, C and D) and trace elements (calcium, iron, zinc and selenium) exerts an impact on the progression of IBD through epigenetic modifications. Intake of vitamins A, B, C and D, as well as excessive amounts of iron and calcium, can modulate the condition of IBD by regulating the levels of DNA methylation, histone acetylation and miRNA. Zinc and selenium alleviate the progression of IBD by regulating the levels of promoter methylation or histone ubiquitination, respectively.

  Title: Luteolin alleviates ulcerative colitis in rats via regulating immune response, oxidative stress, and metabolic profiling.
  Keywords: immune response; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; luteolin; metabolomics; oxidative stress; ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37693835
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease and associated with metabolic imbalance. Luteolin (LUT) reportedly exhibits anti-inflammatory activity. However, its regulatory effects on metabolites remain indistinct. Here, the effects of LUT on immune response and oxidative stress in UC were determined. Serum metabolomics profiles of UC rats treated with LUT were obtained utilizing liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results revealed that LUT treatment alleviated colon tissue injury, colon shortening, weight loss, and inflammatory response in UC rats. Additionally, the levels of superoxide dismutase and total antioxidant capacity were elevated, but malondialdehyde content was reduced in serum of UC rats, while these changes were abrogated by LUT. Metabolomics analysis unveiled that l-malic acid, creatinine, l-glutamine, and l-lactic acid levels were remarkably decreased, while dimethyl sulfone, 5-methylcytosine, cysteine-S-sulfate, and jasmonic acid levels were notably increased after LUT treatment. Furthermore, differential metabolites primarily participated in d-glutamine and d-glutamate metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and citrate cycle pathways. In summary, these results demonstrated that LUT improved immune response, alleviated oxidative stress, and altered metabolites in UC rats. This study lays the root for further exploring the mechanism of LUT in the treatment of UC.© 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.

  Title: The causal relationship between autoimmune diseases and osteoporosis: a study based on Mendelian randomization.
  Keywords: bone mineral density; fall risk; fracture risk; osteoporosis; two-sample Mendelian randomization
  PMID: 37693362
  Abstract: The relationship between different autoimmune diseases and bone mineral density (BMD) and fractures has been reported in epidemiological studies. This study aimed to explore the causal relationship between autoimmune diseases and BMD, falls, and fractures using Mendelian randomization (MR).The instrumental variables were selected from the aggregated statistical data of these diseases from the largest genome-wide association study in Europe. Specifically, 12 common autoimmune diseases were selected as exposure. Outcome variables included BMD, falls, and fractures. Multiple analysis methods were utilized to comprehensively evaluate the causal relationship between autoimmune diseases and BMD, falls, and fractures. Additionally, sensitivity analyses, including Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, and one analysis, were conducted to verify the result's reliability.Strong evidence was provided in the results of the negatively association of ulcerative colitis (UC) with forearm BMD. UC also had a negatively association with the total body BMD, while inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) depicted a negatively association with the total body BMD at the age of 45-60 years. Horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity was not detected through sensitivity analysis, indicating that the causal estimation was reliable.This study shows a negative causal relationship between UC and forearm and total body BMD, and between IBD and total body BMD at the age of 45-60 years. These results should be considered in future research and when public health measures and osteoporosis prevention strategies are formulated.Copyright © 2023 Wu, Ye, Yan, Zhan, Ren, Zhou, Chen, Yao, Zhu, Wu, Ma, Liu, Fan and Liu.

  Title: Suppressive role of vascular endothelial growth factor on intestinal apoptosis in induced necrotizing enterocolitis in rats.
  Keywords: Animal experimentation; Necrotizing enterocolitis; Vascular endothelial growth factor A
  PMID: 37693290
  Abstract: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating disease that can cause mortality in preterm babies. NEC may develop through an apoptotic pathway that is known to be inhibited by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This study determined whether VEGF exerted a protective effect against the development of NEC and apoptosis in rats.To determine the effect of VEGF in NEC rats, neonatal rats were randomized into 4 groups: the control group, the NEC group, the NEC + intraperitoneal VEGF (50 ng/kg) group (NEC + VEGF IP group), and the NEC + oral VEGF (50 ng/kg) group (NEC + VEGF OR group). NEC was induced by lipopolysaccharide/hypoxia and cold stress. The animals were sacrificed 72 hours later. After laparotomy, we obtained a region of the proximal small bowel from the ileocecal valve about 18 cm in length.The NEC histological grade, apoptosis histological score, and caspase-3 activity were lower in the NEC + VEGF IP and OR groups than in the NEC group. In the NEC + VEGF IP and OR groups, the messenger RNA expression of apoptotic and inflammatory genes, such as Bax, NF-κB, p53, Fas, FasL, and PAF-R, but not that of Bcl-2, was decreased, as was the Bax/Bcl-2 protein ratio. Histological analysis revealed that the apoptosis-blocking effect of VEGF was more effective in the NEC + VEGF IP group than in the NEC + VEGF OR group.We identified apoptotic and inflammatory genes to confirm the preventive effect of VEGF pretreatment on NEC in rats. This study presents a novel approach to prevent apoptosis via VEGF pretreatment in rats with lipopolysaccharide/hypoxia-induced NEC.Copyright © 2023, the Korean Surgical Society.

  Title: Therapeutic effect of bromelain and papain on intestinal injury induced by indomethacin in male rats.
  Keywords: Intestinal injury; bromelain; indomethacin; papain; sulfasalazine
  PMID: 37692988
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are a multiple inflammatory status in small intestines and colon. Bromelain and Papain were cysteine proteases enzymes extracted from pineapple and papaya, and possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory characteristics. Therefore, this comparative work aimed to examine the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effect of bromelain and papain in intestinal inflammation of rats and to evaluate the most potent effect of both types of enzymes.Forty rats were used in this study (8 rats/group), G1: control group, G2: (Indo group) intestinal inflammation was induced by two doses of Indomethacin (7.5 mg/kg body weight) apart 24 h. G3: (Indomethacin + Bromelain) intestinal inflamed rats treated by oral dose of bromelain (1000 mg/kg/day). G4: (Indomethacin + Papain) intestinal inflamed rats treated by oral dose of papain (800 mg/kg/day). G5: (Indomethacin + Sulfasalazine) intestinal inflamed rats treated by oral dose of sulfasalazine (500 mg/kg/day). Oxidative stress and inflammatory markers were measured along with histological assessment.Indomethacin-induced intestinal inflammation (in both Jejunum and Ileum) characterized by increased oxidative stress biomarkers: Xanthine oxidase, Catalase, Glutathione reductase, and Protein carbonyl and Inflammatory biomarkers: Tumor necrosis factor-α, Interleukin-10, Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, Nuclear factor-kappa β, C-reactive protein, and Prostaglandin E2, as compared to control rats. On the other hand, administering either bromelain or Papain would effectively decrease symptoms of intestinal inflammation and modulate biomarkers of oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines.Comparing results revealed that bromelain showed the most potent protective effect and possesses an apparent role in protection against the development of intestinal inflammation.Copyright: © International Journal of Health Sciences.

  Title: Association between inflammatory bowel disease and pancreatic cancer: results from the two-sample Mendelian randomization study.
  Keywords: Crohn’s disease; GWAS; inflammatory bowel disease; mendelian randomization; pancreatic cancer; risk factor; ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37692850
  Abstract: The nuanced relationship between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and pancreatic cancer is noticed in recent years. However, the underlying causal effects of these two diseases are still unclear.The two-sample mendelian randomization (MR) was conducted to explore the causal effect of IBD condition on pancreatic cancer. Methods of Wald ratio, inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode were used to investigate the causal relationship between IBD and pancreatic cancer. Besides, Cochrane's Q test, MR-Egger, and leave-one-out method were further conducted to detect heterogeneity, stability, and pleiotropy of MR results.In the MR analysis, we found Crohn's disease had a significant causal effect on pancreatic cancer. Specifically, Crohn's disease would increase 11.1% the risk of pancreatic cancer by the IVW method (p= 0.022), 33.8% by MR Egger (p= 0.015), by 35.3% by the Weighted model (p= 0.005). Regarding ulcerative colitis, there was no statistically significant causal effect observed on pancreatic cancer (p>0.05). Additionally, the pleiotropic test and Leave-one-out analysis both proved the validity and reliability of the present two-sample MR analyses.This study indicates that IBD, particularly Crohn's disease, is causality associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer. Our results may help public health managers to make better follow-up surveillance of IBD patients.Copyright © 2023 Min, Liu, Li, Jin, Wei, Pei, Hu and Peng.

  Title: Association of serum lipids with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
  Keywords: Cronh’s disease; inflammatory bowel disease; meta-analysis; serum lipids; ulcerative disease
  PMID: 37692785
  Abstract: Serum lipid levels seem to be abnormal in Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the specific manifestation of abnormal serum lipid levels in IBD are heterogeneous among studies and have not been sufficiently determined yet.PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched. Serum lipid levels were compared between IBD patients and Health individuals, Crohn's (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), active and inactive, mild and non-mild patients, respectively. Meta-analyses were performed by using a random-effect model. Weight mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.Overall, 53 studies were included. Compared with healthy controls, IBD patients had significantly lower TC (WMD = -0.506, 95%CI = -0.674 to -0.338, p < 0.001), HDL-c (WMD = -0.122, 95%CI = -0.205 to -0.039, p = 0.004), and LDL-c (WMD = -0.371, 95%CI = -0.547 to -0.194, p < 0.001) levels. CD groups had a significantly lower TC (WMD = -0.349, 95%CI = -0.528 to -0.170, p < 0.0001) level as compared to UC groups. Active IBD and non-mild UC groups had significantly lower TC (WMD = -0.454, 95%CI = -0.722 to -0.187, p = 0.001) (WMD =0.462, 95%CI = 0.176 to 0.748, p = 0.002) and LDL-c (WMD = -0.225, 95%CI = -0.445 to -0.005, p = 0.045) (WMD =0.346, 95%CI = 0.084-0.609, p = 0.010) levels as compared to inactive IBD and mild UC groups, respectively.The overall level of serum lipids in IBD patients is lower than that of healthy individuals and is negatively associated with disease severity.https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier: CRD42022383885.Copyright © 2023 Chen, Li, Hu, Xu, Lu, Zhu and Shen.

  Title: Guardians of the gut: influence of the enteric nervous system on the intestinal epithelial barrier.
  Keywords: enteric glia; enteric nervous system; gut epithelial barrier; inflammatory bowel disease; intrinsic primary afferent neurons
  PMID: 37692784
  Abstract: The intestinal mucosal surface forms one of the largest areas of the body, which is in direct contact with the environment. Co-ordinated sensory functions of immune, epithelial, and neuronal cells ensure the timely detection of noxious queues and potential pathogens and elicit proportional responses to mitigate the threats and maintain homeostasis. Such tuning and maintenance of the epithelial barrier is constantly ongoing during homeostasis and its derangement can become a gateway for systemic consequences. Although efforts in understanding the gatekeeping functions of immune cells have led the way, increasing number of studies point to a crucial role of the enteric nervous system in fine-tuning and maintaining this delicate homeostasis. The identification of immune regulatory functions of enteric neuropeptides and glial-derived factors is still in its infancy, but has already yielded several intriguing insights into their important contribution to the tight control of the mucosal barrier. In this review, we will first introduce the reader to the current understanding of the architecture of the enteric nervous system and the epithelial barrier. Next, we discuss the key discoveries and cellular pathways and mediators that have emerged as links between the enteric nervous, immune, and epithelial systems and how their coordinated actions defend against intestinal infectious and inflammatory diseases. Through this review, the readers will gain a sound understanding of the current neuro-immune-epithelial mechanisms ensuring intestinal barrier integrity and maintenance of intestinal homeostasis.Copyright © 2023 Bubeck, Becker and Patankar.

  Title: Clostridioides difficile Infection in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Systematic Review of Risk Factors and Approach in Management.
  Keywords: chron’s disease; clostridioides difficile infection; inflammatory bowel disease; risk factors  ; ulcerative colıtıs
  PMID: 37692651
  Abstract: Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is one of the most common diseases associated with medical care, having a more significant impact on patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The latest studies have proposed a change in management for CDI in IBD patients. This study aims to perform a systematic review that explores the risk factors associated with the infection and the most optimal approach in management. Multiple databases were used for this research, including PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Cochrane Library. Studies published in the last five years in the English language were selected based on pre-established criteria. The quality assessment used was the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Review, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria in this systematic review, including literature reviews, a case and control study, and systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Based on the findings in this research, we conclude that the treatment for an initial episode of CDI in IBD patients is the use of antibiotics, vancomycin, or fidaxomicin. For episodes of recurrent CDI (rCDI), fetal microbiota transplantation should be considered. The most common risk factors associated are gut microbiota disturbances, the use of antibiotics, and hospitalization. Due to a wide range of risk factors mentioned in some studies but disregarded in others, further research is needed to determine the most prevalent risk factors.Copyright © 2023, Sangurima et al.

  Title: Patient perceptions of copay card utilization and policies.
  Keywords: Accumulator; copay assistance programs; insurance design; maximizer; out-of-pocket healthcare costs; prescription drug patient assistance programs
  PMID: 37692554
  Abstract: Copay cards are intended to mitigate patient out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses. This qualitative, exploratory focus group study aimed to capture patient perceptions of copay cards and copay adjustment programs (CAPs; insurers' accumulator and maximizer policies), which redirect the copay card utilization benefits intended for patients' OOP expenses.Patients with chronic conditions were recruited through Janssen's Patient Engagement Research Council program. They completed a survey and attended a live virtual session to provide feedback on copay cards.Among 33 participants (median age, 49 years [range, 24-78]), the most frequent conditions were cardiovascular-metabolic disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Patients associated copay cards with lessening financial burden, improving general and mental health, and enabling medication adherence. An impact on medication adherence was identified by 10 (63%) White and nine (100%) Black respondents. Some patients were unaware of CAPs despite having encountered them; they recommended greater copay card education and transparency about CAPs.Patients relied on copay cards to help afford their prescribed medication OOP expenses and maintain medication adherence. Use of CAPs may increase patient OOP expenses. Patients would benefit from awareness programs and industry - healthcare provider partnerships that facilitate and ensure access to copay cards.© 2023 Jannsen Scientific Affairs, LLC.

  Title: The link between psoriasis and other diseases based on epidemiological and genetic analyses.
  Keywords: GWAS; comorbidities; epidemiology; psoriasis
  PMID: 37692276
  Abstract: Psoriasis is a chronic disease, which is associated with numerous genetic and environmental factors. The high prevalence of psoriasis worldwide (2-3% of the general population) and its various comorbidities lead to research on its pathogenesis. The aim of this article is to describe the current state of knowledge on the potential links between psoriasis and other diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases, uveitis, arthritis, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, fatty liver disease, dyslipidaemia, sleep apnoea, celiac disease, lymphoma, erectile dysfunction, Parkinson's disease, osteoporosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, psychiatric disorders and substance use. Further research in this area may lead to better treatment options in the future.Copyright: © 2023 Termedia Sp. z o. o.

  Title: Inflammation in the proximal colon is a risk factor for the development of colorectal neoplasia in inflammatory bowel disease patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.
  Keywords: IBD variants; dysplasia; right colon
  PMID: 37692199
  Abstract: Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased risk of developing colorectal neoplasia (CRN) in the proximal colon.To evaluate whether duration and severity of inflammation are linked to the development of CRN in this population.Retrospective, case-control chart review of patients with PSC and IBD at a tertiary care center.Disease activity was scored per colonic segment at each colonoscopy prior to the first instance of observed CRN using a modified Mayo endoscopic sub-score and histologic assessment. Patients in the CRN-positive group were compared to controls that did not.In all, 72 PSC-IBD patients with no history of CRN were identified, 13 of whom developed CRN after at least one colonoscopy at our institution. Patients in the CRN-positive group had significantly more endoscopic (p < 0.01) and histologic (p < 0.01) inflammation in the right compared to the control group prior to the development of dysplasia. There was significantly greater endoscopic inflammation in the segment of the colon with a dysplastic lesion than other segments of the colon (p = 0.018). Patients with moderate/severe lifetime endoscopic (p = 0.02) or histologic inflammation (p = 0.04) score had a lower probability of remaining free of dysplasia during follow-up. Nearly half of the patients with dysplasia had invisible lesions found on random biopsy.Endoscopic and histologic inflammation in the proximal colon are risk factors for CRN in patients with PSC-IBD. PSC-IBD patients frequently have subclinical inflammation, and these findings support the practice of regular assessment of disease activity and random biopsy of inflamed and uninflamed areas in patients with PSC with the goal of reducing inflammation to prevent the development of CRN.© The Author(s), 2023.

  Title: The persistence of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies after COVID-19: A one-year observation. Is a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination booster dose necessary?
  Keywords: COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; vaccination
  PMID: 37692027
  Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) one year after contracting COVID-19.The study included 38 patients - 34 men and 4 women - suffering from COVID-19 between March 15 and May 26, 2020. The median age in the group was 31 years, ranging from 22 to 67 years. The levels of neutralizing antibodies were measured at three time-points - baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. The primary endpoint was a post-infection positive result for NAbs (> 15 AU/ml; Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG quantitative test) 12 months after infection.The median level of NAbs after 12 months was 26.5 AU/ml. At the end of observation (12 months), 21 of the 38 patients had a NAb level of >15 AU/ml (positive). The median antibody half-life was 5.8 months.A high percentage of the patients maintained positive levels of antibodies 6 and 12 months after COVID-19 infection. The dynamics of the antibody level decline suggests the need for booster vaccination at least once a year.Copyright © 2023 Termedia.

At the end of observation (12 months), 21 of the 38 patients had a NAb level of >15 AU/ml (positive). The median antibody half-life was 5.8 months.A high percentage of the patients maintained positive levels of antibodies 6 and 12 months after COVID-19 infection. The dynamics of the antibody level decline suggests the need for booster vaccination at least once a year.Copyright © 2023 Termedia.

  Title: IBD Camp Oasis: A look at Participants' Social-Emotional Well-Being and Protective Factors During Camp and Beyond.
  Keywords: Crohn’s disease; IBD; camp; mental health; pediatric IBD; ulcerative colitis; well-being
  PMID: 37691728
  Abstract: Camp Oasis is an annual week-long camp serving children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and hosted by the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation. Youth with IBD are at increased risk for mental health challenges, with Camp Oasis potentially mitigating these risks. The aim of this study is to measure change in and predictors of social-emotional well-being and protective factors of self-worth as a result of attending Camp Oasis.Between 2012 and 2019, a voluntary survey was administered to participants and their caregivers to reflect on their perceptions of social/emotional well-being and protective factors related to chronic disease. T-tests compared change in participants' and caregivers' perceptions before and after camp; path analyses examined the key predictors of social-emotional well-being.A total of 6011 online surveys were analyzed. Participants and caregivers reported consistently positive perceptions of participants' experiences during and after camp. Significant improvements in confidence, independence, activity, comfort around others, being more open about disease, and taking medication as expected were observed. Being new to Camp Oasis was one of the strongest predictors of both disease-related self-efficacy and social connections after camp.The uniformly high rates of participants' perceptions during camp suggest camp is a life-changing experience for youth with IBD, reduces disease-related stigma, and enhances confidence and social skills. Participants' positive experiences appear to foster notable benefits after camp in terms of openness, their sense of belonging, connections, and confidence.© The Author(s) 2023.

  Title: Defects in microvillus crosslinking sensitize to colitis and inflammatory bowel disease.
  Keywords: CDHR5; MUCDHL; brush border; colitis; microvilli
  PMID: 37691494
  Abstract: Intestinal epithelial cells are covered by the brush border, which consists of densely packed microvilli. The Intermicrovillar Adhesion Complex (IMAC) links the microvilli and is required for proper brush border organization. Whether microvillus crosslinking is involved in the intestinal barrier function or colitis is currently unknown. We investigate the role of microvillus crosslinking in colitis in mice with deletion of the IMAC component CDHR5. Electron microscopy shows pronounced brush border defects in CDHR5-deficient mice. The defects result in severe mucosal damage after exposure to the colitis-inducing agent DSS. DSS increases the permeability of the mucus layer and brings bacteria in direct contact with the disorganized brush border of CDHR5-deficient mice. This correlates with bacterial invasion into the epithelial cell layer which precedes epithelial apoptosis and inflammation. Single-cell RNA sequencing data of patients with ulcerative colitis reveals downregulation of CDHR5 in enterocytes of diseased areas. Our results provide experimental evidence that a combination of microvillus crosslinking defects with increased permeability of the mucus layer sensitizes to inflammatory bowel disease.© 2023 The Authors.

  Title: Systemic immune-inflammation index as a potential biomarker to monitor ulcerative colitis.
  Keywords: endoscopic improvement; histological healing; systemic immune-inflammation index; treat-to-target; ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37691449
  Abstract: The treat-to-target strategy is recommended by Selecting Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease II (STRIDE-II) for treating ulcerative colitis (UC), and monitoring remission status is crucial during this management. The systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), defined as platelet * neutrophil/lymphocyte, is a complete blood count-based index reflecting the balance of immune and inflammatory status. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of SII for diagnosing UC and monitoring UC disease activity.This study retrospectively analyzed patients with UC and controls. Relationships between SII and Mayo clinical score, Mayo Endoscopic Score (MES), and Nancy Histological Index (NHI) were evaluated.167 patients with UC and 106 controls were included. SII significantly increased in patients with UC and was closely correlated with the Mayo clinical score, MES, and NHI. SII diagnosed UC with a cut-off value of 619.1 × 109/L (area under the curve = 0.861, p < 0.0001, sensitivity 79.64%, specificity 77.36%), evaluated clinical remission status with a cut-off value of 1068 × 109/L (area under the curve = 0.691, p < 0.05, sensitivity 55.71%, specificity 81.48%), endoscopic improvement with a cut-off value of 981.3 × 109/L (area under the curve = 0.819, p < 0.0001, sensitivity 65.22%, specificity 89.66%), and histological healing with a cut-off value of 689.3 × 109/L (area under the curve = 0.898, p < 0.0001, sensitivity 88.89%, specificity 95.83%).SII is a potential biomarker for diagnosing UC and monitoring UC disease severity, especially in evaluating mucosal and histological healing during the long-term management in treat-to-target strategy. However, further research is needed to confirm its usefulness and optimize its clinical application.

  Title: High-Salt-Diet (HSD) aggravates the progression of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) via regulating epithelial necroptosis.
  Keywords: HSD; IBD; Necroptosis; RIPK3
  PMID: 37691056
  Abstract: Due to its unclear etiology, there is no specific medicine to cure the recurrent and incurable inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Unhealthy dietary habits unconsciously contributed to the progression of IBD, for example a High-Salt-Diet (HSD) is the most neglected and frequently adopted habit. However, the molecular mechanism of how HSD aggravates the progression of IBD has yet to remain uncovered. Herein, we focus on the hypothesis that necroptosis pathway may be involved in the process of IBD exacerbated by HSD. To this end, different gene expression (DEGs) profiles of human epithelia under hypertonic culture conditions were applied to screen candidate pathways. What's more, gene expression manipulation, immune microenvironment detection, RIPK3/MLKL gene knockout (KO), and wild-type (WT) mice were carried out to research the promotion of IBD progression under treatments of high salt intake. Based on our present results, gene expression profiles in human normal colon epithelia cell NCM460 were significantly changed under salt- or sucrose-induced hypertonic culture conditions. RIPK3 was significantly up-regulated under both conditions. Furthermore, mice colon epithelia cell CT26 growth was inhibited in a time- and dose-dependent manner by extra NaCl incubation. Autophagy, and Necroptosis pathways were activated and enhanced by LPS pretreatment. HSD significantly exacerbated DSS-induced IBD symptoms in vivo in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, RIPK3-/- and MLKL-/- mice presented severe IBD symptoms in vivo. Overall, the results demonstrated that HSD aggravated the IBD progression via necroptosis activation, providing novel strategies and promising targets for the clinical treatment of IBD.© 2023.

  Title: [A case of ulcerative colitis with mesalazine intolerance complicated with agranulocytosis and septic shock during salazosulfapyridine administration].
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37690832
  Abstract: A 73-year-old woman developed ulcerative colitis with mesalazine intolerance a year ago. She relapsed 10 months later. Although she was in clinical remission with salazosulfapyridine (SASP) and prednisolone administration, she developed agranulocytosis 53 days following SASP administration. She went into septic shock;however, she recovered with antibiotics, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and cardiotonic agents. Drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test was positive for both mesalazine and SASP. Drug selection should be carefully determined in patients with 5-aminosalicylic acid intolerance.

  Title: Esculentoside A ameliorates BSCB destruction in SCI rat by attenuating the TLR4 pathway in vascular endothelial cells.
  Keywords: Blood spinal cord barrier; Esculentoside A; MMP-9; Spinal cord injury; TLR4
  PMID: 37690527
  Abstract: Overexpressed MMP-9 in vascular endothelial cells is involved in blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) dysfunction in spinal cord injury (SCI). Esculentoside A (EsA) has anti-inflammatory and cell protective effects. This study aimed to evaluate its effects on neuromotor function in SCI rats, as well as the potential mechanisms.The therapeutic effect of EsA in SCI rats was investigated using Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scores, a grid walk test and histological analyses. To assess the protective role of EsA in the BSCB and in oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-induced hBMECs, the BSCB function, tight junctions (TJ) protein (ZO-1 and claudin-5) expression, structure of the BSCB and Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression were observed via Evans blue (EB) detection, immunofluorescence analyses and western blotting. Molecular docking simulations and additional experiments were performed to explore the potential mechanisms by which EsA maintains the function of the BSCB in vivo and in vitro.EsA treatment improved BBB scores, reduced cavity formation and the loss of neuronal cells, demonstrating an improvement in motor function in SCI rats. In vivo experiments showed that EsA decreased the infiltration of blood cells and inflammatory mediators (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) and protected the structure of TJs in the rat spinal cord and in OGD/R-induced hBMECs. EsA inhibited the activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signalling, which may be related to the protective effect of EsA against MMP-9-induced BSCB damage.EsA downregulated MMP-9 expression in vascular endothelial cells, protected BSCB function in SCI rats and attenuated TLR4 signalling and thus provide new options for the treatment of SCI.Copyright © 2023.

  Title: Management of the Rectal Stump after Subtotal Colectomy Operations for Inflammatory Bowel Disease in the Era of Immunologic Therapy: A Two-Centre Cohort Study.
  Keywords: Completion proctectomy; Immunobiologic therapy; Inflammatory bowel disease; Rectal stump; Subtotal colectomy
  PMID: 37690444
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often requires surgical resection, such as subtotal colectomy operations to alleviate symptoms. However, IBD also has an inherently increased risk of colorectal dysplasia and cancer. Despite the well-accepted surveillance guidelines for IBD patients with an intact colon, contemporaneous decision-making models on rectal stump surveillance is sparse. This study looks at the fate of rectal stumps in IBD patients following subtotal colectomy.This is a two-centre retrospective observational cohort study. Patients were identified from NHS Grampian and NHS Highland surgical IBD databases. Patients that had subtotal colectomy between January 01, 2010 and December 31, 2017 were included with the follow-up end date on April 1, 2021. Socio-demographics, diagnosis, medical and surgical management data were collected from electronic records.Of 250 patients who had subtotal colectomy procedures, only one developed a cancer in their rectal stump (0.4%) over a median follow-up of 80 months. A higher than expected 72% of patients had ongoing symptoms from their rectal stumps. Surveillance was varied and inconsistent. However, no surveillance, flexible sigmoidoscopy, or MRI identified dysplastic or neoplastic disease.Based on our results, we estimate that the prevalence of rectal cancer is lower than previously reported. Surveillance strategy of rectal stump varied as no current guidelines exist and hence is an important area for future study. Given the relatively low frequency of rectal cancer in these patients, and the low level of evidence available in this field, we would propose a registry-based approach to answering this important clinical question.© 2023 The Author(s).

  Title: Artificial Intelligence Quantifying Endoscopic Severity of Ulcerative Colitis in Gradation Scale.
  Keywords: Artificial Intelligence; Convolutional Neural Network; Ranking; Ulcerative Colitis
  PMID: 37690125
  Abstract: Existing endoscopic scores for Ulcerative Colitis (UC) objectively categorize the disease severity based on the presence or absence of endoscopic findings. Therefore, it may not reflect the range of clinical severity within each category. However, Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) expert endoscopists categorize the severity and diagnose the overall impression of the degree of inflammation. This study aimed to develop artificial intelligence (AI) system that can accurately represent the assessment of the endoscopic severity of UC by IBD expert endoscopists.A ranking-convolutional neural network (ranking-CNN) was trained using comparative information on the UC severity of 13,826 endoscopic images pairs created by IBD expert endoscopists. Using the trained ranking-CNN, the UC Endoscopic Gradation Scale (UCEGS) was used to express severity. Correlation coefficients were calculated to ensure that there were no inconsistencies in assessments of severity made using UCEGS diagnosed by the AI and the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES), and the correlation coefficients of the mean for test images that had been assessed using UCEGS by four IBD expert endoscopists, and the AI.Spearman's correlation coefficient between the UCEGS diagnosed by AI and MES was approximately 0.89. The correlation coefficients between IBD expert endoscopists and the AI of the evaluation results were all higher than 0.95 (P<0.01).The AI developed here can diagnose UC severity endoscopically similar to IBD expert endoscopists.

  Title: Colon-Accumulated Gold Nanoclusters Alleviate Intestinal Inflammation and Prevent Secondary Colorectal Carcinogenesis via Nrf2-Dependent Macrophage Reprogramming.
  Keywords: M2 macrophages; Nrf2; colitis-associated colorectal cancer; gold nanoclusters; inflammatory bowel disease; macrophage polarization; nanomedicine
  PMID: 37690027
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is one of the main factors leading to colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). Therefore, it is critical to develop an effective treatment for IBD to prevent secondary colorectal carcinogenesis. M2 macrophages play crucial roles in the resolution phase of intestinal inflammation. However, traditional drugs rarely target intestinal M2 macrophages, and they are not easily cleared. Gold nanoclusters are known for their in vivo safety and intrinsic biomedical activities. In this study, a glutathione-protected gold nanocluster is synthesized and evaluated, namely, GA. Interestingly, GA specifically accumulates in the colon during IBD. Furthermore, GA not only promotes M2 differentiation of IL-4-treated peritoneal macrophages but also reprograms macrophage polarization from M1 to M2 in a pro-inflammatory environment. Mechanistically, this regulatory effect is exerted through activating the antioxidant Nrf2 signaling pathway, but not traditional STAT6. When applied in IBD mice, we found that GA elevates M2 macrophages and alleviates IBD in an Nrf2-dependent manner, evidenced by the abolished therapeutic effect upon Nrf2 inhibitor treatment. Most importantly, GA administration significantly suppresses AOM/DSS-induced CAC, without causing obvious tissue damage, providing critical evidence for the potential application of gold nanoclusters as nanomedicine for the treatment of IBD and CAC.

  Title: Detecting potential causal relationship between inflammatory bowel disease and rosacea using bi-directional Mendelian randomization.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37689807
  Abstract: The association between rosacea and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been studied in previous observational studies. It is unclear, however, whether the association is causal or not. Independent genetic variants for IBD were chosen as instruments from published Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) studies involving 38,155 cases with an IBD diagnosis and 48,485 controls in order to investigate the causal effect of IBD on rosacea. Summarized data for rosacea were gathered from various GWAS studies that included 1195 cases and 211,139 controls without rosacea. Reverse-direction Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was done to investigate the relationship between genetically proxied rosacea and IBD. With the use of the inverse variance-weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, and weighted median approaches, a 2-sample Mendelian randomization study was carried out. Analysis of heterogeneity and sensitivity was performed to examine the pleiotropy and robustness of effect estimates. The forward-direction of the MR study was to reveal that genetic predisposition to IBD including its two main subtypes: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) was associated with an increased risk of rosacea. The reverse-direction MR analyses did not demonstrate that a genetic predisposition to rosacea was associated with total IBD, UC and CD. Our findings provided evidence for a causal impact of IBD, UC, and CD on rosacea, but not vice versa. The elevated incidence of rosacea in patients with IBD should be recognized by doctors to make an early diagnosis and initiate specialized therapy.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited.

  Title: Adropin deficiency worsens TNBS-induced colitis.
  Keywords: Adropin; Inflammatory bowel disease; Metabolomics; PPARγ; Polarization of macrophages
  PMID: 37688913
  Abstract: The aim of this study was to describe the effects of adropin deficiency on the distribution, phenotype and pathological phenotype of macrophages in colonic and mesenteric tissues of AdrKO (Enho-/-) mice, so as to explore the mechanism of adropin deficiency in spontaneous and experimental colitis. In this study, RNA-seq and metabonomics were used to screen the regulatory mechanism of adropin on the phenotypic transformation of macrophages. We found that adropin levels in active UC patients were significantly lower than those in normal subjects and remission UC patients, and at the same time, a large number of proinflammatory M1-type macrophages were infiltrated in the mesenteric tissue of colonic tissues from UC and CD patients. At the same time, spontaneous colitis occurred in Enho-/- (adropin-deficient)C57BL/6 mice, and there was an imbalance of M2 → M1 polarization of macrophages in colon and mesentery of Enho-/- mice. In vivo, it has showed that adropin deficiency could exacerbate the pathological phenotype of colitis induced by TNBS. In vitro, adropin was used to intervene RAW264.7 macrophages, and then combined analysis of RNA-seq and metabolomics demonstrated that adropin regulated lipid metabolism of macrophages through PPARγ, thus promoting the repolarization of macrophages from M1 to M2. Adropin deficiency led to an imbalance in the phenotypic distribution of macrophages infiltrating the colon and mesenteric tissues, namely, an increase in M1 type, which led to the occurrence and development of colitis.Copyright © 2023.

  Title: Research models to mimic Necrotizing Enterocolitis and Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: focus on Extracellular Vesicles action.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37688386
  Abstract: This review focuses on the crucial role of the Intestinal epithelium in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and its significance in the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). NEC is a devastating neonatal disease, while IBD represents a global healthcare problem with increasing incidence. The breakdown of the intestinal barrier in neonates is considered pivotal in the development and progression of both disorders. This review provides an overview of the current state of in-vitro, ex-vivo and animal models to study epithelial injury in NEC and IBD, addressing pertinent questions that engage clinicians and researchers alike. Despite significant advancements in early recognition and aggressive treatment, no single therapy has been conclusively proven effective in reducing the severity of these disorders. Although early interventions have improved clinical outcomes, NEC and IBD continue to impose substantial morbidity, mortality and economic burdens on affected individuals and society. Consequently, exploring alternative therapeutic options capable of preventing and treating the sequelae of NEC and IBD has become a pressing necessity. In recent decades, extracellular vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a potential solution to modulate the pathogenic mechanism in these multifactorial and complex disorders. Despite the diverse array of proposed models, a comprehensive model to investigate and decelerate the progression of NEC and IBD remains to be established. To bridge the translational gap between preclinical studies and clinical applications, enhancements in the technical development of gut-on-a-chip models and EVs hold considerable promise.© The Author(s) 2023.

  Title: Momordica charantia-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Provide Antioxidant Protection in Ulcerative Colitis.
  Keywords: Momordica charantia; antioxidant; extracellular vesicles; protein domain analysis; ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37687011
  Abstract: Plant-derived extracellular vesicles are functional nanovesicles that have significant applications in both disease prevention and treatment, as well as for use as drug carriers. Momordica charantia is a widely consumed food that has both medicinal and nutritional properties and has shown intervention in diabetes and inflammation caused by oxidative damage. In this study, Momordica charantia-derived extracellular vesicles (MCEVs) were extracted and demonstrated to have excellent antioxidant activity by characterization, lipid composition analysis, protein domain analysis, and in vitro antioxidant measurement. In addition, in vivo studies indicated that the MCEVs could restore ulcerative colitis by regulating oxidation and inflammatory factors. Therefore, the antioxidant properties of MCEVs may be important in protecting the colon from inflammation, which provides new insights into the application of MCEVs as drugs or vectors for intervention in ulcerative colitis.

  Title: Magnetic Resonance Imaging Can Be Used to Assess Sarcopenia in Children with Newly Diagnosed Crohn's Disease.
  Keywords: body composition; children; inflammatory bowel disease; paraspinal muscle; psoas muscle
  PMID: 37686870
  Abstract: This study aimed to determine the proportion of patients with sarcopenia diagnosed by MRI and compare these results to bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA).Children with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease (CD) who had MRI enterography (MRE) and BIA and had at least 12 months of follow-up were included. Total psoas muscle area (TPMA) and total paravertebral muscle (TPVM) were measured and compared to subjects' lean mass and the lean mass body index (LMBI) was assessed by BIA.30 newly diagnosed children with CD were included (mean age 14.2 years, 53% male). Sarcopenia was found in 13 (43%) children; mean TPMA was 15.2 (1.1 SD) cm2 and TPVM 30.95 (1.7 SD) cm2. A highly positive correlation was shown for lean mass assessed by BIA and TPMA (0.706, p < 0.001) and TPVM (0.75, p < 0.001). Sarcopenia was more prevalent in boys (77% vs. 24%, p = 0.004), patients with the perianal disease (69% vs. 29%, p = 0.03), and children with sarcopenia were likely to receive anti-TNF (77% vs. 41%, p = 0.05). During the follow-up period, 16 (53%) children experienced a relapse. TPMA (HR 0.99, p = 0.018) and TPVM (HR 0.99, p = 0.031) values were statistically significant risk factors for relapse.A high proportion of patients with CD have sarcopenia at the time of the diagnosis. There is a good correlation between muscle mass assessed by MRI and BIA. Because MRI is performed in a great proportion of newly diagnosed CD patients it can also be used to assess the presence of sarcopenia.

  Title: Nutrition, Nutritional Status, Micronutrients Deficiency, and Disease Course of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Keywords: anemia; inflammatory bowel disease; micronutrients; nutrition; obesity; sarcopenia
  PMID: 37686856
  Abstract: During the disease course, most Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients present a condition of malnutrition, undernutrition, or even overnutrition. These conditions are mainly due to suboptimal nutritional intake, alterations in nutrient requirements and metabolism, malabsorption, and excessive gastrointestinal losses. A suboptimal nutritional status and low micronutrient serum levels can have a negative impact on both induction and maintenance of remission and on the quality of life of Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients. We performed a systematic review including all the studies evaluating the connection between nutrition, nutrition status (including undernutrition and overnutrition), micronutrient deficiency, and both disease course and therapeutic response in Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients. This systematic review was performed using PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus. Four main clinical settings concerning the effect of nutrition on disease course in adult Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients were analyzed (induction of remission, maintenance of remission, risk of surgery, post-operative recurrence, and surgery-related complications). Four authors independently reviewed abstracts and manuscripts for eligibility. 6077 articles were found; 762 duplicated studies were removed. Out of 412 full texts analyzed, 227 were included in the review. The evidence summarized in this review showed that many nutritional aspects could be potential targets to induce a better control of symptoms, a deeper remission, and overall improve the quality of life of Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients.

  Title: The Importance of Antioxidant Activity for the Health-Promoting Effect of Lycopene.
  Keywords: lycopene; neurodegenerative diseases; neuroinflammation
  PMID: 37686853
  Abstract: Lycopene is a compound of colored origin that shows strong antioxidant activity. The positive effect of lycopene is the result of its pleiotropic effect. The ability to neutralize free radicals via lycopene is one of the foundations of its pro-health effect, including the ability to inhibit the development of many civilization diseases. Therefore, this study focuses on the importance of the antioxidant effect of lycopene in inhibiting the development of diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diseases within the nervous system, diabetes, liver diseases, and ulcerative colitis. According to the research mentioned, lycopene supplementation has significant promise for the treatment of illnesses marked by chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. However, the majority of the supporting data for lycopene's health benefits comes from experimental research, whereas the evidence from clinical studies is both scarcer and less certain of any health benefits. Research on humans is still required to establish its effectiveness.

  Title: VDUP1 Deficiency Promotes the Severity of DSS-Induced Colitis in Mice by Inducing Macrophage Infiltration.
  Keywords: NF-κB; VDUP1; inflammation; macrophage infiltration; ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37686390
  Abstract: The loss of vitamin D3 upregulated protein 1 (VDUP1) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various inflammation-related diseases. Notably, reduced expression of VDUP1 has been observed in clinical specimens of ulcerative colitis (UC). However, the role of VDUP1 deficiency in colitis remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of VDUP1 in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental colitis in mice. VDUP1-deficient mice were more susceptible to DSS-induced colitis than their wild-type (WT) littermates after 2% DSS administration. VDUP1-deficient mice exhibited an increased disease activity index (DAI) and histological scores, as well as significant colonic goblet cell loss and an increase in apoptotic cells. These changes were accompanied by a significant decrease in MUC2 mRNA expression and a marked increase in proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines within damaged tissues. Furthermore, phosphorylated NF-κB p65 expression was significantly upregulated in damaged tissues in the context of VDUP1 deficiency. VDUP1 deficiency also led to significant infiltration of macrophages into the site of ulceration. An in vitro chemotaxis assay confirmed that VDUP1 deficiency enhanced bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) chemotaxis induced by CCL2. Overall, this study highlights VDUP1 as a regulator of UC pathogenesis and a potential target for the future development of therapeutic strategies.

  Title: Long Non-Coding RNAs and Their "Discrete" Contribution to IBD and Johne's Disease-What Stands out in the Current Picture? A Comprehensive Review.
  Keywords: Crohn; Johne’s disease; biomarker; colitis; epigenetic; inflammatory bowel disease; long non-coding RNAs; mycobacter; regulation
  PMID: 37686376
  Abstract: Non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) have paved the way to new perspectives on the regulation of gene expression, not only in biology and medicine, but also in associated fields and technologies, ensuring advances in diagnostic means and therapeutic modalities. Critical in this multistep approach are the associations of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) with diseases and their causal genes in their networks of interactions, gene enrichment and expression analysis, associated pathways, the monitoring of the involved genes and their functional roles during disease progression from one stage to another. Studies have shown that Johne's Disease (JD), caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies partuberculosis (MAP), shares common lncRNAs, clinical findings, and other molecular entities with Crohn's Disease (CD). This has been a subject of vigorous investigation owing to the zoonotic nature of this condition, although results are still inconclusive. In this review, on one hand, the current knowledge of lncRNAs in cells is presented, focusing on the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal-related pathologies and MAP-related infections and, on the other hand, we attempt to dissect the associated genes and pathways involved. Furthermore, the recently characterized and novel lncRNAs share common pathologies with IBD and JD, including the expression, molecular networks, and dataset analysis results. These are also presented in an attempt to identify potential biomarkers pertinent to cattle and human disease phenotypes.

  Title: A Deep View of the Biological Property of Interleukin-33 and Its Dysfunction in the Gut.
  Keywords: IL-33; biological characteristics; gastrointestinal cancer; inflammatory bowel disease; nuclear IL-33
  PMID: 37686309
  Abstract: Intestinal diseases have always posed a serious threat to human health, with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) being one of them. IBD is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation, including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The "alarm" cytokine IL-33, which is intimately associated with Th2 immunity, is a highly potent inflammatory factor that is considered to have dual functions-operating as both a pro-inflammatory cytokine and a transcriptional regulator. IL-33 has been shown to play a crucial role in both the onset and development of IBD. Therefore, this review focuses on the pathogenesis of IBD, the major receptor cell types, and the activities of IL-33 in innate and adaptive immunity, as well as its underlying mechanisms and conflicting conclusions in IBD. We have also summarized different medicines targeted to IL-33-associated diseases. Furthermore, we have emphasized the role of IL-33 in gastrointestinal cancer and parasitic infections, giving novel prospective therapeutic utility in the future application of IL-33.

  Title: Inflammation and Digestive Cancer.
  Keywords: carcinogenesis; chronic gastritis; chronic hepatitis; colon cancer; gastric cancer; hepatocellular carcinoma; hormonal carcinogenesis; inflammation; inflammatory bowel disease; mechanism
  PMID: 37686307
  Abstract: Chronic inflammation is linked to carcinogenesis, particularly in the digestive organs, i.e., the stomach, colon, and liver. The mechanism of this effect has, however, only partly been focused on. In this review, we focus on different forms of chronic hepatitis, chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and chronic gastritis, conditions predisposing individuals to the development of malignancy. Chronic inflammation may cause malignancy because (1) the cause of the chronic inflammation is itself genotoxic, (2) substances released from the inflammatory cells may be genotoxic, (3) the cell death induced by the inflammation induces a compensatory increase in proliferation with an inherent risk of mutation, (4) changes in cell composition due to inflammation may modify function, resulting in hormonal disturbances affecting cellular proliferation. The present review focuses on chronic gastritis (Helicobacter pylori or autoimmune type) since all four mechanisms may be relevant to this condition. Genotoxicity due to the hepatitis B virus is an important factor in hepatocellular cancer and viral infection can similarly be central in the etiology and malignancy of inflammatory bowel diseases. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the dominating cause of chronic gastritis and has not been shown to be genotoxic, so its carcinogenic effect is most probably due to the induction of atrophic oxyntic gastritis leading to hypergastrinemia.

  Keywords: Crohn’s disease; biomarkers; endoscopy; inflammatory bowel disease; tumor necrosis factor inhibitors
  PMID: 37685662
  Abstract: Patients with Crohn's disease can present with a variety of clinical manifestations; treatment strategies should focus on long-term remission and improvement of quality of life. There is no standardized process of diagnosing, predicting prognosis, and treating the disease. This narrative review was based on a literature search using PubMed, Embase, and Science Direct. Data on unmet challenges in patients with Crohn's disease were extracted from identified manuscripts. The aim was to discuss present research on standardized processes in the management of patients with Crohn's disease and to identify the unmet needs in clinical evaluation and treatment approaches. There is no consensus on standardized diagnostic, treatment, and surveillance algorithms, particularly in assessing complications of Crohn's, such as stricturing disease, intestinal cancer risk, and cutaneous manifestations. Complications and treatment failure rates of conventional, interventional, and surgical therapy place emphasis on the need for standardized treatment algorithms, particularly in the case of acute complications of the disease. Research on standardized clinical approaches, reliable biomarkers for disease diagnosis and therapy monitoring, and new treatment agents is necessary to improve therapy and reduce complications in patients with Crohn's disease.

  Title: Crohn's Disease Prediction Using Sequence Based Machine Learning Analysis of Human Microbiome.
  Keywords: Machine Learning; bioinformatics; bowel disease; microbiota
  PMID: 37685376
  Abstract: Human microbiota refers to the trillions of microorganisms that inhabit our bodies and have been discovered to have a substantial impact on human health and disease. By sampling the microbiota, it is possible to generate massive quantities of data for analysis using Machine Learning algorithms. In this study, we employed several modern Machine Learning techniques to predict Inflammatory Bowel Disease using raw sequence data. The dataset was obtained from NCBI preprocessed graph representations and converted into a structured form. Seven well-known Machine Learning frameworks, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbor, were used. Grid Search was employed for hyperparameter optimization. The performance of the Machine Learning models was evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, fscore, kappa, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Additionally, Mc Nemar's test was conducted to assess the statistical significance of the experiment. The data was constructed using k-mer lengths of 3, 4 and 5. The Light Gradient Boosting Machine model overperformed over other models with 67.24%, 74.63% and 76.47% accuracy for k-mer lengths of 3, 4 and 5, respectively. The LightGBM model also demonstrated the best performance in each metric. The study showed promising results predicting disease from raw sequence data. Finally, Mc Nemar's test results found statistically significant differences between different Machine Learning approaches.

  Title: Vitamin D Deficiency (VDD) and Benefits of Supplementation in Veterans with IBS-D.
  Keywords: Body Mass Index (BMI); C-reactive protein (CRP); Gulf War veteran (GWV); Gulf War veterans (GWVs); diarrhea; gastrointestinal (GI); irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D); post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); traumatic brain injury (TBI); vitamin D deficiency (VDD)
  PMID: 37685345
  Abstract: Many veterans deployed to Gulf War areas suffer from persistent chronic diarrhea that is disabling and affects their quality of life. The causes for this condition have eluded investigators until recently and recent literature has shed light on the effect of vitamin D on the brain-gut axis. This study focused on determining clinical causes contributing to diarrhea and assessed whether reversing the identified causes, specifically vitamin D deficiency (VDD), could reduce the incidence of diarrhea in Gulf War veterans (GWVs). All patients completed a workup that included serologies (IBD, celiac), routine laboratory tests (CBC, chemistry panels, TSH, T4, CRP), cultures for enteric pathogens (C diff, bacteria, viruses, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)), and upper and lower endoscopies with histology and a trial of cholestyramine to exclude choleretic diarrhea and rifaximin for dysbiosis. A total of 4221 veterans were screened for chronic diarrhea, yielding 105 GWVs, of which 69 GWVs had irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D). Paired t-tests demonstrated that all GWVs had VDD (t-11.62, df68 and sig(2-tailed) 0.0001) (defined as a vitamin D level less than 30 ng/mL with normal ranges of 30-100 ng/mL) but no positive serologies, inflammatory markers, abnormal endoscopies, cultures, or histology to explain their persistent diarrhea. There was no correlation with age, BMI, or inflammation. Some zip codes had a higher frequency of GWVs with VDD, but the number of deployments had no impact. Treatment with vitamin D supplementation (3000-5000 units), given in the morning, based on weight, reduced the number of bowel movements per day (p < 0.0001) without causing hypercalcemia. We suggest that VDD is important in the etiology of IBS-D in GWVs and that vitamin D supplementation significantly reduces diarrhea.

  Title: Precision Medicine in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Keywords: Crohn’s disease (CD); artificial intelligence (AI); inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); precision medicine (PM); ulcerative colitis (UC)
  PMID: 37685335
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are traditionally defined as the two main subtypes of inflammatory bowel disease. However, a more recent view considers IBD as a spectrum of heterogeneous phenotypes with consistent differences in clinical presentation and behaviors, likely explained by differences in underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. The etiology is still elusive, and the suggested pathogenesis is a complex interplay among genetic predisposition and abnormal immune response at the mucosal intestinal level, activated by only partially identified environmental triggers leading to altered intestinal permeability and impaired handling of gut microbiota. The undeniable continuous progress of medical therapy with more frequent shifts from traditional to more advanced modalities also underlines the actual unmet needs. We are using medications with completely different mechanisms of action, with a lack of predictive factors of outcomes and response and still an unsatisfactory rate of success. In addition, we are missing still valuable and accurate markers to predict disease progression and severity in order to avoid under- or over-treatment. In such a complex scenario, it is undoubtful that the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms may improve the management and pave the way for precision and eventually personalized medicine in these patients; however, there are still several challenges that will be the focus of this review.

  Title: Evaluation of a Standardized Extract Obtained from Cashew Apple (Anacardium occidentale L.) Bagasse in DSS-Induced Mouse Colitis.
  Keywords: Anacardium occidentale L.; anacardic acids; carotenoids; colitis; food by-products; inflammatory bowel diseases
  PMID: 37685250
  Abstract: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) include Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Several studies relate eating habits to different aspects of IBD, such as progression and worsening of the clinical condition. Therefore, many natural products (NPs) such as polyphenols and carotenoids have been identified as promising agents in supporting IBD. An interesting source for obtaining bioactive NPs is the by-products of the food industry. The present study evaluated the potential beneficial effect of a standardized extract (CAE) obtained from cashew apple bagasse in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis model in mice. This was the first time that CAE had been evaluated in this experimental model. Chemical evaluation of CAE identified carotenoids (96.28 ± 0.15 mg/100 g), phenolic compounds (37.49 ± 0.64 mg/100 g), and a mixture of anacardic acids (C15:3 = 94.2 ± 0.6 mg/100 g; C15:2 = 108.4 ± 0.1 mg/100 g; C15:1 = 214.8 ± 0.2 mg/100 g). Administration of CAE (500 mg/kg, 4 days, p.o.) after DSS challenge was more effective in delaying disease progression compared with prior treatment (500 mg/kg, 30 days, p.o.), according to the disease activity index. However, no treatment strategy with CAE was able to prevent or inhibit disease progression, since all parameters evaluated (macroscopic, biochemical, and histopathological) in CAE-treated animals were similar to those observed in DSS-challenged animals. Despite the high dose (500 mg/kg), the standardized extract (CAE) did not result in an effective concentration of carotenoids. Furthermore, as some anacardic acids have been reported as histone acetyltransferases inhibitors, there could be a possible antagonistic relationship between carotenoids and anacardic acids. Complementary research will be necessary to test the hypothesis of antagonism. Thus, an optimized extract, with an even higher concentration of carotenoids, obtained from cashew apple bagasse, can be developed as a possible adjuvant food supplement for inflammatory bowel diseases.

  Title: Fecal Concentrations of Long-Chain Fatty Acids, Sterols, and Unconjugated Bile Acids in Cats with Chronic Enteropathy.
  Keywords: chronic inflammatory enteropathy; fecal metabolome; inflammatory bowel disease; lipid metabolism; low-grade intestinal T-cell lymphoma; small cell lymphoma
  PMID: 37685017
  Abstract: Chronic enteropathy (CE) in cats encompasses food-responsive enteropathy, chronic inflammatory enteropathy (or inflammatory bowel disease), and low-grade intestinal T-cell lymphoma. While alterations in the gut metabolome have been extensively studied in humans and dogs with gastrointestinal disorders, little is known about the specific metabolic profile of cats with CE. As lipids take part in energy storage, inflammation, and cellular structure, investigating the lipid profile in cats with CE is crucial. This study aimed to measure fecal concentrations of various fatty acids, sterols, and bile acids. Fecal samples from 56 cats with CE and 77 healthy control cats were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, targeting 12 fatty acids, 10 sterols, and 5 unconjugated bile acids. Fecal concentrations of nine targeted fatty acids and animal-derived sterols were significantly increased in cats with CE. However, fecal concentrations of plant-derived sterols were significantly decreased in cats with CE. Additionally, an increased percentage of primary bile acids was observed in a subset of cats with CE. These findings suggest the presence of lipid maldigestion, malabsorption, and inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract of cats with CE. Understanding the lipid alterations in cats with CE can provide insights into the disease mechanisms and potential future therapeutic strategies.

  Title: Selenobaculum gbiensis gen. nov. sp. nov., a new bacterium isolated from the gut microbiota of a patient with Crohn's disease.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37684335
  Abstract: The human gut microbiota is a complex ecology comprising approximately 10 to 100 trillion microbial cells. Most of the bacteria detected by 16s rRNA sequencing have yet to be cultured, but intensive attempts to isolate the novel bacteria have improved our knowledge of the gut microbiome composition and its roles within human host. In our culturomics study, a novel gram-negative, motile, obligately anaerobic, rod-shaped bacteria, designated as strain ICN-92133T, was isolated from a fecal sample of a 26-year-old patient with Crohn's disease. Based on the 16s rRNA sequence of strain ICN-92133T, the phylogeny analysis placed the strain into the family Selenomonadaceae, showing 93.91% similarity with the closely related Massilibacillus massiliensis strain DSM 102838T. Strain ICN-92133T exhibited a genome size of 2,679,003 bp with a GC content of 35.5% which was predicted to contain 26 potential virulence factors and five antimicrobial resistance genes. In comparative genomic analysis, strain ICN-92133T showed digital DNA-DNA Hybridization and OrthoANI values lower than 21.9% and 71.9% with the closest type strains, respectively. In addition, comparing phenotypic, biochemical, and cellular fatty acids with those of closely related strains revealed the distinctiveness of strain ICN-92133T. Based on the taxonogenomic results, strain ICN-92133T is proposed as a novel species belonging to a new genus. Therefore, we suggest the name of the new genus Selenobaculum gen. nov. within the family Selenomonadaceae and strain ICN-92133T (= KCTC 25622T = JCM 36070T) as a type strain of new species Selenobaculum gbiensis sp. nov.© 2023.

  Title: The association between Helicobacter pylori infection and inflammatory bowel disease in children: A systematic review with meta-analysis.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37682136
  Abstract: Available literature has reported the association of Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in adults. However, only a few studies have addressed the disease in children.To ascertain the correlation of H pylori infection with IBD among children.The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the association between H pylori infection and IBD in children. We searched databases including Cochrane, EMBASE, Google Scholar, PubMed, Medline, and Web of Science to select relevant studies. Ultimately, based on predetermined inclusion criteria, we included 6 studies that met the requirements. Review Manager and Stata software were used to extract and analyze the data from the relevant studies. In the methods, we employed both qualitative and quantitative approaches for comprehensive analysis. Qualitative analysis involved describing study designs, sample characteristics, and results, while quantitative analysis involved statistical tests such as calculating pooled risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals to evaluate the association between H pylori infection and IBD in children. Lastly, by combining the results of the individual studies, our objective is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between H pylori infection and IBD in children.In totality, we involved 2236 participants that were recruited in 6 studies. We detected no significant difference in H pylori prevalence (9.8% vs 12.7%, P = .12) by comparing the children IBD group to controls. Among the IBD children, we estimated odds ratio (OR) of H pylori infection to 0.62 [(95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.34-1.12)]. In children suffering from ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD), the H pylori infection rates were higher than in those with IBD-unclassified (IBDU).When analyzed stratified by disease of study design, In CD group [OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 0.72-2.80)] (I2 = 0%, P = .64). but no significant difference in CD group.No correlation was found between H pylori infection and the occurrence of IBD in children.Copyright © 2023 the Author(s).

  Title: Efficacy and Safety of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy in Fistulizing Crohn's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37682003
  Abstract: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) delivers 100% oxygen in a pressurized chamber, increasing tissue oxygen levels and regulating inflammatory pathways. Mounting evidence suggests that HBOT may be effective for inflammatory bowel disease. Our systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify the efficacy and safety of HBOT in fistulizing Crohn's disease (CD).A systematic review was conducted using the EMBASE, Web of Science, Pubmed, and Cochrane Library databases according to the "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses" criteria. Study bias was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook guidelines.Sixteen studies with 164 patients were included in the analysis. For all fistula subtypes, the pooled overall clinical response was 87% (95% CI: 0.70-0.95, I2 = 0) and the pooled clinical remission was 59% (95% CI: 0.35-0.80, I2 = 0). The overall clinical response was 89%, 84%, and 29% for perianal, enterocutaneous, and rectovaginal fistulas, respectively. On meta-regression, hours in the chamber and the number of HBOT sessions were not found to correlate with clinical response. The pooled number of adverse events was low at 51.7 per 10,000 HBOT sessions for all fistula types (95% CI: 16.8-159.3, I2 = 0). The risk of bias was observed across all studies.HBOT is a safe and potentially effective treatment option for fistulizing CD. Randomized control trials are needed to substantiate the benefit of HBOT in fistulizing CD.Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

  Title: miR-369-3p Modulates Intestinal Inflammatory Response via BRCC3/NLRP3 Inflammasome Axis.
  Keywords: BRCC3; NLRP3; inflammasome; miR-369-3p; microRNA
  PMID: 37681916
  Abstract: Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes expressed by immune cells in response to distinct stimuli that trigger inflammatory responses and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Evidence suggests a different role of inflammasome NLRP3 in IBD. NLRP3 inflammasome activation can be controlled by post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination through BRCC3. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of miR-369-3p on the expression and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes via BRCC3 regulation. After bioinformatics prediction of Brcc3 as a gene target of miR-369-3p, in vitro, we validated its modulation in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). The increase in miR-369-3p significantly reduced BRCC3 gene and protein expression. This modulation, in turn, reduced the expression of NLRP3 and blocked the recruitment of ASC adaptor protein by NLRP3. As a result, miR-369-3p reduced the activity of Caspase-1 by the inflammasome, decreasing the cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18. These results support a novel mechanism that seems to act on post-translational modification of NLRP3 inflammasome activation by BRCC3. This may be an interesting new target in the personalized treatment of inflammatory disorders, including IBD.

  Title: Atypical Immunoglobulin A Vasculitis in a Pediatric Patient With Ulcerative Colitis.
  Keywords: IgAV; immunoglobulin A vasculitis; pediatric; ulcerative colitis; vasculitis
  PMID: 37681212
  Abstract: Rates of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease and biologic therapy use continue to rise. Consequently, specialists and generalists should recognize potential complications and side effects. We report the unique case of an adolescent with ulcerative colitis (UC) on vedolizumab presenting with severe abdominal pain, hematochezia, and subsequent purpura. After extensive investigation and a complex clinical course, diagnosis of atypical immunoglobulin A vasculitis was made. This is the first pediatric case of vasculitis in a patient with UC on vedolizumab and only the second reported case overall in UC. This case illustrates the emerging diagnostic challenge of distinguishing inflammatory bowel disease treatment complications from other common pediatric conditions.© 2023 The Author(s).

  Title: The lung-gut crosstalk in respiratory and inflammatory bowel disease.
  Keywords: common mucosal immune system; inflammatory bowel disease; lung-gut crosstalk; microbiota; respiratory disease
  PMID: 37680747
  Abstract: Both lung and gut belong to the common mucosal immune system (CMIS), with huge surface areas exposed to the external environment. They are the main defense organs against the invasion of pathogens and play a key role in innate and adaptive immunity. Recently, more and more evidence showed that stimulation of one organ can affect the other, as exemplified by intestinal complications during respiratory disease and vice versa, which is called lung-gut crosstalk. Intestinal microbiota plays an important role in respiratory and intestinal diseases. It is known that intestinal microbial imbalance is related to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), this imbalance could impact the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier and leads to the persistence of inflammation, however, gut microbial disturbances have also been observed in respiratory diseases such as asthma, allergy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and respiratory infection. It is not fully clarified how these disorders happened. In this review, we summarized the latest examples and possible mechanisms of lung-gut crosstalk in respiratory disease and IBD and discussed the strategy of shaping intestinal flora to treat respiratory diseases.Copyright © 2023 Du, Fu, Han, Sun, Xu, Yang and Rong.

  Title: Tixagevimab and Cilgavimab (Evusheld) as Pre-exposure Prophylaxis for COVID-19 in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Propensity Matched Cohort Study.
  Keywords: COVID-19; cilgavimab; inflammatory bowel disease; tixagevimab
  PMID: 37680248
  Abstract: Tixagevimab and cilgavimab (Evusheld) are 2 fully human monoclonal antibodies that received emergency-use authorization on December 21, 2021, for pre-exposure prophylaxis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients who are moderate-severely immunocompromised. The real-world efficacy of Evusheld in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is not known.We conducted a retrospective cohort study using TriNetX, a multi-institutional database in patients with IBD who received Evusheld compared to patients with IBD who did not receive Evusheld (12.1.2021-10.28.2022). The primary outcome was to assess the risk of COVID-19 within 6 months. One-to-one propensity score matching (PSM) was performed for demographic parameters, comorbid conditions, IBD medications, and history of COVID-19. Risk was expressed as adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).Four hundred and eight patients (0.19%) with IBD received Evusheld (mean age 58.6 ± 15.4 years old, female 47.7%) during the study period. After PSM, there was no difference in the risk (aOR 0.88, 95% CI, 0.33-2.35) of COVID-19 in the Evusheld cohort compared to the IBD control cohort. No patients required ICU care or intubation/respiratory support or were deceased in the Evusheld cohort.Our study did not show that Evusheld decreases the risk of COVID-19 in patients with IBD. Prevention of moderate-severe COVID-19 in these patients should focus on vaccination strategies and early COVID-19 therapies.© The Author(s) 2023.

  Title: Randomized controlled trial of hydrolyzed fish diets in dogs with chronic enteropathy.
  Keywords: cobalamin; curcumin; folate; inflammatory bowel disease; lymphangiectasia; prebiotics; protein-losing enteropathy
  PMID: 37680008
  Abstract: The role of diet in the pathogenesis and treatment of chronic enteropathies (CE) in dogs is unresolved.To compare the ability of diets composed of hydrolyzed fish, rice starch, and fish oil without (HF) or with prebiotics, turmeric, and high cobalamin (HF+) against a limited ingredient diet containing mixed nonhydrolyzed antigens and oils (control) to resolve clinical signs and maintain serum cobalamin and folate concentrations in dogs with nonprotein losing CE (non-PLE). To determine the ability of hydrolyzed fish diets to support recovery and remission in dogs with PLE.Thirty-one client-owned dogs with CE: 23 non-PLE, 8 PLE.Randomized, blinded, controlled trial. Diets were fed for 2 weeks; responders continued for 12 weeks. Nonresponders were crossed over to another diet for 12 weeks. Response was determined by standardized clinical evaluation with long-term follow-up at 26 weeks. Concurrent medications were allowed in PLE.Nineteen of 23 (83%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 60%-94%) non-PLE CE responded clinically to their initial diet, with no difference between diets (P > .05). Four nonresponders responded to another diet, with sustained remission of 18/18 (100%; 95%CI, 78%-100%) at 26 weeks. Serum cobalamin concentration was increased (P < .05) and maintained by diet. Serum folate concentration decreased posttreatment (P < .05) but was restored by dietary supplementation. Hydrolyzed fish diets supported weight gain, serum albumin concentration, and recovery (P < .05) in dogs with PLE.Changing diet, independent of antigen restriction or supplemental ingredients, induced long-term remission in dogs with non-PLE CE. Serum cobalamin and folate concentrations were maintained by diet. Hydrolyzed fish diets supported clinical recovery and remission in PLE.© 2023 The Authors.

  Title: Potential protective effects of the water-soluble Chinese propolis on experimental ulcerative colitis.
  Keywords: natural products; oxidative stress; pro-inflammatory cytokine; ulcerative colitis; water-soluble propolis
  PMID: 37679980
  Abstract: To investigate the outcome of Chinese water-soluble propolis (WSP) on the inflammatory response and oxidative stress (OS) of colonic mucosa in rats with ulcerative colitis.Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) was employed to establish the ucerative colitis (UC) rat model. Forty-eight male rats were arbitrarily separated into six groups, namely control, UC, low-dose water-soluble propolis (L-WSP), medium-dose water-soluble propolis (M-WSP), high-dose water-soluble propolis (H-WSP), and sulfasalazine (Sulfa). In this study, we adopted a method of pre-administration and reconstruction of the model that assessed the water-soluble propolis mediated protection against DSS-induced UC rats. Moreover, we examined the body weight (BW), disease activity index (DAI), bloody stool, colon length, and intestinal mucosal injury index of rats. In addition, using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays, we assessed indicators, such as, colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-9 (IL-9), tumor necrosis factor-ɑ (TNF-ɑ), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde, and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) levels.The pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, as well as OS, was increased in the model rats. However, upon WSP intervention, both pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and OS reduced dramatically, and the therapeutic effect was dose-dependent.WSP downregulates OS by enhancing the function of endogenous antioxidant enzymes like SOD and GSH-Px, that inhibit neutrophil activity, as well as diminish pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-ɑ, IL-6, and IL-9, along with mechanisms that attenuate intestinal inflammation in UC rat model.

  Title: METTL3-mediated m6 A modification of circPRKAR1B promotes Crohn's colitis by inducing pyroptosis via autophagy inhibition.
  Keywords: Crohn's disease; SPTBN1; autophagy; circPRKAR1B; m6A modification; pyroptosis
  PMID: 37679886
  Abstract: The roles of circRNA and N6-methyladenosine (m6 A) methylation in Crohn's disease (CD) have drawn much attention. Therefore, this investigation aimed to discover how the m6 A modification of circRNAs contributes to CD progression.The study performed circRNA sequencing on colon samples from four CD patients and four normal controls (NCs) to screen for dysregulated circRNAs. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to validate the candidate circRNA expression and determine its correlation to CD-associated inflammatory indicators. In vivo and in vitro investigations were conducted to examine the functions and pathways of circPRKAR1B in CD, besides investigating the m6 A modification role in circRNA expression modulation.The RNA-seq revealed that hsa_circ_0008039 (circPRKAR1B) was the most significant upregulated circRNA and was identified as the candidate circRNA for further examinations. Relative circPRKAR1B expression was significantly upregulated in CD colon tissues and closely related to CD-associated inflammatory indices. The circPRKAR1B expression and function were regulated by methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3)-mediated m6 A methylation. In vitro studies indicated that circPRKAR1B promoted pyroptosis mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome (NLRP3; nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing 3) and impaired autophagy by interacting with the RNA-binding protein (RBP) SPTBN1, (SPTBN1; spectrin beta, non-erythrocytic 1). The in vivo investigations revealed the treatment effects of si-circPRKAR1B and si-METTL3 in colitis models of IL-10-deficient mice.Our study reveals that METTL3-mediated m6 A modification of circPRKAR1B promotes Crohn's colitis by aggravating NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis via autophagy impairment in colonic epithelial cells.© 2023 The Authors.

  Title: "Dual sensitive supramolecular curcumin nanoparticles" in "advanced yeast particles" mediate macrophage reprogramming, ROS scavenging and inflammation resolution for ulcerative colitis treatment.
  Keywords: Curcumin; Macrophage targeting; Supramolecular nanoparticles; Ulcerative colitis; Yeast cell wall microparticles; pH/ROS dual-responsive
  PMID: 37679849
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) faces some barriers in oral therapy, such as how to safely deliver drugs to the colon and accumulate in the colon lesions. Hence, we report an advanced yeast particles system loaded with supramolecular nanoparticles with ROS scavenger (curcumin) to treat UC by reducing oxidative stress state and inflammatory response and accelerating the reprogramming of macrophages. In this study, the dual-sensitive materials are bonded on β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), the D-mannose (Man) is modified to adamantane (ADA), and then loaded with curcumin (CUR), to form a functional supramolecular nano-delivery system (Man-CUR NPs) through the host-guest interaction. To improve gastrointestinal stability and colonic accumulation of Man-CUR NPs, yeast cell wall microparticles (YPs) encapsulated Man-CUR NPs to form Man-CUR NYPs via electrostatic adsorption and vacuum extrusion technologies. As expected, the YPs showed the strong stability in complex gastrointestinal environment. In addition, the Man modified supramolecular nanoparticles demonstrated excellent targeting ability to macrophages in the in vitro cellular uptake study and the pH/ROS sensitive effect of Man-CUR NPs was confirmed by the pH/ROS-dual stimulation evaluation. They also enhanced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory model in macrophages through downregulation of pro-inflammatory factors, upregulation of anti-inflammatory factors, M2 macrophage polarization, and scavenging the excess ROS. Notably, in DSS-induced mice colitis model, Man-CUR NYPs can reduce the inflammatory responses by modulating TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways, alleviate oxidative stress by Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, promote macrophages reprogramming and improve the favorable recovery of the damaged colonic tissue. Taken together, this study not only provides strategy for "supramolecular curcumin nanoparticles with pH/ROS sensitive and multistage therapeutic effects" in "advanced yeast particles", but also provided strong theoretical support multi-effect therapy for UC.© 2023.

  Title: Disparities in access to minimally invasive surgery for inflammatory bowel disease and outcomes by insurance status: analysis of the 2015 to 2019 National Inpatient Sample.
  Keywords: Crohn’s disease; IBD; Inflammatory bowel disease; Minimally invasive surgery; NIS; Ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37679584
  Abstract: Despite being the preferred modality for treatment of colorectal cancer and diverticular disease, minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has been adopted slowly for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) due to its technical challenges. The present study aims to assess the disparities in use of MIS for patients with IBD.A retrospective analysis of the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database from October 2015 to December 2019 was conducted. Patients < 65 years of age were stratified by either private insurance or Medicaid. The primary outcome was access to MIS and secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, complications, length of stay (LOS), and total admission cost. Univariate and multivariate regression was utilized to determine the association between insurance status and outcomes.The NIS sample population included 7866 patients with private insurance and 1689 with Medicaid. Medicaid patients had lower odds of receiving MIS than private insurance patients (OR 0.85, 95% CI [0.74-0.97], p = 0.017), and experienced more postoperative genitourinary complications (OR 1.36, 95% CI [1.08-1.71], p = 0.009). In addition, LOS was longer by 1.76 days (p < 0.001) and the total cost was higher by $5043 USD (p < 0.001) in the Medicaid group. Independent predictors of receiving MIS were age < 40 years old, female sex, highest income quartile, diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, elective admission, and care at teaching hospitals.Patients with Medicaid are less likely to receive MIS, have longer lengths of stay, and incur higher costs for the surgical management of their IBD. Further investigations into disparities in inflammatory bowel disease care for Medicaid patients are warranted.© 2023.

  Title: Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine-induced intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy: Case report and review of the literature.
  Keywords: Azathioprine; Bile acids and salts; Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy; Mercaptopurine; Plasma exchange
  PMID: 37679010
  Abstract: Azathioprine, a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), is used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and may be continued during pregnancy. Acute cholestatic liver injury has been reported to occur with azathioprine. We aimed to examine azathioprine related cholestasis effect on pregnancy complications and outcome.We present a unique case of 6-MP-induced severe intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) that required meticulous combined therapy including plasma exchange. The symptoms resolved following 6-MP withdrawal. A literature review revealed 11 pregnancies complicated by early-induced severe ICP among women treated with azathioprine or 6-MP.We recommend weekly bile acid level tests for pregnant women treated with azathioprine or 6-MP, beginning early in the second trimester of pregnancy, and the prompt discontinuation of treatment upon establishment of an ICP diagnosis.Copyright © 2023.

  Title: SpA plus IBD or IBD plus SpA: Does commutative property apply?
  Keywords: Human leukocyte antigen; Inflammatory bowel diseases; Spondyloarthritis
  PMID: 37678619
  Abstract: The term spondyloarthritis (SpA) encompasses a group of interrelated disorders characterised by the involvement of the musculoskeletal system as well as extra-articular manifestations like acute anterior uveitis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Likewise, IBD may present with various extra-intestinal manifestations among which those involving the musculoskeletal system, namely peripheral and axial SpA are the most common. The identification of patients with both SpA and IBD is of paramount importance in clinical practice since the coexistence of these two entities has been associated with great disability and decreased quality of life. In order to achieve an early diagnosis of IBD-SpA it is instrumental that rheumatologists seek for gastrointestinal symptoms in SpA patients and likewise that gastroenterologists seek for inflammatory musculoskeletal symptoms in patients with IBD. This narrative review aims at critically appraising the available evidence about SpA occurring in IBD patients versus IBD occurring in patients with SpA and at highlighting similarities and differences between the two scenarios.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

  Title: Cannabinoids and the GI Tract.
  Keywords: cannabis; gastroparesis; inflammatory bowel diseases; nausea; pain disorders; vomiting
  PMID: 37678488
  Abstract: The synthesis and degradation of endocannabinoids, location of cannabinoid (CB) receptors, and cannabinoid mechanisms of action on immune/inflammatory, neuromuscular, and sensory functions in digestive organs are well documented. CB2 mechanisms are particularly relevant in immune and sensory functions. Increasing use of cannabinoids in the USA is impacted by social determinants of health including racial discrimination which is associated with tobacco and cannabis co-use, and combined use disorders. Several conditions associated with emesis are related to cannabinoid use, including cannabinoid hyperemesis or withdrawal, cyclic vomiting syndrome, nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Cannabinoids generally inhibit gastrointestinal motor function; yet they relieve symptoms in patients with gastroparesis and diverse nausea syndromes. Cannabinoid effects on inflammatory mechanisms have shown promise in relatively small placebo-controlled studies in reducing disease activity and abdominal pain in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Cannabinoids have been studied in disorders of motility, pain, and disorders of gut brain interaction. The CB2 receptor agonist, cannabidiol, reduced total Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index and increased ability to tolerate a meal in patients with gastroparesis appraised over 4 weeks of treatment. In contrast, predominant-pain endpoints in functional dyspepsia with normal gastric emptying were not significantly improved with cannabidiol. The CB2 agonist, olorinab, reduced abdominal pain in IBD in an open-label trial and in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome in a placebo-controlled trial. Cannabinoid mechanisms alter inflammation in pancreatic and liver diseases. In conclusion, cannabinoids, particularly agents affecting CB2 mechanisms, have potential for inflammatory, gastroparesis, and pain disorders; however, the trials require replication and further understanding of risk-benefit to enhance use of cannabinoids in gastrointestinal diseases.Copyright © 2023 AGA Institute.

  Title: Intestinal proteases.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37678185
  Abstract: Proteases constitute a group of enzymes that hydrolyze peptide bonds. Intestinal proteases are an integral part of gut homeostasis and digestion. This review discusses the broader classification of proteases, regulation of proteolytic activity (PA) in the intestinal tract, and how dysregulation of intestinal proteases contributes to the pathophysiology of conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and celiac disease. We also discuss recent advancements in therapeutic modulation that directly or indirectly target intestinal proteases and can be utilized to treat these illnesses.Host and microbiota derived proteases have been associated with symptoms in subsets of patients with IBS, IBD and celiac disease. Elevated PA mediates barrier dysfunction, visceral hypersensitivity as well as immune activation and inflammation. Recent mechanistic studies have revealed the nature of disease-associated proteases and mechanisms regulating their activity, particularly those driven by the microbiota. Advancements in activity-based probes have allowed novel ways of in vivo imaging of PA. Newer strategies targeting proteases include monoclonal antibodies, engineered microbiota as well as specific protease inhibitors.Significant progresses made in the detection as well as regulation of PA is likely to provide therapeutic advancements for gastrointestinal diseases.Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

  Title: Therapeutic potentials of mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in rats.

  PMID: 37676835
  Abstract: Interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) and interleukin-17A (IL-17A) have strong pro-inflammatory activities that are involved in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy is considered a promising treatment for IBD. This study was performed to understand the role of rat Nlrp3 inflammasome, Hmgb1, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-17a) in the pathogenesis of IBD. Also, to evaluate the role of human umbilical cord blood-MSCs (hUCB-MSCs) in the management of IBD. The rats were in four groups: normal controls, indomethacin-induced IBD group, indomethacin-induced IBD rats that received phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the IBD group that received hUCB-MSCs as a treatment. The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of rat Nlrp3, Hmgb1, IL-1β, and IL-17a were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Histopathological examination of the small intestinal tissues of the studied rats was performed. There was a significant upregulation of the rat Nlrp3, IL-1β, IL-17a mRNA expression (p < 0.001 for the three parameters), and Hmgb1 (p < 0.05) in the untreated IBD group compared to the normal control group. In the MSC-treated group, IL-1β, IL-17a, and rat Nlrp3 mRNA expression significantly decreased compared to both the untreated IBD group and PBS group (p < 0.05 for all). hUCB-MSCs ameliorated IBD in rats by downregulating the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-17a) and other inflammatory mediators such as Hmgb1 and rat Nlrp3.© 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

  Title: CIRCE: Web-Based Platform for the Prediction of Cannabinoid Receptor Ligands Using Explainable Machine Learning.
  Keywords: 
  PMID: 37675493
  Abstract: The endocannabinoid system, which includes cannabinoid receptor 1 and 2 subtypes (CB1R and CB2R, respectively), is responsible for the onset of various pathologies including neurodegeneration, cancer, neuropathic and inflammatory pain, obesity, and inflammatory bowel disease. Given the high similarity of CB1R and CB2R, generating subtype-selective ligands is still an open challenge. In this work, the Cannabinoid Iterative Revaluation for Classification and Explanation (CIRCE) compound prediction platform has been generated based on explainable machine learning to support the design of selective CB1R and CB2R ligands. Multilayer classifiers were combined with Shapley value analysis to facilitate explainable predictions. In test calculations, CIRCE predictions reached ∼80% accuracy and structural features determining ligand predictions were rationalized. CIRCE was designed as a web-based prediction platform that is made freely available as a part of our study.

  Title: MV-CVIB: a microbiome-based multi-view convolutional variational information bottleneck for predicting metastatic colorectal cancer.
  Keywords: information bottleneck; metastatic colorectal cancer; microbiome; multi-view; risk assessment
  PMID: 37675425
  Abstract: Imbalances in gut microbes have been implied in many human diseases, including colorectal cancer (CRC), inflammatory bowel disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, autism, and Alzheimer's disease. Compared with other human diseases, CRC is a gastrointestinal malignancy with high mortality and a high probability of metastasis. However, current studies mainly focus on the prediction of colorectal cancer while neglecting the more serious malignancy of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). In addition, high dimensionality and small samples lead to the complexity of gut microbial data, which increases the difficulty of traditional machine learning models.To address these challenges, we collected and processed 16S rRNA data and calculated abundance data from patients with non-metastatic colorectal cancer (non-mCRC) and mCRC. Different from the traditional health-disease classification strategy, we adopted a novel disease-disease classification strategy and proposed a microbiome-based multi-view convolutional variational information bottleneck (MV-CVIB).The experimental results show that MV-CVIB can effectively predict mCRC. This model can achieve AUC values above 0.9 compared to other state-of-the-art models. Not only that, MV-CVIB also achieved satisfactory predictive performance on multiple published CRC gut microbiome datasets.Finally, multiple gut microbiota analyses were used to elucidate communities and differences between mCRC and non-mCRC, and the metastatic properties of CRC were assessed by patient age and microbiota expression.Copyright © 2023 Cui, Wu, Zhang, Wang, He and Huang.

  Title: Mechanism of Qingchang Suppository on repairing the intestinal mucosal barrier in ulcerative colitis.
  Keywords: Qingchang Suppository; active ingredients; intestinal mucosal barrier; mechanism; ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37675045
  Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a refractory inflammatory bowel disease, and the outcomes of conventional therapies of UC, including 5-aminosalicylic acid, glucocorticoids, immunosuppressants, and biological agents, are not satisfied with patients and physicians with regard to adverse reactions and financial burden. The abnormality of the intestinal mucosal barrier in the pathogenesis of UC was verified. Qingchang Suppository (QCS) is an herbal preparation and is effective in treating ulcerative proctitis. The mechanism of QCS and its active ingredients have not been concluded especially in mucosal healing. This review elucidated the potential mechanism of QCS from the intestinal mucosal barrier perspective to help exploring future QCS research directions.Copyright © 2023 Shan, Liu, Liu, Yuan and Lin.

  Title: Oral-gut axis as a novel biological mechanism linking periodontal disease and systemic diseases: A review.
  Keywords: Gut microbiota; Oral microbiota; Periodontitis; Periodontopathic bacteria; Systemic diseases
  PMID: 37674899
  Abstract: Substantial evidence suggests that periodontal disease increases the risk of developing and progressing extraoral manifestations such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. The most probable causative mechanism behind this is the influx of bacteria and/or bacterial products (endotoxin) and inflammatory cytokines into the systemic circulation originating from inflamed periodontal tissues. However, recent studies have revealed that oral bacteria, especially periodontopathic bacteria, play a role in inducing dysbiosis of the gut microbiota resulting induction of gut dysbiosis-related pathology associated with systemic diseases. Conversely, the disruption of gut microbiota has been shown to have a negative impact on the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. Based on our study findings and the available literature, this review presents an overview of the relationship between periodontal disease and systemic health, highlighting the mouth-gut connection.© 2023 The Authors.

  Title: Cronkhite-Canada Syndrome Masquerading as Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Keywords: Cronkhite-Canada syndrome; gastrointestinal polyposis; inflammatory bowel disease
  PMID: 37674882
  Abstract: Cronkhite-Canada syndrome (CCS) is a rare nonhereditary gastrointestinal polyposis syndrome. We illustrate a case with clinical presentation of dysgeusia, chronic diarrhea and weight loss, and endoscopic features of diffuse gastric mucosa nodularity with circumferential nodular pancolitis and a solitary colonic polyp initially mimicking inflammatory bowel disease. After multidisciplinary discussion, the diagnosis of CCS was made. The patient received steroids with resultant clinical, endoscopic, and histological improvement. We discuss the treatment and risk of neoplasia in CCS.© 2023 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. on behalf of The American College of Gastroenterology.

  Title: The 2023 Impact of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Canada: Special Populations-IBD in Seniors.
  Keywords: Comorbidity; Crohn’s disease; Elderly; Risks; Ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37674503
  Abstract: Approximately one out of every 88 seniors has inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and this is expected to increase in the future. They are more likely to have left-sided disease in ulcerative colitis, and isolated colonic disease in Crohn's disease; perianal disease is less common. Other common diagnoses in the elderly must also be considered when they initially present to a healthcare provider. Treatment of the elderly is similar to younger persons with IBD, though considerations of the increased risk of infections and malignancy must be considered when using immune modulating drugs. Whether anti-TNF therapies increase the risk of infections is not definitive, though newer biologics, including vedolizumab and ustekinumab, are thought to be safer with lower risk of adverse events. Polypharmacy and frailty are other considerations in the elderly when choosing a treatment, as frailty is associated with worse outcomes. Costs for IBD-related hospitalizations are higher in the elderly compared with younger persons. When elderly persons with IBD are cared for by a gastroenterologist, their outcomes tend to be better. However, as elderly persons with IBD continue to age, they may not have access to the same care as younger people with IBD due to deficiencies in their ability to use or access technology.© The Author(s) 2023.

  Title: The 2023 Impact of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Canada: Cancer and IBD.
  Keywords: Cancer; Crohn’s Disease; Screening; Surveillance; Ulcerative Colitis
  PMID: 37674502
  Abstract: Cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Intestinal cancers may arise as a complication of IBD itself, while extra-intestinal cancers may arise due to some of the immunosuppressive therapies used to treat IBD. Colorectal cancer (CRC) and small bowel cancer risks remain elevated among persons with IBD as compared to age-and sex-matched members of the general population, and the lifetime risk of these cancers is strongly correlated to cumulative intestinal inflammatory burden. However, the cumulative risk of cancer, even among those with IBD is still low. Some studies suggest that IBD-CRC incidence has declined over the years, possibly owing to improved treatment standards and improved detection and management of early neoplastic lesions. Across studies of extra-intestinal cancers, there are generally higher incidences of melanoma, hepatobiliary cancer, and lung cancer and no higher incidences of breast cancer or prostate cancer, with equivocal risk of cervical cancer, among persons with IBD. While the relative risks of some extra-intestinal cancers are increased with treatment, the absolute risks of these cancers remain low and the decision to forego treatment in light of these risks should be carefully weighed against the increased risks of intestinal cancers and other disease-related complications with undertreated inflammatory disease. Quality improvement efforts should focus on optimized surveillance of cancers for which surveillance strategies exist (colorectal cancer, hepatobiliary cancer, cervical cancers, and skin cancers) and the development of cost-effective surveillance strategies for less common cancers associated with IBD.© The Author(s) 2023.

  Title: The 2023 Impact of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Canada: Treatment Landscape.
  Keywords: Biologic; Biosimilar; Crohn’s disease; Management; Therapy; Ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37674501
  Abstract: The therapeutic landscape for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has changed considerably over the past two decades, owing to the development and widespread penetration of targeted therapies, including biologics and small molecules. While some conventional treatments continue to have an important role in the management of IBD, treatment of IBD is increasingly moving towards targeted therapies given their greater efficacy and safety in comparison to conventional agents. Early introduction of these therapies-particularly in persons with Crohn's disease-combining targeted therapies with traditional anti-metabolite immunomodulators and targeting objective markers of disease activity (in addition to symptoms), have been shown to improve health outcomes and will be increasingly adopted over time. The substantially increased costs associated with targeted therapies has led to a ballooning of healthcare expenditure to treat IBD over the past 15 years. The introduction of less expensive biosimilar anti-tumour necrosis factor therapies may bend this cost curve downwards, potentially allowing for more widespread access to these medications. Newer therapies targeting different inflammatory pathways and complementary and alternative therapies (including novel diets) will continue to shape the IBD treatment landscape. More precise use of a growing number of targeted therapies in the right individuals at the right time will help minimize the development of expensive and disabling complications, which has the potential to further reduce costs and improve outcomes.© The Author(s) 2023.

  Title: The 2023 Impact of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Canada: Executive Summary.
  Keywords: Comorbidities; Crohn’s disease; Issues affecting the IBD community; Treatment; Ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37674500
  Abstract: The burden of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (i.e., associated direct and indirect costs, prevalence of disease, personal impact to the individual and to caregivers) continues to increase in Canada. The prevalence of IBD has increased since Crohn's and Colitis Canada's 2018 Impact of IBD report from an estimated 270,000 Canadians living with IBD in 2018 to an estimated 322,600 Canadians living with IBD today in 2023. Consequently, associated costs of IBD have also dramatically increased from an estimated $2.57 billion in 2018 to an estimated $5.38 billion in 2023; this increase is due to multiple factors including increased prevalence of disease, inflation, and additional identified factors (e.g., presenteeism, costs of childcare). Beyond the economic impact of IBD, these diseases have a significant impact on people living with the disease and their caregivers, including different presentations of disease, different commonly associated extra-intestinal manifestations or comorbid conditions, and different barriers to accessing care. In this supplementary issue, we review: Evolving trends in the epidemiology of IBD; updated estimates of indirect and direct costs (including out-of-pocket costs) associated with IBD; information specific to IBD in children, adolescents, and seniors; issues related to IBD pertaining to sex and gender; information specific to risks associated with COVID-19 and cancer related to IBD; an overview of current treatments for IBD; and evolving care models, including access to care.© The Author(s) 2023.

  Title: The 2023 Impact of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Canada: Mental Health and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Keywords: Anxiety; Crohn’s disease; Depression; Mental health; Ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37674499
  Abstract: Psychiatric disorders are 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in persons with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) than in the general population, with pooled prevalence estimates of 21% for clinical anxiety and 15% for depression. Rates are even higher when considering mental health symptoms, as nearly one-third of persons with IBD experience elevated anxiety symptoms and one-quarter experience depression symptoms. Rates of these symptoms were much higher during periods of disease activity, more common in women than men, and more common in Crohn's disease than ulcerative colitis. There is robust evidence of the detrimental effects of comorbid depression and anxiety on the subsequent course of IBD based on longitudinal studies tracking outcomes over time. However, psychiatric disorders and IBD have bidirectional effects, with each affecting risk of the other. Elevated mental health concerns have been consistently associated with greater healthcare utilization and costs related to IBD. There is some signal that low resilience in adolescence could be a risk factor for developing IBD and that enhancing resilience may improve mental health and intestinal disease outcomes in IBD. Psychological therapies used to treat anxiety and depression occurring in the context of IBD have been shown to significantly improve the quality of life for persons with IBD and reduce anxiety and depression. There is less evidence in regard to the impact of psychotropic medications on mental health or disease outcomes in persons with IBD. There is consensus, however, that mental health must be addressed as part of comprehensive IBD care for children and adults.© The Author(s) 2023.

  Title: The 2023 Impact of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Canada: The Influence of Sex and Gender on Canadians Living With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
  Keywords: Crohn’s disease; Healthcare access; Healthcare utilization; Pregnancy; Ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37674498
  Abstract: Sex (the physical and physiologic effects resulting from having specific combinations of sex chromosomes) and gender (sex-associated behaviours, expectations, identities, and roles) significantly affect the course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the experience of living with IBD. Sex-influenced physiologic states, like puberty, the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and andropause/menopause may also impact and be impacted by IBD. While neither Crohn's disease nor ulcerative colitis is commonly considered sex-determined illnesses, the relative incidence of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis between males and females varies over the life cycle. In terms of gender, women tend to use healthcare resources at slightly higher rates than men and are more likely to have fragmented care. Women are more commonly prescribed opioid medications and are less likely than men to undergo colectomy. Women tend to report lower quality of life and have higher indirect costs due to higher rates of disability. Women are also more likely to take on caregiver roles for children with IBD. Women with IBD are more commonly burdened with adverse mental health concerns and having poor mental health has a more profound impact on women than men. Pregnant people with active IBD have higher rates of adverse outcomes in pregnancy, made worse in regions with poor access to IBD specialist care. The majority of individuals with IBD in Canada do not have access to a pregnancy-in-IBD specialist; access to this type of care has been shown to allay fears and increase knowledge among pregnant people with IBD.© The Author(s) 2023.

  Title: The 2023 Impact of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Canada: Special Populations-Children and Adolescents with IBD.
  Keywords: Crohn’s disease; Paediatrics; Transition; Ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37674497
  Abstract: Rates of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Canadian children and adolescents are among the highest in the world, and the incidence is rising most rapidly in children under five years of age. These young children may have either a typical form of IBD with multi-factorial aetiology, or they may have a monogenic form. Despite the growing number of children in Canada living with this important chronic disease, there are few available medical therapies approved by Health Canada due to the omission of children from most clinical trials of newly developed biologics. As a result, off-label use of medications is common, and physicians have learned to use existing therapies more effectively. In addition, most Canadian children are treated in multidisciplinary, specialty clinics by physicians with extra training or experience in IBD, as well as specialist nurses, dietitians, mental health care providers and other allied health professionals. This specialized clinic approach has facilitated cutting edge research, led by Canadian clinicians and scientists, to understand the causes of IBD, the optimal use of therapies, and the best ways to treat children from a biopsychosocial perspective. Canadians are engaged in work to understand the monogenic causes of IBD; the interaction between genes, the environment, and the microbiome; and how to address the mental health concerns and medical needs of adolescents and young adults transitioning from paediatric to adult care.© The Author(s) 2023.

  Title: The 2023 Impact of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Canada: Access to and Models of Care.
  Keywords: Disease monitoring; Integrated care models; Person-centered care; Quality of care; eHealth
  PMID: 37674496
  Abstract: Rising compounding prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Kaplan GG, Windsor JW. The four epidemiological stages in the global evolution of inflammatory bowel disease. Nat Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2021;18:56-66.) and pandemic-exacerbated health system resource limitations have resulted in significant variability in access to high-quality, evidence-based, person-centered specialty care for Canadians living with IBD. Individuals with IBD have identified long wait times, gaps in biopsychosocial care, treatment and travel expenses, and geographic and provider variation in IBD specialty care and knowledge as some of the key barriers to access. Care delivered within integrated models of care (IMC) has shown promise related to impact on disease-related outcomes and quality of life. However, access to these models is limited within the Canadian healthcare systems and much remains to be learned about the most appropriate IMC team composition and roles. Although eHealth technologies have been leveraged to overcome some access challenges since COVID-19, more research is needed to understand how best to integrate eHealth modalities (i.e., video or telephone visits) into routine IBD care. Many individuals with IBD are satisfied with these eHealth modalities. However, not all disease assessment and monitoring can be achieved through virtual modalities. The need for access to person-centered, objective disease monitoring strategies, inclusive of point of care intestinal ultrasound, is more pressing than ever given pandemic-exacerbated restrictions in access to endoscopy and cross-sectional imaging. Supporting learning healthcare systems for IBD and research relating to the strategic use of innovative and integrative implementation strategies for evidence-based IBD care interventions are greatly needed. Data derived from this research will be essential to appropriately allocating scarce resources aimed at improving person-centred access to cost-effective IBD care.© The Author(s) 2023.

  Title: The 2023 Impact of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Canada: Indirect (Individual and Societal) and Direct Out-of-Pocket Costs.
  Keywords: Absenteeism; Caregiving costs; Crohn’s disease; Lost productivity; Presenteeism; Ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37674495
  Abstract: People living with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and their caregivers are faced with indirect and out-of-pocket costs that they would not otherwise experience. These costs impact one's ability to contribute to the economy to their fullest potential. The indirect costs of IBD in Canada are estimated to be at least $1.51 billion in 2023 and include costs associated with lost productivity resulting from a combination of missed work (absenteeism), decreased workplace productivity (presenteeism), unemployment, premature mortality, and caregiving costs. Unemployment is the largest contributor to indirect costs ($1.14 billion), followed by costs of absenteeism and presenteeism ($285 million). Caregiving costs for children with IBD are estimated to be nearly $58 million. Canadians with IBD also pay $536 million every year for care that is not covered by universal or supplemental private health insurance; this includes allied healthcare (e.g., care provided by psychologists), medication, and other supportive therapy. Combined, the indirect and out-of-pocket costs of IBD in Canada are estimated at more than $2 billion CAD in 2023. This is substantially higher than the estimate of $1.29 billion in Crohn's and Colitis Canada's 2018 Impact of IBD report with differences attributable to a combination of rising prevalence, inflation, and the addition of presenteeism and caregiving costs to the total indirect costs.© The Author(s) 2023.

  Title: The 2023 Impact of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Canada: COVID-19 and IBD.
  Keywords: -Ulcerative colitis; Coronavirus; Crohn’s disease; SARS-CoV-2
  PMID: 37674494
  Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic had a monumental impact on the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) community. At the beginning of the pandemic, knowledge on the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on IBD was lacking, especially in those with medication-suppressed immune systems. Throughout the pandemic, scientific literature exponentially expanded, resulting in clinical guidance and vaccine recommendations for individuals with IBD. Crohn's and Colitis Canada established the COVID-19 and IBD Taskforce to process and communicate rapidly transforming knowledge into guidance for individuals with IBD and their caregivers, healthcare providers, and policy makers. Recommendations at the onset of the pandemic were based on conjecture from experience of prior viruses, with a precautionary principle in mind. We now know that the risk of acquiring COVID-19 in those with IBD is the same as the general population. As with healthy populations, advanced age and comorbidities increase the risk for severe COVID-19. Individuals with IBD who are actively flaring and/or who require high doses of prednisone are susceptible to severe COVID-19 outcomes. Consequently, sustaining maintenance therapies (e.g., biologics) is recommended. A three-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine regimen in those with IBD produces a robust antibody response with a similar adverse event profile as the general population. Breakthrough infections following vaccine have been observed, particularly as the virus continues to evolve, which supports receiving a bivalent vaccine booster. Limited data exist on the impact of IBD and its therapies on long-term outcomes following COVID-19. Ongoing research is necessary to address new concerns manifesting in those with IBD throughout the evolving pandemic.© The Author(s) 2023.

  Title: The 2023 Impact of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Canada: Direct Health System and Medication Costs.
  Keywords: Crohn’s disease; Direct costs; Health services utilization; Ulcerative colitis
  PMID: 37674493
  Abstract: Healthcare utilization among people living with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Canada has shifted from inpatient management to outpatient management; fewer people with IBD are admitted to hospitals or undergo surgery, but outpatient visits have become more frequent. Although the frequency of emergency department (ED) visits among adults and seniors with IBD decreased, the frequency of ED visits among children with IBD increased. Additionally, there is variation in the utilization of IBD health services within and between provinces and across ethnocultural and sociodemographic groups. For example, First Nations individuals with IBD are more likely to be hospitalized than the general IBD population. South Asian children with Crohn's disease are hospitalized more often than their Caucasian peers at diagnosis, but not during follow-up. Immigrants to Canada who develop IBD have higher health services utilization, but a lower risk of surgery compared to individuals born in Canada. The total direct healthcare costs of IBD, including the cost of hospitalizations, ED visits, outpatient visits, endoscopy, cross-sectional imaging, and medications are rising rapidly. The direct health system and medication costs of IBD in Canada are estimated to be $3.33 billion in 2023, potentially ranging from $2.19 billion to $4.47 billion. This is an increase from an estimated $1.28 billion in 2018, likely due to sharp increases in the use of biologic therapy over the past two decades. In 2017, 50% of total direct healthcare costs can be attributed to biologic therapies; the proportion of total direct healthcare costs attributed to biologic therapies today is likely even greater.© The Author(s) 2023.

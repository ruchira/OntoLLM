title: Chemical and Disease Entity Recognition Template
description: >-
  A template for Chemical and Disease named entity recognition.

  This template is intended to represent entities (chemicals and diseases),
  and for evaluating SPIRES against the BioCreative V Disease Named Entity
  Recognition (DNER) results. As the test set also contains chemical names,
  it is also appropriate to use this template for evaluating chemical NER.

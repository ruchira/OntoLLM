# TODO: LOINC isn't great for grounding,

  DiagnosticProceduretoPhenotypeAssociation:
    is_a: Triple
    description: >- 
      A triple representing a relationship between a diagnostic
      procedure and an associated phenotype, e.g., "blood pressure measurement"
      is associated with "high blood pressure".
    slot_usage:
      subject:
        range: DiagnosticProcedure
        description: >-
          A diagnostic procedure yielding a result, which in turn
          may be interpreted as a phenotype.
          Procedures include "heart rate measurement", "blood pressure measurement",
          "oxygen saturation measurement", etc. In practice, procedures may be
          named based on what they measure, with the "measurement" part left implicit.
      object:
        range: Phenotype
        multivalued: true
        description: >-
          The observable physical or biochemical characteristics of a patient.
          Not equivalent to a disease state, but may contribute to a diagnosis.
      predicate:
        range: ProcedureToPhenotypePredicate
        description: The relationship type, e.g. RELATED_TO
      subject_qualifier:
        range: NamedEntity
        description: >-
          An optional qualifier or modifier for the procedure.
      object_qualifier:
        range: NamedEntity
        description: >-
          An optional qualifier or modifier for the phenotype.

  DiagnosticProceduretoAttributeAssociation:
    is_a: Triple
    description: >- 
      A triple representing a relationship between a diagnostic
      procedure and a measured attribute, e.g., "blood pressure measurement"
      is associated with "blood pressure" (or in OBA, something like
      OBA:VT0000183, "blood pressure trait").
    slot_usage:
      subject:
        range: DiagnosticProcedure
        description: >-
          A diagnostic procedure yielding a result, which in turn
          may be interpreted as a phenotype.

      object:
        range: ClinicalAttribute
        multivalued: true
        description: >-
          Any measurable clinical attribute.
      predicate:
        range: ProcedureToAttributePredicate
        description: The relationship type, e.g. RELATED_TO
      subject_qualifier:
        range: NamedEntity
        description: >-
          An optional qualifier or modifier for the procedure.
      object_qualifier:
        range: Quality
        description: >-
          An optional qualifier or modifier for the phenotype.

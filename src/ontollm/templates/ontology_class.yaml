        description: the name of the main entity being defined
      description:
        description: a textual description of the entity
      synonyms:
        description: alternative names of the entity
        multivalued: true

        description: >-
          the categories to which this entity belongs.
        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            semicolon-separated list of categories to which the entity belongs.
            These may be taken from an upper
            level ontology such as COB, BioLink, or UMLS semantic types.
        range:  OntologyClass

      subclass_of:
        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            semicolon-separated list of parent classes, indicating broader concepts.
            E.g. if the input text is "a type of bone", then the parent class is "bone"
        range:  OntologyClass

      logical_definition:
        description: the necessary and sufficient conditions for this entity to be an instance of this class
        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            the necessary and sufficient conditions for this entity to be an instance of this class,
            written in OWL manchester syntax, e.g. bone and (part_of some 'hand')
        range: LogicalDefinition

      genus:
        range: OntologyClass
        multivalued: true
        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            in a logical definition expression, this is the parent (genus) class,
            e.g. bone
      differentiating_characteristic_relationship:
        range: Relation
        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            in a logical definition expression, this is the parent (differentiating characteristic) relationship type,
            e.g. part of
      differentiating_characteristic_parents:
        range: OntologyClass
        multivalued: true
        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            in a logical definition expression, this the parent (differentiating characteristic) class,
            e.g. hand

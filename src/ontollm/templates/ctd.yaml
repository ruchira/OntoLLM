title: Chemical to Disease Template
description: >-
  A template for Chemical to Disease associations.
  
  This template is intended to represent associations between chemicals and diseases,
  and for evaluating Semantic Llama against BioCreative V Chemical Disease
  Relation (CDR) Task (BC5CDR).

  ChemicalToDiseaseDocument:
    description: A document that contains chemical to disease relations.
    is_a: TextWithTriples
    slot_usage:
      triples:
        range: ChemicalToDiseaseRelationship
        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            A semi-colon separated list of chemical to disease relationships, where the relationship is either INDUCES
            or TREATS.
            for example: Lidocaine INDUCES cardiac asystole; 
            Hydroxychloroquine NOT TREATS COVID-19;
            Methyldopa INDUCES Hypotension;
            Monosodium Glutamate NOT INDUCES Headache;
            Imatinib TREATS cancer
          exclude: Lidocaine, cardiac asystole, Hydroxychloroquine, COVID-19, Methyldopa, Headache, Imatinib, cancer


  ChemicalToDiseaseRelationship:
    is_a: Triple
    description: A triple where the subject is a chemical and the object is a disease.
    slot_usage:
      subject:
        range: Chemical
        description: >-
          The chemical substance, drug, or small molecule. 
          For example: Lidocaine, Monosodium Glutamate, Imatinib.
      object:
        range: Disease
        description: >-
          The disease or condition that is being treated or induced by the chemical.
          For example, asthma, cancer, covid-19, cardiac asystole, Hypotension, Headache.
      predicate:
        range: ChemicalToDiseasePredicate
        description: The relationship type, e.g. INDUCES, TREATS.
      subject_qualifier:
        range: NamedEntity
        description: >-

      object_qualifier:
        range: NamedEntity
        description: >-
          An optional qualifier or modifier for the disease, e.g. "severe" or "with additional complications"
